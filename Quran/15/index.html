is clear from its topics and style that the period of its revelation
is about the same as that of Surah Ibrahim, for two things are quite
prominent in its background. First, it appears from the repeated
warnings in this Surah that in spite of the fact that the Holy
Prophet had been propagating the Message for many years, his people
in general had not shown any inclination towards its acceptance nay,
they had become more and more obdurate and stubborn in their
antagonism, enmity and ridicule with the passage of time. Secondly,
by that time the Holy Prophet had begun to feel a little tired of
making strenuous efforts to eradicate disbelief and opposition of his
people. That is why Allah has consoled and comforted him over and
over again by way of encouragement. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

The time is not far when the same people who have today refused to
accept (the Message of Islam) will regret and say, &quot;we wish we
had surrendered to it!&quot; Leave them alone to eat, drink and be
merry and to be deluded by false hopes. They will soon realize it. We
had prescribed a respite for every habitation that we destroyed
before this.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A>

O Muhammad! Already We have sent Messengers before you among many of
the ancient peoples. But they mocked at each of the Messengers who
came to them. Though We cause it (Admonition) to enter into their
hearts (like a rod), they would not believe in it.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
And the same has been the way of such people since ancient times.
Even if We had opened a gate for them in heaven, and they had begun
to ascend through it higher during day time, they would have said.
&quot;Our eyes have been dazzled; nay, we have been bewitched.&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	In XXXVII: 10, the same thing has been called shihab-i-thaqib

	not necessarily be a &quot;meteor&quot; for it is just possible that

	Anyhow if the &quot;fiery flame&quot; that pursues Satans may be
	taken to be a meteor, a countless number of these can form a

	billions of these meteors are rushing from space in mass of
	&quot;rainfall&quot; towards the earth's atmosphere. Such a scene

	guarded each of these spheres by invisible &quot;walls&quot; against
	each other. That is why our &quot;planet&quot; has remained safe in
	spite of the occasional &quot;rainfall&quot; of countless meteors.
	For as soon as they cross the protective wall of our sphere, they
	are burnt to ashes. But sometimes a meteorite reaches the earth from
	outer space as if to warn the dwellers of this planet of the
	existence of the &quot;power&quot; of the Creator. For instance, the
	biggest of these weighs 645 pounds and it is obvious from this that
	if the earth had not been made safe and secure by means of

	the story has been related in brief. But we learn from XI: 77-83
	that Prophet Lot was greatly perturbed and distressed at the visit
	of the angels. He said to himself, &quot;This is a day of woe.&quot;
	The reason why he was distressed, as implied in the Qur'an and
	explicitly expressed in the Traditions, was that the angels had come
	to Prophet Lot in the shape of beautiful boys, and he knew how
	perverse and wicked his people were. He was distressed for he could
	not send them away because they were his guests, and because he did
	not know how to protect them from those villains.</P>

	should stop to see the fun, when you heard the cries of the smitten
	people. For it is neither the time of enjoying &quot;fun&quot;, nor
	of shedding tears of regret. If you stop even for a minute in the
	territory of the smitten people you also might get hurt from the

<DIV ID="sdfootnote39">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote39sym" HREF="#sdfootnote39anc">39</A>This
	shows that those People had gone to the lowest depths of immorality.
	No sooner did they hear the news of the arrival of handsome
	strangers in their town than they rushed rejoicing to the house of
	Prophet Lot and impudently demanded that he should hand over his
	guests to them for the gratification of their lust. The pity is that
	there had remained not a single person among them to make a protest
	against such a heinous sin. Moreover, this shows that all of them,
	as a community, had totally lost every sense of decency, and they
	felt no shame at all to make such a wicked demand on him openly. The
	very fact, that they felt no hesitation in making such a wicked
	demand brazen- facedly from a pious and holy man like Prophet Lot,
	shows that the heinous crime was so common among them that they
	would not spare anyone.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Talmud records many instances of the all-round moral degradation of
	the people of Lot. Once a stranger was passing through their
	territory. He was forced by coming darkness to pass the night near
	Sodom. As he had his own provisions with him, he did not stand in
	any need of help from the towns-folk; so he lay under a tree to pass
	the night. But a Sodomite entreated him to accompany him to his
	house. During the night he did away with the ass and merchandise of
	the stranger. When he began to cry for help in the morning, the
	towns-folk came there not to help him but to rob him of what had
	been left with him.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On one
	occasion Hadrat Sarah sent her slave to Sodom to inquire after
	Prophet Lot's household. When the slave entered the town, he saw
	that a Sodomite was beating a stranger. Naturally the slave of
	Hadrat Sarah tried to rouse his sense of decency, saying, &quot;why
	do you ill-treat helpless strangers like this?&quot; In answer to
	this appeal, his head was broken in public.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On
	another occasion a poor man happened to come to Sodom but no one
	gave him anything to eat. When he was half dead with starvation, he
	fell to the ground in a helpless plight. A daughter of Prophet Lot
	saw him and sent some food for him. At this the Sodomites reproached
	Prophet Lot and his daughter and threatened to expel them from
	there, if they would not refrain from such &quot;deeds&quot;!</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After
	citing several similar incidents, the Talmud says that those people
	had become so cruel, so deceitful and so dishonest in their dealings
	that no traveler could pass safe through their territory nor could a
	poor person expect any food or help from them. Many a time it so
	happened that a poor stranger came there, and died from hunger. Then
	they would strip the clothes from his body and bury him naked! If a
	foreigner committed the blunder of visiting their territory, they
	would publicly rob him of everything, and make fool of him if he
	appealed to them to redress the wrong. Then they would openly commit
	shameless deeds in the gardens which they had grown in their valley
	because there was none to rebuke them except Prophet Lot. The Quran
	has summed up the whole of their wicked story in two concise
	sentences:(1) &quot;.They had already been committing very wicked
	deeds&quot; XI: 78, and (2) &quot;You gratify your lust with males:
	you rob travelers, and you commit wicked deeds publicly in your
	assemblies.&quot;</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote40">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote40sym" HREF="#sdfootnote40anc">40</A>In
	E.N. 87 of Surah Hud, it has been explained what Prophet Lot meant
	by this. It may also be added that such words as these were uttered
	by an honorable man like him in the last resort, when all his
	entreaties and earnest requests had failed to prevent those people
	from their evil designs towards his guests.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here it
	will be worthwhile to clear the significance of the words which were
	uttered by Prophet Lot as they occur in Surah Hud (v. 78). When he
	entreated those wicked people not to molest his guests, saying,
	&quot;Here are my daughters....&quot;, he was unaware that his
	guests were angels in the disguise of handsome boys. The angels
	revealed their identity only when the wicked crowd gathered at the
	residence of his guests and began to threaten them with their wicked
	designs, and Prophet Lot began to lament, &quot;I wish I had the
	power to set you right or I could find some strong support for
	refuge.&quot; It was then that the angels revealed themselves,
	saying, &quot;We are envoys sent by your Lord.... &quot; This
	sequence of events shows that Prophet Lot had made that &quot;offer&quot;
	only when he had felt to be utterly helpless.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is
	very important to keep this in view because the sequences of events
	in this Surah is different from that in Surah Hud. One is liable to
	have a misunderstanding as to why Prophet Lot wailed and lamented
	when he knew all the while that his guests were angels and could
	defend themselves against those wicked people.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the apparent difference between the two sequences, it may be
	pointed out that here the important thing to be stated is that the
	angels come with the truth. Therefore that part of the story (vv.
	61-66) has been related first in order to make the point more
	prominent.

	mention of the precious gift of the Glorious Qur'an has been made
	also to console the Holy Prophet and his followers that they should
	not even look at the worldly wealth of their opponents because that
	was nothing as compared with this precious wealth. In order to grasp
	the full significance of this, one should keep in view the fact that
	at that time the Holy Prophet and his Companions were suffering
	badly from poverty. The trading activities of the Holy Prophet had
	almost come to an end during the period in which he had been engaged
	in his Mission. Besides this, he had almost used up the whole wealth
	of Hadrat Khaijah. As regards his Companions, some of the young men
	had been turned out of their homes and reduced to poverty. The
	economic boycott had mined the business of those who were engaged in
	trade. There were others who were mere slaves or proteges of the
	Quraish and had no economic position whatever. In addition to their
	sad economic plight, all the Muslims, along with the Holy Prophet,
	were suffering persecution from the people of Makkah and its
	surroundings, In short, they were so much persecuted, ridiculed and
	insulted that no one of them was safe from physical and mental
	torture. On the other side, the Quraish, their opponents and
	persecutors, enjoyed all the good things of this world, and lived
	lives of happiness and luxury. This is the background of the
	reassurance given to the Believers, as if to say, &quot;Why should
	you feel disheartened at this? We have given you &quot;wealth&quot;
	which surpasses all kinds of worldly riches. Therefore, your
	opponents should envy your knowledge and high morals; you need not
	envy their ill-canned wealth and their wicked enjoyments, for when
	they will go before their Lord, they themselves will find that they
	had not brought such wealth as carries any value there. &quot;&nbsp;
