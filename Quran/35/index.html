frustrate it are not directed against him but against your own

If you use your common sense, you will come to the conclusion that
there is no being, beside Allah, Creator of the Universe, which might
possess divine attributes and powers and authority. He tells you that
you have not been created to be irresponsible in this world, but you
have to render an account of your deeds before your God, and that
there is life after the life of this world when everyone will meet
the consequences of what he has done here. If you thing a little you
will see that your doubts and your astonishment about it are
absolutely baseless. Don't you see the phenomenon of the reproduction
of creation day and night. How can then your own recreation be
impossible for that God Who created you from an insignificant sperm
drop? Doesn't your own intellect testify that the good and the evil
cannot be alike? Then think and judge for yourselves as to what is
reasonable, should the good and the evil meet with the same fate and
end up in the dust, or should the good be requited with good and the
evil with evil? Now, if you do not admit and acknowledge these
rational and reasonable things and do not abandon your false gods,
and wish to continue living only as irresponsible people in the
world, the Prophet will not lose anything. It is you yourselves only
who will suffer the consequences. The Prophet's only responsibility
was to make the truth plain to you, which be has done.&quot;</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

this connection, the Holy Prophet has been consoled again and again,
as if to say :&quot;When you are doing full justice to the preaching
of your mission, you do not incur any responsibility for those who
persist in their error and do not accept and follow the right way.&quot;
Furthermore, he has also been consoled to the effect &quot;You should
neither grieve on account of those who do not want to believe, nor
consume yourself with the thought of how to bring them to the rights
path. Instead of this, you should pay your full attention to those
who are inclined to listen to you.&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

on the plotters themselves. Now, are these people awaiting that they

you see that a power can turn the Way of Allah from its appointed
course. Have they never traveled about in the land that they could
see the end of those who have passed before them, and who were far
mightier than they? There is nothing that could make Allah helpless,
neither in the heavens nor in the earth: He knows everything and has
power over everything. If Allah were to seize the people for their
misdeeds, He would not have left alive any living being on the earth.
But He is giving them respite till an appointed time. So, when the
appointed time comes, Allah will Himself see His servants. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	insertion of the words &quot;Allah lends astray whomsoever He
	pleases and shows the Right Way to whomsoever He pleases&quot;,
	between the preceding and this sentence, clearly gives the meaning
	that Allah deprives, of the grace of guidance, those who become so
	perverted mentally, and leaves them to wander aimlessly in the ways
	in which they themselves wish to remain lost. After making the Holy
	Prophet realize this fact Allah exhorts him to the effect: &quot;It
	is not within your power to bring such people to the right path;
	therefore, have patience in their regard. Just as Allah is
	indifferent about them, so should you also avoid being unduly

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, one
	should bear in mind two things very clearly. First, the people being
	mentioned here were not the common people, but the chiefs of Makkah.
	who were employing every falsehood, every fraud and every trick to
	defeat the mission of the Holy Prophet. These people were in fact
	not involved in any misunderstanding about the Holy Prophet. They
	knew full well what he was calling theta to and what were the evils
	and moral weaknesses which they themselves were striving to
	maintain. After knowing and understanding All this they had firmly
	resolved not to let him succeed in his object, and for this purpose
	they did not feel any hesitation in using any mean or petty device.
	Now, evidently the people who deliberately and after annual
	consultation invent a new falsehood every next day and spread it
	against a person, can deceive the whole world but as for themselves
	they know that they are the liars and that the person whom they have
	accused is free of every blame. Then, if the person against whom the
	false propaganda is being made also does not react and respond in a
	way opposed to truth and righteousness, the unjust people also
	cannot help realizing that their opponent is a truthful and honest
	man. If in spite of this the people do not feel ashamed of their
	misconduct and continue to oppose and resist the truth with
	falsehood. their conduct itself testifies that they are under
	Allah's curse and they can no longer discriminate between good and
	evil. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	if Allah had only meant to make His Prophet understand the supreme
	truth, He could have secretly made him aware of this. There was no
	need to proclaim it openly in the Revelation. To mention it in the
	Qur'an and to proclaim it to the world was in fact meant to warn the
	common people that the leaders and the religious guides whom they
	were following blindly were the people of perverted mentality. whose
	mean conduct was itself an evidence that they were under the curse
	of Allah.&nbsp;

	correct point of view may have been expressed and presented. Then
	the thing which makes the pure word rise and prosper is the action
	which conforms to it. Wherever the word is pure but the action

	unless it is supported and confirmed by a person's action. For
	instance, if a person says that he regards Allah, the One, alone as
	his Deity, but worships others than Allah in practical life, his
	action belies his word. If a person says that he regards the wine as

	there has been no community in the world for whose guidance Allah
	did not appoint the Prophets, has been stated at several places in
	the Qur'an. In Surah Ar-Ra'd: 7, it was said: &quot;Every people has
	its guide ;&quot; in Surah Al-Hijr: 10: &quot;O Prophet, We have
	already sent Messengers before you among many of the ancient
	peoples;&quot; in Surah An-Nahl: 36: &quot;We sent to every
	community a Messenger;&quot; and in Surah Ash-Shu'ara: 208: &quot;We
	have never destroyed a habitation unless it had its warners to
	administer admonition. &quot; But, in this connection, one should
	note two things so that there remains no misunderstanding. First,
	one and the same Prophet is enough for the lands to which his
	message may reach. It is not necessary that Prophets be sent to
	every separate habitation and to every separate community. Second,
	no new Prophet needs to be sent as long as the message and teaching
	and guidance given by a previous Prophet remains safe and intact. It
	is not necessary that a separate Prophet be sent for every race and

	is meant to impress that in the universe created by Allah nowhere is
	there homogeneity and uniformity; there is variety everywhere. From
	the same earth and by the same water different kinds of trees are
	appearing. Even the two pieces of the fruit of the same tree are not
	uniform in color and size and taste. In the same mountain one will
	see a variety of colors and a great difference in the material
	composition of its different parts. Even among human beings and
	animals one will not see two offspring of the same parents exactly
	alike. If a person seeks uniformity of the temperaments and
	dispositions and mentalities in this universe and is bewildered at
	the differences which have been alluded to in vv. 19-22 above, it
	will be his own perception and understanding to blame. This same
	variety and difference, in fact, point to the reality that this
	universe has been created by a Wise Being with great wisdom; its
	Maker is a Unique Creator and a Matchless Fashioner, Who does not
	have the same model of everything before Him, but has a variety of
	countless and limitless designs of everything. Then if one ponders
	over the differences in human temperaments and minds, in particular.
	one will see that it is not a mere accident, but in fact the
	masterpiece of the wisdom of creation. If all human beings had been
	created with the uniform temperaments and desires and feelings and
	inclinations and ways of thinking, and no room had been left for any
	difference, it would have been absolutely useless to bring about a
	new creation like man in the world. When the Creator decided to
	bring into existence a responsible creation, a creation having power
	and authority, the necessary inevitable demand of the nature of the
	decision was that room for all sorts of differences should be
	provided in its nature and structure. This is the main proof of the
	fact that the creation of man is not the result of an accident, but
	the result of a wonderful and wise plan and design. And obviously,
	wherever there is a wise plan and design, there must necessarily be
	a Wise Being working behind it, for the existence of wisdom without
	a Wise Being would be un-imaginable.</P>

	His vengeance and His omnipotence and His other attributes, the more
	he will fear His disobedience. Thus, in fact, &brvbar;knowledge&quot;
	in this verse does not imply knowledge of academic subjects like
	philosophy and science and history and mathematics, etc. but the
	knowledge of Divine attributes, no matter whether one is literate or

	regards this knowledge even if he has All the knowledge of the

	his heart, is learned even if he is illiterate. In the same

	does not imply the scholars in the technical sense, who are termed
	as religious scholars because of their knowledge of the Qur'an and
	Hadith and Fiqh and philosophy. They will prove true to this verse

	has been said by Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, thus: &quot;knowledge
	is not due to much narration of Hadith but due to much fear of

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) Those
	unjust to themselves: They are those who believe sincerely and
	honestly that the Qur'an is the . Book of Allah and Muhammad (upon
	whom be Allah's peace) the Messenger of Allah, but in practical life
	do not fully follow the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His
	Messenger. They are believers but sinful; culprits but not
	rebellious; weak of faith but not hypocritical and unbelieving at
	heart. Therefore, although they are &brvbar;unjust to themselves,&quot;
	they have been included among the chosen servants of God and among
	the heirs to the Book; otherwise, obviously the rebels and the
	hypocrites and the unbelieving people could not be so treated and
	honored. This class of the believers have been mentioned first of
	All because they are most numerous among the Muslims. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) Those
	following the middle course: They are the people who fulfill the
	obligations of this inheritance to some extent but not fully. They
	are obedient as well as erring. They have not left their self
	altogether free but try as best as they can to turn it to God's
	obedience; however, at times they give it undue freedom and become
	involved in sin. Thus, their life becomes a combination of both the
	good and the evil actions. They are less numerous than the first
	group but more than the third; that is why they have been mentioned
	second. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) Those
	excelling in good deeds: They are the people of the first rank among
	the heirs to the Book, and they are the ones who are doing full
	justice to the inheritance. They are in the forefront in following
	and adhering to the Book and the Sunnah; in conveying the message of
	God to His servants, in offering the sacrifices for the sake of the
	true Faith, and in every pious and good work. They arc not the ones
	who would commit a sin deliberately, but if they happened to commit
	a sin inadvertently, they would be filled with remorse as soon as
	they became conscious of it. They are less numerous than the people
	of the first two groups, and therefore, have been mentioned last,
	although they merit the first place in the matter of doing justice
	to the heritage of the Book of Allah

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the sentence, &quot;this is the supreme bounty', if it is related

	the supreme bounty, and the people who excel in good deeds are the
	best of the Muslim community. And if it is taken to be related with
	the first sentence, it would mean that to be a heir to the Book of
	Allah and to be chosen for this heritage is the supreme bounty, and
	the people who have been so chosen on account of their faith in the
	Qur'an and the Holy Prophet Muhammad arc the best among the human
	beings created by Allah.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote57sym" HREF="#sdfootnote57anc">57</A>One
	section of the commentators has held the view that this sentence is
	related with the two sentences immediately preceding it. That is,
	the ones who excel in good duds are the best of the people and they
	alone will enter the Gardens. As for the first two groups, nothing
	has been stated about them so that they became worried concerning
	their fate and try to improve their lot. This view has been
	presented by `Allama Zamakhshari forcefully and supported by Imam
	Razi. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But the
	majority of the commentators opine that it is related with the whole
	preceding discourse, which means that all the three classes of the
	Ummah shall eventually enter Paradise, whether without
	accountability, or afar the accountability, whether remaining secure
	from every punishment, or after receiving some punishment. This
	commentary is supported by the Qur'anic context, for a little below
	about those who are contrasted with the heirs of the Book, it has
	been said: &quot;And for those who have disbelieved, there is the
	fire of Hell. &quot; This shows that there is Paradise for all those
	who have believed in the Hook, and Hell for all those who have
	refused to believe in it. The same has been supported by the Hadith
	of the Holy Prophet, which Imam Ahmad, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim,
	Tabarani, Baihaqi and some other traditionalists have related on the
	authority of Hadrat Abu ad-Darda'. The Holy Prophet said: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Those who
	have excelled in good works shall enter Paradise without; and those
	who arc following the middle course, shall be subjected to
	accountability; but their accountability shall be light. As for
	those who have been unjust to themselves, they shall be detained
	throughout the long period of Resurrection and accountability
	(mahshar). Then Allah shall cover them also with His mercy. And they
	are the ones who will say: 'Thanks to Allah Who has removed sorrow
	from us!'&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	Hadith the Holy Prophet has himself given a complete commentary of
	the verse under discussion, and stated separately the end to be met
	by each of the three groups of the believers. The &quot;light
	accountability&quot; for the ones following the middle course means
	this: The disbelievers will be punished for their disbelief as well
	as for each single crime and sin of theirs separately, but, contrary
	to this, the good and bad deeds of the believers who come with both
	the good and evil deeds will be judged on the whole: they will not
	be rewarded for each good deed and punished for each evil deed
	separately. As for those &quot;who will be detained throughout the
	period of Resurrection and accountability because they had been
	unjust to themselves,&quot; it means: They will not be thrown into
	Hell, but will be sentenced to be detained &quot;till the rising of
	the Court.&quot; In other words, they will be exposed to all the
	severities and rigors of the lengthy Day of Resurrection (and God
	alone knows how lengthy it will be !) till Allah Almighty will turn
	to them in His mercy and command at the rising of the Court that
	they too be admitted into Paradise. The traditionists have cited
	several sayings to the same effect from many Companions like Hadrat
	'Umar, Hadrat `Uthman, Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Hadrat 'Abdullah
	bin `Abbas, Hadrat `A`ishah, Hadrat Abu Said Khudri and Hadrat Bara
	bin 'Azib. And obviously, the Companions could not have said any
	such thing in such matters unless they had heard it from the Holy
	Prophet himself. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But from
	this one should not form the impression that `those who have been
	unjust to themselves&quot; from among the Muslims will only be
	sentenced to be detained &quot;till the rising of the Court&quot;,
	and none of them will go to Hell at all. Several crimes have been
	mentioned in the Qur'an and Hadith, whose perpetrator will go to
	Hell in spite of his faith. For instance, Allah Himself has declared
	that the believer who kills another believer willfully shall go to
	Hell. Likewise, Hell has been mentioned as the punishment of those
	people also who violate the provisions of the Divine Law of
	Inheritance. Those who devour interest even after its prohibition
	have been declared to be &quot;the dwellers of Hell.&quot; Besides
	these, some other major sins also have been mentioned in Hadith,
	whose perpetrator shall go to Hell. &nbsp;
