	was bidden to emigrate from there. And according to the Qur'an, a
	Prophet is bidden to leave his place only at that time when the
	rebellion and antagonism of his people reaches the extreme limit.
	Then their doom is sealed, for after this Allah's punishment comes
	on them either as a direct scourge from Him, or they are destroyed
	by the Prophet and his followers. And this did take place actually.
	At the occasion of the Migration, the people of Makkah regarded it

	necessities of his life, so He has also provided for this greatest

	should be pointed out in what way Allah has fulfilled this basic
	need of man. Experience of centuries has shown that mankind has
	always blundered whenever it. has chosen a way of life by itself.
	This is because Man's wisdom and intelligence are limited, and he
	cannot depend on these for the choice of the right way of life.
	Above all, one cannot say that Allah has made no arrangement for
	this basic need of man, for this will be the greatest misconception
	of Allah that He may make most elaborate arrangements for man's

	vv. 4-16, some Signs have been mentioned in succession in order to
	focus people's attention on the Creation of man himself and of the
	Earth and the. heavens. They will thus find that everything supports
	the truth of the doctrines taught by the Holy Prophet. A critical
	study of all these Signs shows that these must have been designed
	and created by an All-Wise Being, and One Being alone, and there
	could not have been any partner or associate to help Him. Let us
	consider this theme from the point of view of Man, the central
	figure in the Creation. This wonderful being who is able to speak
	with his tongue and is capable of arguing his case with it, has been
	created from an insignificant sperm - drop. Then many animals have
	been created to satisfy the necessities of his life. They provide
	food, clothing and conveyance for him and help satisfy his aesthetic
	taste as well. Then there is a remarkable system of rain water from
	the sky to produce corn crops, fruits and verdure, etc., on the
	earth to fulfill man's needs. Then there is the creation of regular
	days and nights and seasons, which are closely connected with all
	kinds of production of the earth, and also with Man's general well
	being. Then there are oceans, which help fulfill many of his
	physical and aesthetic demands and provide water ways for traffic.
	Likewise mountains have been created to provide man with many
	benefits. Then there are landmarks on the earth and stars in the
	heavens to guide travelers and navigators to the destinations. In
	short, there are innumerable Signs in the Earth and the heavens
	which are closely interconnected and are also indispensable to man's
	welfare, nay, to his very existence. All these arc clear proofs that
	only One Being has designed the whole universe and created it in
	accordance with that design. It is He Who is all the time creating
	new things to fit in that scheme, and working this wonderful
	universe that spreads from the Earth to boundless heavens. Who can
	then claim, except a foolish or obdurate person, that all this has
	come into existence by a mere accident? Or, who can say that these
	different aspects, which are working under a perfect system and are
	intimately connected with one another and are well balanced, have
	been created by different gods and are under the control of
	different guardians?&nbsp;

	words employed here to refute man-made deifies clearly indicate that
	these deities were deceased prophets, saints, martyrs and pious and

	stone or wood that &quot;They do not know at all when they shall

	objection to this version that there were no such deities in Arabia,
	this is based on the lack of knowledge of the history of the
	pre-Islamic period. It is well known that there was a large number
	of Jews and Christians living among many clans of Arabia, who used
	to invoke and worship their Prophets, saints, etc. It is also a fact
	that many gods of the mushriks of Arabia were human beings, whose
	idols they had set up for worship after their death. According to a
	Tradition cited in Bukhari on the authority of Ibn ' Abbas, &quot;Wadd,
	Sua`, Yaghuth, Ya`uq, and Nasr were pious human beings, whom the
	succeeding generations had made gods.&quot; In another Tradition,
	related by Hadrat 'A'ishah, Asaf and Na'ilah were human beings.
	There are also traditions to the same effect about Lat, Munat and
	'Uzza. So much so that according to some traditions of the mushriks,

	verse (28) and verse 32, and several other verses in the Qur'an,
	clearly and definitely assert that immediately after death, souls
	suffer torment or enjoy peace in the world of Barzakh. The
	Traditions use the word &quot;qabar&quot; (grave) metaphorically for
	this existence of the souls. This is the world in which souls enter
	immediately after death and will remain therein up to the Day of
	Resurrection. Yet the disbelievers of the Traditions declare that
	after death souls will remain in a dormant state up to the time of
	Resurrection, and will neither feel any pain nor joy, nor will be
	conscious of anything at all. Obviously, this is a wrong opinion,
	for according to v. 28, just after death when the disbelievers will
	be conscious of the fact that they had been leading an evil life,
	they will try to make the angels believe that they had not done any
	evil deed. The angels will rebuke them at this &quot;boldness&quot;
	and will tell them that they shall have to go into Hell. On the
	other hand, according to verse 32, just after their death, the pious
	believers are welcomed by the angels and given the good news that
	they will enter into Paradise. Besides these verses, there is the
	mention of a dialogue between the angels and those Muslims, who did
	not migrate to Al-Madinah, after their souls were seized by the
	angels in IV: 97. Above all, according to XL: 45-46, the people of
	Pharaoh have been encircled by a torment and are exposed before the
	Fire of Hell every morning and every evening. This will go on up to
	the Day of Resurrection when they shall be sentenced to eternal
	torment.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In fact,
	both the Qur'an and the Traditions present the same kind of picture
	of the condition of the soul after death up to Resurrection. Death
	causes merely the separation of the soul from the body but does not
	annihilate it. The soul lives with the same personality that was
	formed by the different experiences and the mental exercises and
	moral activities it had in its worldly life in co-operation with the
	body. This nature of the consciousness, feelings, observations and
	experiences of the soul, during the waiting period, is similar to
	that, in a dream. Just as a criminal sentenced to death suffers from
	mental torture on the eve of his crucifixion, in the same way the
	angels take to task the guilty as in a dream, torture it and take it
	to the horrible Hell in order to make it fore-taste the impending
	torture. In contrast to this, the pure soul is welcomed by the
	angels and is given the good news of entry into paradise and is made
	to enjoy its pleasant breeze and smell, and to feel happy like the
	faithful servant who is invited to the headquarters to receive his
	reward. But this &quot;life&quot; in the world of Barzakh will
	suddenly come to an end on the second blowing of the Trumpet of
	Resurrection. When the guilty souls will again enter into their
	former bodies and muster in the Plain, they will cry in horror, &quot;Oh!
	woe to us! who has roused us from our sleeping places ?&quot; But
	the true Believers will say with perfect peace of mind, &quot;This
	is exactly what the Beneficent had predicted, and the Messengers had
	told the truth.&quot; (XXXVI: 52).</P>

	that the Book should be Brought by a perfect man, who should present
	it piece by piece, explain its meaning, remove the difficulties and
	doubts, answer objections, etc. , and above all, he should show
	towards those who rejected and opposed it that kind of attitude
	which is worthy of the bearer of this Book. On the other hand, he
	should guide those who believed in it in every aspect of life and
	set before them his own excellent pattern of life. Then he should
	train them individually and collectively on the principles of the
	Book; so as to make them a model society for the rest of mankind.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Let us
	now consider this verse (43) from another point of view. Just as it
	cuts at the root of the argumentation of those who rejected the
	Creed that a human Prophet could bring the Book, in the same way, it
	repudiates the view of those who plead that the Book should be
	accepted without any exposition of it from the Prophet. This latter
	view is contradictory to this verse, whatever be the position taken
	by its exponents. They might either be of the opinion that (a) the
	Prophet did not give any explanation of the Book he presented or
	that (b) the only acceptable thing is the Book and not any
	&quot;Exposition&quot; thereof by the Prophet, or that (c) now the
	Book alone suffices us, for its &quot;Exposition&quot; by the
	Prophet has lost its utility or that (d) now the Book alone is
	authentic for the &quot;Exposition&quot; by the Prophet has ceased
	to exist, or if it does exists, it cannot be relied upon.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If they
	take the position (a), it will mean that the Prophet did not fulfill
	the purpose for which he was chosen to be the bearer of the Book:
	otherwise Allah could send it through an angel or directly to each
	person. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If they
	take the position (b) or (c), (God forbid) they will be accusing
	Allah of doing a useless thing by sending His Book through a
	Prophet, when He could have printed copies of the Qur'an and sent
	those directly to the people.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In case,
	they take the position (d), they, in fact, repudiate both the Qur'an
	and its &quot;Exposition by the Holy Prophet. Then the only rational
	course left for them would be to accept the view of those who
	believe in the necessity of a new Prophet and a new revelation;
	whereas Allah Himself considers the &quot;Exposition&quot; of the
	Book by the Prophet as an essential thing, and puts it forward as an
	argument for the necessity of a Prophet. Now if the view of the
	rejectors of Tradition that the Explanation of the Holy Prophet has
	disappeared from the world is to be accepted, then two conclusions
	are inevitable; First, the Prophethood of Muhammad (May Allah's
	peace be upon him) as a pattern for us has ceased to exist, and the
	only relation we have with him is the same that we have with the
	other former Prophets, e.g. Hud, Salih, Shu`aib, etc. (May Allah's
	peace be upon them). That is, we have only to testify that they were
	Prophets but we have no obligation to follow their patterns, for we
	have none with us. This position obviously leads to the need of a
	new Prophet, for it automatically refutes the doctrine of the
	Finality of Prophethood. The second inevitable conclusion will be
	that a new Book is needed because in that case the Qur'an alone
	could not, according to its author, suffice. Thus in the face of
	this verse, there is no argument left to prove that the Qur'an is
	self-sufficient to explain itself, for it itself says that there is
	no need of a Prophet to explain it. Thus it is absolutely necessary
	that a new Book must be sent down. May Allah destroy such people !
	In their enthusiasm to repudiate Tradition, they are really cutting
	at the very root of Islam itself.</P>

	the Revelation towards His Prophets in particular. Allah sends His
	&quot;wahi &quot; to the heavens with His Command and they begin
	functioning in accordance with it (XL: 12). He will send this to the
	Earth with His Command and it will relate the story of all that had

	work instinctively (v. 68). The same is true of the bird that learns
	to fly, the fish that learns to swim, the newly born child that
	learns to suck milk, etc., etc. Then, it is also wahi with which

	passage (vv. 48-69) contains proofs of Tauhid and Life-after death.
	These were necessitated, for the disbelievers and .he mushriks were
	bitterly opposed to the Holy Prophet mainly because of these two
	doctrines. The acceptance of the first doctrine demolished the whole
	system of life based on shirk or atheism because to acknowledge
	Allah to be the sole Providence, the Helper and the protector left
	no room for the worship of any god or goddess. The proof of Tauhid
	is based on the observance of the structure of the cattle, the bees,
	the date-palms and vine-yards and their usefulness to mankind.
	Naturally the question arises: Who has designed these in the manner
	and for the purpose they have been created? The only obvious answer
	is that it is the All-Wise and All-Beneficent Allah Who has designed
	all these things for the benefit of mankind to produce such
	varieties of food that are so wholesome and so tasty. The Prophet,
	therefore, rightly demanded, &quot;When you yourselves admit, and
	you cannot but admit, that it is Allah alone Who has provided milk,
	honey, dates, grapes and the like, He and none but He is worthy of
	your worship, praise, gratitude and allegiance. Why do you then
	insist on making offerings to your self-made gods and goddesses?&quot;</P>

	that there is surely the Life-after-death. They were against this

	were not prepared to change their immoral ways. Their objection was

	will be worthwhile to give deep thought to the meanings of this
	verse, for some modern commentators of the Qur'an have founded
	strange economic theories and systems on it. Their interpretation is
	an instance of perverting the meaning of the Qur'an by isolating
	verses from their context and treating it as a separate whole in
	order to formulate a new philosophy and law of Islamic Economics. In
	their opinion the verse implies this: Those people to whom Allah has
	given more provisions than others, should share these equally with
	their servants and slaves: otherwise they shall be guilty of
	ingratitude to Allah in regard to the wealth with which He had
	blessed them. This commentary on the verse is obviously wrong and
	far-fetched because in the context it occurs there is no mention at
	all of any law of economics. The whole passage in which this verse
	occurs deals with the refutation of shirk and proof of Tauhid. The
	same themes are continued in the subsequent verses. There seems to
	be no reason why an economic law should have been inserted here,
	which would have been absolutely irrelevant, to say the least. On
	the contrary, when the verse is considered in its context, it
	becomes quite obvious that it is no more than the statement of a
	fact to prove the same theme that is contained in this passage. It
	argues like this: &quot;When you yourselves do not make your
	servants and slaves equal partners in your wealth-which in fact is
	given to you by Allah-how is it that you join other gods with God in
	your gratitude to Him for the favors with which He has blessed you.
	You know that these gods have no powers to bestow anything on
	anyone, and, therefore, have no right in your worship of Allah, for
	they are after all His slaves and servants.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	interpretation of the verse under discussion is corroborated by XXX:
	28: &quot;Allah sets forth to you an instance from your own selves:
	Do your slaves share with you the wealth We have bestowed on you so
	that you and they become equals in this? And do you fear them as you
	fear one another? Thus We make clear Our Signs to those who use
	their common sense.&quot; A comparison of the two verses makes it
	quite clear that these have been cited to bring home to the mushriks
	that they themselves do not associate their slaves with themselves
	in their wealth and status, but they have the impudence and folly to
	set up His own creature as partner with God.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It
	appears that the erroneous interpretation has been strengthened by
	the succeeding sentence: &quot;What! do they then deny to
	acknowledge Allah's favor? As this sentence immediately follows the
	similitude of the rich people and their slaves, they conclude that
	it will be ingratitude on the part of those, who possess more wealth
	not to share it equally with those who have less. As a matter of
	fact, everyone who has studied the Qur'an critically knows that
	ingratitude to Allah is to show gratitude to others than Allah for
	His blessings. This interpretation is so patently wrong that those
	who are well-versed in the teachings of the Qur'an can have no
	misconception about it. And such verses as these can mislead only
	those who have a cursory knowledge of the Qur'an.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now that
	the significance of the ingratitude towards Allah's blessing has
	become plain, the meaning of the verse will be quite clear, and it
	is this: &quot;When the Mushriks understand the implication of the
	difference between the master and his slave and observe this
	distinction in their own lives, why do they then persist in ignoring
	the immense difference between the Creator and His creatures and set
	up the latter as His partners and pay homage of gratitude to them
	for the blessings bestowed on them by Allah.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote89sym" HREF="#sdfootnote89anc">88</A>In
	this brief sentence Allah has enjoined three most important things
	on which alone depends the establishment of a sound and healthy
	society:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The first
	of these is justice which has two aspects.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">To make
	such arrangements as may enable everyone to get one's due rights
	without stint. Justice does not, however, mean equal distribution of
	rights, for that would be absolutely unnatural. In fact, justice
	means equitable dispensation of rights which in certain cases may
	mean equality. For example, all citizens should have equal rights of
	citizenship but in other cases equality in rights would be
	injustice. For instance, equality in social status and rights
	between parents and their children will obviously be wrong. Likewise
	those who render services of superior and inferior types cannot be
	equal in regard to wages and salaries. What Allah enjoins is that
	the full rights of everyone should be honestly rendered whether
	those be moral, social, economic legal or political in accordance
	with what one justly deserves.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second thing enjoined is &quot;ihsan&quot; which has no equivalent
	in English. This means to be good, generous, sympathetic, tolerant,
	forgiving, polite, cooperative, selfless, etc. In collective life
	this is even more important than justice; for justice is the
	foundation of a sound society but ihsan is its perfection. On the
	one hand, justice protects society from bitterness and violation of
	rights: on the other, ihsan makes it sweet and joyful and worth
	living. It is obvious that no society can flourish if every
	individual insists on exacting his pound of flesh. At best such a
	society might be free from conflict but there cannot be love,
	gratitude, generosity, sacrifice, sincerity, sympathy and such
	humane qualities as produce sweetness in life and develop high
	values.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	thing which has been enjoined is good treatment towards one's
	relatives which in fact is a specific form of ihsan. It means that
	one should not only treat one's relatives well, share their sorrows
	and pleasures and help them within lawful limits but should also
	share one's wealth with them according to one's means and the need
	of each relative. This enjoins on everyone who possesses ample means
	to acknowledge the share of one's deserving relatives along with the
	rights of one's own person and family. The Divine Law holds every
	well-to-do person in a family to be responsible for fulfilling the
	needs of all his needy kith and kin. The Law considers it a great
	evil that one person should enjoy the pleasures of life while his
	own kith and kin are starving. As it considers the family to be an
	important part of society, it lays down that the first right of
	needy individuals is on its well-to-do members and then on the
	others. Likewise it is the first duty of the well-to-do members of
	the family to fulfill the needs of their own near relatives and then
	those of others. The Holy Prophet has emphasized this fact in many
	Traditions, according to which a person owes rights to his parents,
	his wife and children, his brothers and sisters, other relatives,
	etc., in accordance with the nearness of their relationships. On the
	basis of this fundamental principle, Caliph Umar made it obligatory
	on the first cousins of an orphan to support him. In the case of
	another orphan he declared that if he had no first cousins he would
	have made it obligatory on distant cousins to support him. Just
	imagine the happy condition of the society every unit of which
	supports its every needy individual in this way-most surely that
	society will become high and pure economically, socially, and
	morally.</P>

	this connection it should be noted that Allah has rebuked the people
	for the worst form of violation of treaties which has been creating
	the greatest disorder in the world. It is a pity that even &quot;big&quot;
	people consider it to be a virtue to violate treaties in order to
	gain advantages for their people in political, economic and
	religious conflicts. At one time the leader of one nation enters
	into a treaty with another nation for the interest of his own people
	but at another time the same leader publicly breaks the very same
	treaty for the interest of his people, or secretly violates it. It
	is an irony that such violations are made even by those people who
	are honest in their private lives. Moreover, it is regrettable that
	their own people do not protest against them; nay, they eulogize
	them for such shameful feats of diplomacy. Therefore, Allah warns
	that every such treaty is a test of the character of those who enter
	into it, and of their nations. They might gain some apparent
	advantage for their people in this way, but they will not escape
	their consequences on the Day of Judgment.

	is to warn that decision about differences and disputes that lead to
	conflict, will be made on the Day of Judgment. Therefore, these
	should not be made an excuse to break agreements and treaties. Even
	if one is wholly in the right and the opponent is wholly in the
	wrong, it is not right for the former to break treaties or make
	false propaganda or employ other deceitful methods to defeat the
	other. If one does so, it will go against him on that Day because
	righteousness demands that one should not only be right in one's
	theories and aims but should also use right methods and employ right
	means. This warning has especially been given to those religious
	groups and sects who always suffer from this misunderstanding that
	they have a right to defeat their opponents because they are on the
	side of God and their opponents are rebels against Allah: therefore,
	there is no obligation on them to stick to their treaties with their
	opponents. This was what the Arab Jews practiced, declaring, &quot;There

	the use of every sort of method and means irrespective of whether
	they are right or wrong to propagate his own religion (considering
	it to be Allah's Religion) and try to destroy opposite religions.
	For this would be utterly against the will of Allah: if Allah had
	willed that there should be no religious differences, He could have
	deprived mankind of the freedom of choice. In that case, there would
	have been no need for Allah to get help of any such up-holder of His
	Religion, who uses disgraceful means for this purpose. Allah could
	have created all mankind to be inherent believers and obedient
	servants by depriving them of the power and option of disbelief and

	Afterwards when he came crying to the Holy Prophet, he said, &quot;O
	Messenger of Allah, they did not let me go until I spoke evil of you
	and praised their deities&quot; . The Holy Prophet asked him, &quot;How

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) There

	Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) was commanded to follow
	the way of Abraham and not the way of the Jews, and they themselves
	knew than these things were not unlawful in the law of Abraham. For
	instance, the Jews did not eat the flesh of camel but this was
	lawful according to Abraham. Likewise, ostrich, hare, duck, etc.,
	were unlawful in the Jewish law, but they were lawful according to
	Abraham. Incidentally the disbelievers of Makkah have been warned
	that neither they nor the Jews had any relationship with Prophet
	Abraham for he was not a mushrik while both of them were practicing

	admonition&quot; implies two things: (1) One should not be content
	with convincing the addressee with arguments alone but should also
	appeal to his feelings. Likewise one should not confine oneself
	merely to arguments in condemning evils and deviations but should
	try to convince the other of their repugnance that lies embedded in
	the human nature. One should also warn of the worst consequences of
	those evils. Besides, one should not only try to convince the
	addressee rationally of the soundness and excellence of guidance and
	righteous deeds but should also create in him interest and love for
	them. (2) Admonition should be administered in such a manner as to
	show sincere concern for and the welfare of the addressee. Nothing
	should be said or done to create the impression that the admonisher
	is looking down upon him and taking pleasure in his own feeling of
	superiority. On the contrary, he should feel that the admonisher is
	filled with the strong desire for his reform and welfare.</P>

	manner&quot; implies that one should have a sweet tongue, show noble
	character and give reasonable and appealing arguments, and refrain
	from indulging in polemics, argumentation and controversies. The one
	who discusses things with people in the best manner, does not resort
	to accusations, crooked arguments, taunts, nor makes fun of the
	opponent in order to defeat him and to win applause for his own
	superiority in argument. For these things will produce obduracy and
	obstinacy. In contrast to this, he will try to convince the other in
	a simple and humble way, and when he feels that the other person has
	come down to crooked arguments, he will leave him alone lest the
	other should go further and further astray in his deviation.</P>
