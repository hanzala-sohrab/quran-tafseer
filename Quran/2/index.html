							in the law which was revealed by Allah to their Prophet Moses
							(Allah's peace be upon him), and in principle, their way was the
							same (Islam) that was being taught by Prophet Muhammad (Allah's
							peace be upon him). But they had strayed away from it during the
							centuries of degeneration and had adopted many un-Islamic creeds,
							rites and customs of which there was no mention and for which there
							was no sanction in the Torah. Not only this : they had tampered with
							the Torah by inserting their own explanations and interpretations
							into its text. They had distorted even that part of the Word of God
							which had remained intact in their Scriptures and taken out of it
							the real spirit of true religion and were now clinging to a lifeless
							frame of rituals. Consequently their beliefs, their morals and their
							conduct had gone to the lowest depths of degeneration. The pity is
							that they were not only satisfied with their condition but loved to
							cling to it. Besides this, they had no intention or inclination to
							accept any kind of reform. So they became bitter enemies of those
							who came to teach them the Right Way and did their worst to defeat
							every such effort. Though they were originally Muslims, they had
							swerved from the real Islam and made innovations and alterations in
							it and had fallen victims to hair splitting and sectarianism. They
							had forgotten and forsaken Allah and begun to serve mammon. So much
							so that they had even given up their original name &quot;Muslim&quot;
							and adopted the name &quot;Jew&quot; instead, and made religion the
							sole monopoly of the children of Israel. </FONT>

			for you because you are doomed for ever: you must bear the
			consequences of what you have done in the past. In contrast to this,

			not on account of the natural result of your virtue, but it is
			through Allah's grace. He has full power to reward it or not. In the

			inevitable consequences of the sin but because Allah has full power
			to punish or pardon it. Of course, being All-Wise, He does not use
			these powers indiscriminately, but takes into consideration the
			intention of the doer. If He rewards a virtue, He does so when He
			sees that His servant performed the good deeds to please Him. And if
			He rejects an apparent virtue, He does so because He knows that it
			lacked sincerity. In the same way, He punishes the crime which is

			means the servant of Allah. This was the title that Allah had
			bestowed upon Jacob, who was a son of Isaac, and a grandson of
			Abraham (Allah's peace be upon them all ). His descendents are
			called children of Israel. Up to verse 39, it was an introductory
			discourse meant for all mankind. From verse 40 to verse 121 is a new
			discourse in which the children of Israel have been especially and
			particularly addressed. In some places it has also been directed
			towards the Christians and the mushriks of Arabia and in between
			towards the people who believed in the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom
			be Allah's peace and blessings). In order to understand the full
			significance of this address, the following should be kept in view.
			First, it aims to appeal to those few followers of the former
			Prophets, who were still capable of reforming themselves to believe
			in the Truth which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had brought
			and to cooperate with the mission which he had been appointed to
			perform. They are, therefore, told that the message of the Qur'an is
			the same as of the Scriptures of the former Prophets, and the
			mission of the Holy Prophet also was the same as theirs. It means to
			say: &quot;At tirst this mission was entrusted to you so that you
			may put the Message into practice and then invite the world to
			accept it. But, not to speak of carrying out the mission, you
			discarded the Guidance and went on degenerating. The past history of
			your community and its present moral and religious degeneration are
			a standing witness against you. Now Allah has sent another Servant
			of His with the same Message and mission and there is nothing new or
			strange in this for you. You should not, therefore, oppose the Truth
			knowingly. The best thing for you is to accept it and cooperate with
			those who are doing the same work that was once entrusted to you.&quot;
			Secondly, it aims to argue the Jews out of their wrong position and
			to expose their moral and religious degeneration thoroughly.
			Therefore, it proves conclusively that their attitude towards Islam
			was absolutely wrong; for they were opposing it, whereas they knew
			that its fundamentals were exactly the same as of their religion and
			that there was nothing in the teachings of the Qur'an that was
			different from or opposed to the teachings of the Torah in
			principle. It also shows that they had utterly failed to follow the
			Guidance which was given to them and fulfil the obligations of the
			leadership entrusted to them. As a proof thereof, such incidents
			have been cited as they could not deny. Moreover, this address
			unravelled the plots they were hatching, the doubts they were
			arousing, the crooked arguments they were advancing and the evil
			machinations they were contriving to defeat the mission of the Holy
			Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings), though
			they knew it to be from Allah. This also exposed their &quot;piety&quot;,
			for it lacked sincerity and righteousness and was motivated by
			obduracy, prejudice and self-worship. It also proved beyond any
			shadow of doubt that they did not really want virtue to thrive. This
			produced the desired effect: it opened the eyes of the righteous
			element among the Jews and put an end to the spiritual and moral
			superiority they enjoyed against the common and polytheistic Arabs
			of Madinah. Besides, when they themselves were once exposed, they
			were so dismayed that they dared not oppose Islam openly with the
			courage of conviction. Thirdly, in the preceding verses, mankind had
			been invited to accept the Guidance of Allah. Now the example of the
			Israelites is being cited to show the consequences of discarding
			that Guidance. The reason why the Israelites have been held out as
			an example is that they are the only community whose history during
			the last four thousand years has been a living object lesson for all
			the nations of the world. In its history one can see all the ups and
			downs which result from following the Divine Guidance or from
			discarding it. Fourthly, though the appeal is addressed to the Jews,
			it is also meant to forewarn the Muslims against the pitfalls of
			degeneration into which the followers of the former Prophets had
			fallen. That is why, on the one hand, the moral weaknesses of the
			Jews, their wrong notions about religion, their wrong ways of
			thinking and living, have been pointed out, one by one, while, on
			the other, the demands of the true faith have been stated so that
			the Muslims are able to see the Right Way clearly and avoid wrong.
			ways. The Holy Prophet knew by Divine inspiration that, by and by,
			the Muslims also would follow the same ways that had been pointed
			out in this discourse. Therefore, according to a Tradition, he
			forewarned that they would discard the Guidance and follow, step by
			step, the communities of the former Prophets, that is, the Jews and
			the Christians, in their wrong ways. It is a pity that they have not
			paid any heed to this warning and adopted the same ways of
			degeneration.

			overawed by the scholarship of the Jews, more so because their
			scholars and rabbis made a great show of their learning and piety
			and reinforced it with the practice of charms and amulets. The
			people of Madinah in particular were overawed by the learning of the
			Jews, for they were surrounded by big Jewish tribes and came in

			religious in character. <BR>Such were the conditions when the Holy
			Prophet upon whom be peace) presented himself as a Prophet and began

			to the Jews for guidance in this matter, and said: &quot;You are the
			followers of a Prophet and possess a Book, so tell us what you think
			of this man and his teachings, who claims to be a Prophet.&quot;
			This question was repeatedly asked of the Jews by the people of
			Makkah, and when the Holy Prophet came to Madinah, here also many
			people visited the Jewish scholars again and again to ask them the
			same question. But their scholars never gave them the right answer.
			For they could not say that the doctrine of Tauhid that Muhammad
			(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) was preaching was wrong,
			nor that the knowledge which he imparted about the Prophets,
			scriptures, angels, and the Hereafter was wrong, nor that there was
			something wrong about the moral principles that he taught. They were
			neither ready to admit in plain words the righteousness of the
			teachings of the Holy Prophet; nor had they the courage to refute it
			openly; nor were they willing to profess the Truth candidly.
			Instead, they devised a subtle strategy to oppose it: they created
			one suspicion or the other about the Holy Prophet, his followers and
			his mission; they would concoct allegations against him and his
			followers and make false propaganda against them or raise frivolous
			objections so as to involve them in useless discussions. That is why
			they have been warned not to conceal the truth by covering it with

				HREF="#sdfootnote79anc">79</A>The
			history of the Israelites abounds in instances of the persecution of
			their own Prophets. We cite here a few from the Bible: (1) After the
			death of the Prophet Solomon, the kingdom of the Israelites was
			split into two states the kingdom of Judah with its capital at
			Jerusalem, and the kingdom of Israel with its capital at Samaria. As
			the two were often at war with each other, the things came to such a
			pass that the kingdom of Judah asked for help from the Aramaic
			kingdom of Damascus against their own brethren. At this the Prophet
			Hanani by God's command severely rebuked Asa king of Judah for
			relying on the king of Syria instead of relying on &quot;the Eternal
			your God.&quot; But Asa instead of heeding the warning sent the
			Prophet of God to the prison house. (2 Chronicles, 16: 1-10). (2)
			When the Prophet Elijah rebuked the Israelites for serving and
			worshipping Baal, and asked them to serve and worship One God alone,
			they became his mortal enemies. King Ahab of Samaria threatened to
			kill him because his idolatrous wife incited him against the Prophet
			Elijah. In terror he ran for his life to the mountains in the Sinai
			Peninsula. During the period of affliction, he said, &quot;I have
			been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts: for the children of
			Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain
			thy prophets with the sword; and I, even 1 only, am left; and they
			seek my life, to take it away&quot;. (1 Kings, 19: 1-10). (3) King
			Ahab sent another Prophet, Micaiah, to prison for speaking out the
			truth. &quot;And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry
			him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
			son; and say, &quot;Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the
			prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
			affliction, until I come in peace.&quot; (1 Kings, 22: 26-27). (4)
			When the people of Judah began to worship idols openly and to do
			what was evil in the sight of Allah, the Prophet Zecharia raised his
			voice against these evils, saying: &quot;Why transgress ye the
			commandments of the Lord, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have
			forsaken the Lord, he hath also forsaken you. And they conspired
			against him, and stoned him at the commandment of the king in the
			court of the house of the Lord. &quot; (2 Chronicles, 24: 20-21) (5)
			When the Israelite state of Samaria was destroyed by the Assyrians,
			and the Jewish state at Jerusalem was threatened with imminent
			danger, the Prophet Jeremiah began to bewail and warn his people of
			their degeneration and its evil consequences. He lamented and cried,
			&quot;Mend your ways otherwise you will meet with a far worse doom
			than Samaria.&quot; In answer to this the Jews cursed him, beat him
			and imprisoned him. They accused him of treachery against the nation
			and shouted, &quot;You are deserting to the Chaldeans.&quot; He was
			arrested and flogged and confined in the dungeon cells. Then they
			put him into an underground cistern, lowering him down with ropes so
			that he should sink in the mud and die on the spot from starvation.
			(For details please refer to Jeremiah, I5: 10, 18: 20-23; 20:1-18
			and Chapters 36 to 40.) (6) About the Prophet Amos, it is written
			that when he rebuked the Israelite state of Samaria for its evil and
			immoral doings and warned them of their evil are doing. These are
			the people who have preferred the worldly life to the life in the
			Hereafter. Therefore their torment shall not be lightened nor shall
			help be given to them (from any quarter). consequences, he was
			served with the notice:&quot;O thou seer, go, flee thee away into
			the land of Judah and prophesy there.&quot; (Amos, 7: 10-13). (7)
			When John the Baptist raised his voice against the immoralities
			which were being openly practised in the court of Herod, king of
			Judah, he was arrested and bound in prison. Then at the request of
			Herodias, his wife, who had a grudge against him, he sent one of the
			guards to bring his head. The man went and beheaded him in the
			prison and brought, his head on a dish to be presented to her. Thus,
			the Prophet of God was killed without any cause. (ark, 6: 17-29.)
			(8) The last victim of the evil designs of the high priests and the
			elders of the jews was Jesus Christ, who took them to task for their
			sins and hypocrisies and advised them to lead a righteous life. For
			this&quot;crime&quot; of his, they plotted against him: bought
			Judas, one of his twelve disciples, and sent a large mob with swords
			and cudgels to seize him and take him away to the house of the high
			priest. After binding him, they led him off, and handed him over to
			Pontius Pilate, the Roman Governor. They tried to procure false
			evidence against him in order to have him put to death. They had
			become so hardhearted that they asked Pilate to release Barabbas, a
			murderer, as a boon at the festival but to &quot;crucify him&quot; .
			In this verse, the Qur'an briefly refers to this most shameful
			chapter of the history of the Israelites and declares that they
			fully deserved the curses and condemnation of Allah. They chose
			their worst offenders against law and morality and made them their
			chiefs and leaders, and sent their most pious and righteous men to
			the gaol or the gallows.

			struck at the root of family life which is the very foundation of

			because they cut at the root of those relations on which depended
			their own solidarity and that of their society. A Tradition of the
			Holy Prophet says that Satan sends his agents to the tour corners of
			the world. When they come back to him to report, they relate the

			following should be kept in mind
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) After
			Noah, Abraham was the first Prophet who was appointed by Allah to
			spread the universal Message of Islam. He began his mission in his
			own country, 'Iraq, and invited the people to Islam (submission to
			Allah). Then he visited Syria, Palestine, Egypt and Arabia with the
			same mission. Afterwards he appointed his deputies in different
			places. He deputed Lot, his nephew, to Trans-Jordan, Isaac, his son,
			to Syria and Palestine, and Ismail, the elder son, to Arabia. Then
			he was commanded by Allah to build at Makkah that house of worship
			which is called the Ka'bah and to make it the centre of his mission.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) From
			the two sons of the Prophet Abraham sprang two nations Isma`ilites
			and Israelites. The former were the descendants of Ishmael who
			settled in Arabia. The Quraish and some other Arab clans were his
			direct descendants but even those Arab clans which were not his
			descendants claimed to he Isma 'ilites because they were more or
			less influenced by his mission. The latter, the Israelites, were the
			descendants of Jacob, son of Isaac. Jospeh, Moses, David, Solomon,
			John, Jesus (may Allah's peace be upon them all) and many other
			Prophets rose from among them. They were called Israelites after
			Israel, the second name of Jacob. Some other people who accepted
			their religion also merged into them. All the Prophets of Israel,
			including Jesus, preached Islam, submission to Allah, but when the
			Israelites became degenerate and lost their religion (Islam) they
			invented Judaism and later Christianity.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
			Abraham was appointed to invite the world to surrender to Allah and
			to reform the people in accordance with Allah's Guidance. He himself
			surrendered and acted upon the knowledge he received from Allah and
			exerted his utmost to propagate that knowledge and to persuade all
			the people to submit to the Sovereign of the Universe. Therefore he
			was made the leader of the world. Afterwards this leadership, with
			all its responsibilities, was transferred to the Israelites, the
			descendants of Isaac and Jacob. This was the special favour which
			the Israelites were asked, over and over again, to remember.
			Accordingly, during the time of Solomon, the Holy Temple at
			Jerusalem became the centre and the qiblah (the place towards which
			face is to be turned for prayer) of all the worshippers of Allah, as
			long as the Israelites remaind the leaders of this mission.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) In
			the foregoing address (vv.40-121), Allah has charged the Israelites
			with their sins of omission and commission during their leadership.
			Therefore the Qur'an points out their moral condition and tells them
			plainly, &quot;You have proved yourselves quite unworthy of the
			favour shown to you. You have not only neglected to perform the
			obligations of leadership but have also discarded the Guidance of
			Allah from your own lives. Now the things have come to such a pass
			that you havebecome a community utterly unfit for leadership.&quot;
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) Now
			they are being told that leadership is not the privilege of the
			descendants of Abraham as such, for none has any exclusive claim to
			it by the mere accident of birth. It was bestowed only upon those
			who submitted to Allah and followed His Guidance like Abraham. As
			they have swerved from that Way, and proved utterly unworthy of
			leadership, they are deposed from it.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) It
			also implied that the non-Israelite followers of the Prophet Moses
			and Jesus, who were proud of their relationship with Abraham had
			also swerved from the way of Abraham. Similarly, the idolaters of
			Arabia, who were also proud of their relationship with Abraham and
			Ismail have been told that they too were utterly unworthy of
			leadership, for they, too, had swerved from the Way of Abraham and
			Ismail.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7 ) Now
			that the Israelites had been deposed from leadership, the argument
			proceeds to show why Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) was raised
			as a Prophet from among the descendants ofIsmail, in answer to the
			prayer of Abraham and Ismail . It is because he followed the same
			Way as was followed by Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and all the
			Prophets before him. He and his followers believed in all the
			Prophets sent by Allah, and invited the world to the same Way that
			was shown by the former Prophets. Therefore the followers of this
			Prophet alone were worthy of that leadership.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(8) With
			the transfer of leadership, it was essential to change its centre as
			well. As long as the Israelites were the leaders, the Holy Temple at
			Jerusalem was the centre and giblah of all the followers of the
			Truth. That was why the Holy Prophet and his followers also used to
			turn their faces at first towards it at prayer. But when the
			Israelites were deposed from leadership, the Holy Temple
			automatically ceased to be the giblah. It was therefore, declared
			that the Ka'bah at Makkah, where Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon
			him) started his mission, is to be the giblah in future. As it also
			was the centre of Abraham's mission, neither the Israelites nor the
			Arabs could object to it because both acknowledged Abraham as their
			Prophet and ancestor. Thus there was no reason left for them to
			raise any objection against making the Ka`bah the centre of the
			Divine mission. But the fact is that obdurate people will goon
			arguing against the Truth even after knowing it to be the Truth.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(9) After
			declaring the Muslims to be the leaders, with the Ka`bah as their
			centre, Allah gives instructions (vv. 153-286) for their guidance to
			enable them to carry out their obligations as leaders of the world.</P>

			responsibility, he was exalted to this high position. Ever since the

		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
			Judaism and Christianity were born long after the death of Abraham.
			Judaism, with its special rituals, peculiar regulations, etc., took
			its birth and name some tour hundred years before Christ. As to
			&quot;Christianity&quot;, it took its name and adopted its special
			creed and form long after the recall of Jesus. Thus it is clear that
			their claim that one must become a Jew or a Christian in order to
			obtain guidance was historically untenable. For in that case,
			Abraham, Jesus and all the other Prophets and all the good people
			who had passed away long before the birth of Judaism and
			Christianity could not be counted among the right-guided persons for
			the simple reason that these &quot;religions&quot; did not exist at
			the time they lived. Thus, it was obvious that the Jews and
			Christians could not say that these Prophets were not right-guided,
			nor could they claim that they followed Judaism or Christianity. As
			a corollary to this, true Guidance did not, even according to them,
			consist of the particular features which divided them into two
			distinct religions, but it was that eternal universal way which has
			been shown by all the Messengers of Allah and which has always been
			followed by the good people of all ages.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) It
			also meant to warn the Jews and the Christians that both practised
			shirk and had, therefore, swerved from the way of Abraham, who did
			not associate any other object with Allah in his worship, his
			reverence, his submission and his obedience to Him. They could not
			deny this because their own Scriptures bore testimony to it. &nbsp;</P>

			do not discriminate against any of them&quot; means that we believe
			in all the Prophets of Allah and reject none. It is obvious that all
			the Prophets who came from Allah brought the same Truth and invited
			the people to the same Guidance and Right Way. Hence anyone who
			follows the Truth must accept all the Prophets. Those who accept one
			Prophet and reject the other really reject even the one whom they
			profess to accept. Had they followed the universal Guidance taught
			by Moses, Jesus and other Prophets, they could not have rejected any
			other Prophet (i.e. Muhammad, Allah's peace be upon him). As a

			the baptised person were washed away and he had received a new
			colour of life. This same custom was later on adopted by the
			Christians and it was termed &quot;Baptism&quot;, which is a
			ceremonial immersion in water or an application of water as an

			not only to the new converts but also to all newly-born babies. The

			in response to an invitation. This verse was revealed when he had

			following his lead did the same. Afterwards it was announced
			publicly in Madinah and its suburbs that the giblah had been
			changed. Bara' bin Azib says that at one place this announcement was
			heard at a time when the people had bent down in the Prayer. But
			when they heard the commandment, they turned about in the same
			posture towards the Ka'bah. Anas bin Malik says that the people of
			Bani Salamah heard of the change of the qiblah next morning at a
			time when they had already gone through half of the Prayer. As soon

			that the term of the leadership of the Israelites had come to an end

		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
			Commandment &quot;Turn your face towards the Ka'abah&quot; does not
			mean that one should turn one's face exactly to the point of the
			Ka'abah from every part of the globe. Obviously it is very difficult
			for everyone to do so at all times from all places of the globe.
			That is why the Qur'an directs us to turn our faces towards the
			Ka'abah and not to the point of the Ka'abah : We should do our best
			to find out the exact direction of the Ka`abah : then if we are
			satisfied that a certain direction is most probably the correct
			direction, we should turn our faces towards it. But when it is not
			possible to ascertain the exact direction (for example, in a boat or
			a train, etc.) one should turn one's face to the probable right

			chance left for any test. Then belief and submission will have no

			to make strong propaganda and raise serious objections against the
			Believers. They ironically remarked, &quot;What a pious people they
			are! They do not hesitate to shed blood even in a prohibited month.&quot;
			Such objections have been answered in this verse which implies, &quot;No

			reason than that they believed in one Allah. They not only forced
			these brethren of their own to leave their beloved homes but also
			prevented them from paying a visit to the Ka`bah, although this
			sacred place was not the property of anyone. Their crime was all the

			cleansed. Then he should wait for the next monthly course to
			pronounce the third and final divorce after she is cleansed. It is,

		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">About
			1000 B.C., the Amalikites tyrannized over the Israelites and usurped

			in the way of God.&quot; They asked for a king to rule them like all

			influence of the irreligious foreign rulers, they had forgotten the
			very distinction between &quot;Divine Rule&quot; and &quot;kingship.&quot;
			That is why `the thing displeased Samuel' and incurred the wrath of

			Samuel.

			themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, and said unto
			him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways; now
			make us a king to judge us like all the nations .... But the thing
			displeased Samuel, when they said, &quot;Give us a king to judge
			us&quot;. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto
			Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say
			unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected
			me, that I should not reign over them ..... And Samuel told all the
			words of the Lord unto the people that asked of him of a king. And
			he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over
			you: He will take your sons and appoint them for himself, for his
			chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his
			chariots. And he will appoint them captains over thousands and
			captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to
			reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
			instruments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to be
			confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. And he will take
			your fields and your vineyards, and give them to his servants
			............................. And he will take the tenth of your
			seed, and of your vine-yard, and give to his officers and to his
			servants. And he will take your men-servants, and your

			them to his work. He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall
			be his servants. And ye shall cry out in that day because of your
			king which ye shall have chosen yourselves; and the Lord will not
			hear you in that day. Nevertheless the people refused to obey the
			voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over
			us; That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may
			judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles. And the Lord
			said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a
			king.............. (7:15, 8:4-22).

			your God was your king. Now therefore behold the king whom ye have

		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From the

			related here only for the benefit of the Muslims so that they may
			learn a lesson from this. Therefore there was no occasion for the
			condemnation or approval of the institution of kingship, and it
			would have been irrelevant to discuss whether this demand was right
			or wrong. Here the only object in view is to state the cause of the
			downfall of the Israelites, their cowardice, self-worship and lack

			Allah and make sacrifice of life and property for its establishment.
			They have also been warned to ward off those weaknesses in which the

			success does not depend merely upon numbers, provisions and

			have made life difficult for its rivals and opponents. Then it has
			been shown that Allah is not powerless to remove differences from
			among the people but it is not His Will to remove these forcibly.
			Therefore He sends His Messengers with the Truth for this purpose,
			but leaves the people free to accept or reject it. Again as in the
			beginning of this discourse, the Muslims have been enjoined to spend
			their wealth in the Way of Allah. Then in this verse it has been

		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) It
			has always been a common characteristic of all the mushrik societies
			to accept Allah as the God of gods and the Lord of lords but, at the
			same tune, to associate other gods and lords with Him, so as not to
			acknowledge Him exclusively as the Lord and God and worship Him as
			the Deity.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) They
			have always divided Godhead into two parts the supernatural Godhead
			and the sovereign Godhead. They assign to God the supernatural
			Godhead which controls every kind of cause that produces an effect:
			so they turn to Him for help in their needs and difficulties but in
			their ignorance they set up spirits, angels, jinns, stars and many
			others as partners with the Supreme God, and pray to them, worship
			them and present offerings to them at temples dedicated to them. As
			to the sovereign Godhead, which really belongs to God and entitles
			Him alone to prescribe the way of life and to demand obedience to
			His commandments and to have absolute authority over all the affairs
			of the world, the mushrikin have in every age either totally usurped
			this rank of Godhead from God and handed it over to royal families,
			priests, guides, elders of society, etc., or divided it between
			these gods and God. That is why the royal families have often
			claimed the rank of Godhead in the second sense, and in order to
			strengthen their claim, have declared themselves to be descendants
			of gods in the first sense, and the priests have always strengthened
			and supported them , in their evil designs of becoming gods.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
			Nimrod claimed to be a god possessing the rank of sovereign godhead.
			He did not deny the existence of God nor did he claim to be the
			creator of the heavens and the earth nor the sustainer and ruler of
			the universe. He only claimed to be the absolute lord and sovereign
			of `Iraq and its inhabitants. His claim was that whatever he said
			was law and there was none over him to whom he might be held
			accountable: therefore any inhabitant of 'Iraq who did not
			acknowledge him exclusively as his lord was a rebel.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
			dispute referred to arose when Abraham declared, &quot;I acknowledge
			the Lord of the universe exclusively as my Lord and God of worship
			and I disown categorically the lordship and godhead of everyone
			else.&quot; Obviously, the declaration of this creed not only struck
			at the root of the national religion and religious gods but at the

			the absolute lord of 'Iraq. That is why it was not tolerated and the
			Prophet Abraham was brought before Nimrod for trial as a rebel.

			not alone in arguing like this; the bankers and money-lenders of
			today also put forward similar arguments for charging interest. They
			argue that a person, who lends a sum of money to another, could
			himself make profit from it and that the debtor actually does invest
			it in a profitable business. Why should not the creditor then get a

			different moral and economic results is this :
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(I) The
			settlement of profit in trade between the buyer and the seller is
			made on equal terms. The buyer purchases the article he needs and
			the seller gets profit for the time, labour and brains he employs in
			providing that article to the buyer. In contrast, in the case of
			interest, the debtor cannot settle the transaction on equal terns
			with the creditor because of his weaker position. As far as the
			money lender is concerned, he gets that fixed sum of interest which
			he considers his profit. If the debtor spends the borrowed money in
			fulfilling his personal needs, the time factor definitely does not
			bring any profit at all. And if he invests that money in trade,
			commerce, industry, agriculture, etc., then there are equal chances
			of profit or loss. Thus lending money at interest might bring a
			guaranteed and fixed profit to one party and loss to the other, or a
			guaranteed and fixed profit to one party and an uncertain and
			indefinite profit to the other.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) 'The
			trader charges his profit, however high it tray be, once for all but
			the money-lender goes on charging interest over and over again and
			it goes on increasing with the passage of time. The profit which the
			debtor makes on the money of the creditor, however large it may be,
			has after all its own limits, but there is no limit to the interest
			the creditor may charge on his money. He may, as sometimes it
			actually happens, receive all the earnings of the debtor, nay, may
			even deprive him of all the means of livelihood or of the articles
			of his personal use and still might have the same amount of debt
			against him that was at the tune of borrowing.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
			transaction in trade comes to an end as soon as the article and its
			price change hands. After this the buyer is not required to return
			anything to the seller. As regards the rent of furniture, house,
			land, etc. the lent thing is not itself spent up but is returned to
			the owner after the term. But in the case of the principal the
			debtor has to spend it first and then to reproduce it and return it
			to the creditor along with its interest. Thus the debtor runs a
			double risk; he has to reproduce the principal and also to produce
			its interest.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) One
			engaged in trade, industry, agriculture, etc., earns profit by
			spending time, labour and intelligence but the money-lender becomes
			the stronger partner in the earnings of the debtor without any risk
			or labour on his part simply because he invests the money which is
			over and above his need. Ne is a partner only to the extent that he
			is entitled to a fixed guaranteed interest, irrespective of whether
			there is any profit at all or how much, or whether there is even a
			loss.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From the
			above it becomes clear that even from the economic point of view,
			trade helps construct society but interest leads to ruin. As for the
			moral point of view, interest, by its very nature, creates
			parsimony, selfishness, cruelty, hard-heartedness, money-worship,
			etc., and kills the spirit of fellow-feeling and co-operation It is,
			therefore, ruinous for society both morally and economically. As to
			the question what should one do with the money for which one has no
			use, the answer is that one may invest it in commerce, industry,
			etc. on the basis of partnership and share profits and losses alike.

		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
			us consider interest from the economic point of view. Loans are of
			two kinds. The consumptive loan is borrowed by the helpless needy
			persons for their personal needs and the economic loan is taken by
			businessmen for trade, commerce, industry, agriculture, etc. As to
			the first kind of loan, everyone knows that interest on it produces
			ruinous results. In every country the money-lenders and bankers are
			sucking the blood of the labourers, peasants and the common poor,
			and making their condition miserable. The interest charges render
			the payment of debt almost impossible for such people and they have
			to borrow one loan after the other to get out of this mess. Even
			after paying interest equal to many times the original principal,
			the principal still remains as it was before. The major portion of
			the income of the debtor is taken away by the money-lender and the
			poor debtor finds himself unable to make both ends meet. Naturally
			this kills the interest of the labourers in their work. When the
			fruit of their labour is taken away by others, they cannot put their
			whole heart into their work. More than that: when worry, anxiety,
			poor food, etc.., spoil their health, they cannot afford even to buy
			the necessary medicine for want of money. Thus money-lending leads
			to the fattening and battening of a few at the expenses of the
			blood-sucking of the majority and results in the general
			deterioration of the nation. The inefficiency caused in their way
			lowers the quality and standard of national production. In the end
			the bloodsuckers themselves fall a prey to their own iniquity. When
			the suppressed anger and hatred of the depressed people engendered
			by the selfishness of the cruel money-lenders, bursts out into a
			bloody revolution, it sweeps away their honour and lives along with
			their ill-gotten wealth.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As to the
			fixed interest on economic loans, three out of the many evils are
			given below
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) Those
			concerns that cannot pay an interest higher than or equal to the
			market rate cannot draw in capital howsoever useful they may be for
			the nation. All the available money flows into those channels of
			commerce and industry which can bring interest equal to or greater
			than the market rate of interest, howsoever harmful or ruinous they
			might be from the national point of view.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) There
			is no business commercial, industrial, agricultural that can
			guarantee a fixed and uniform rate of profit, say five, six or ten
			per cent or more under all circumstances. Not to speak of such a
			guarantee, there cannot be any guarantee against loss in any
			business. Therefore, the business which borrows capital at a fixed
			rate of interest can never be free from risk or loss.</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) As
			the money-lender himself is not directly a partner in the profit or
			the loss of the business but keeps in view only his guaranteed fixed
			interest, he is not interested in its welfare. His only concern is
			his own interest; therefore he very selfishly tries to withdraw and
			withhold his money whenever he has even the slightest fear of a
			slump in the market. In this way he creates panic by his selfishness
			and paves the way for a further crisis and when there is already a
			crisis, he accelerates it into a disaster.
		</P>
		<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The above
			mentioned three evils of interest are so obvious that they are well
			known to everyone who knows even the ABC of economics. Can then
			anyone deny the truth of the natural law enunciated by Allah that
			interest does not increase but decreases the national economic
			wealth?

			such a condition generally occurs on a journey. Moreover, inability
			to get a scribe is not an essential condition for holding something
			as a pledge. If a needy person cannot obtain a debt unless he
			delivers something as security for it, he is allowed to do so. The
			Qur'an deliberately omits the mention of this latter condition,
			because it intends to teach generosity to the Believers. It is
			obviously below the dignity of a man of high character not to lend
			money to a needy person without having a pledge in hand. It is,
			however, understood that if the pledge is productive, the creditor
			should keep a regular account of the produce and deduct it from the
			debt; otherwise any profit drawn from the pledged property would be
			interest. In this connection, one should also know that the only
			object in view of holding a pledge is the security of the repayment
			of the debt and it does not entitle the creditor in any way to make
			profit out of it. For instance, if a creditor himself lives in the
			house which he holds as a pledge for his debt or if he lets it to
			someone else, he in fact is guilty of taking interest, if he does
			not credit the rent of the house to the debtor, for there is no
			difference between taking direct interest on a debt or earning money
			from it or making use of the property delivered as a pledge. The
			creditor, however, may benefit from the milk of a pledged head of
			cattle, or may ride or carry burden on a horse, camel, etc., because
			that would be the compensation for the fodder given to them.&nbsp;

			order to understand the true spirit of this prayer, it should be
			kept in view that these verses were revealed on the occasion of the
			Mi'raj (Ascension to Heaven) of the Holy Prophet about a year before
			his migration to Madinah. At that time the struggle between Islam
			and kufr had reached its climax and the persecution of the Believers
			was at its worst. And this was not confined to Makkah alone: there
			was no place in the whole of Arabia where a Muslim was allowed to
			live in peace. It was to cope with these circumstances that the
			Muslims were taught to utter this prayer to Allah. It is
			self-evident that when the Master Himself teaches the servat the way
			of begging from Him, the servant gets the conviction that his
			request will be granted. That is why this prayer tilled the Muslims
			with extraordinary courage and brought peace of mind to them in the
			hour of their worst persecution. Moreover, this prayer taught theta
			to keep their passions under control and within the limits contained
			in this prayer and not to allow them to turn into wrong channels.
			That is why it is free from any kind of bitterness against their
			enemies, and there is not any tinge in it of revenge or of
			worldliness. This was urgently needed at that time because the
			Muslims were undergoing greater hardships and monetary losses and
			suffering untold cruelties and were pressed hard both physically and
			economically. Incidentally, the contrast between the high ideals
			contained in their prayer and the persecution which the Believers
			were suffering at that time brings out clearly the high standard of
			the spiritual and moral training they were receiving even at that
			critical time. And that is the high standard of morality that has
			been laid down for every true believer to attain.</P>
