this Surah contains the characteristics of both the Makki and the
Madani Surahs, the commentators have differed as to its period of
revelation, but in the light of its style and themes we are of the
opinion that a part of it (vv. 1-24) was sent down in the last stage
of the Makki life of the Holy Prophet a little before migration and
the rest (vv. 25-78) during the first stage of his Madani life. That
is why this Surah combines the characteristics of both the Makki and
the Madani Surahs. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

This is indicated by vv. 25-41 and confirmed by the occasion of the
revelation of vv. 39-40. It appears that the month of Zul-Hijjah must
have brought to the immigrants nostalgic memories of their homes in
Makkah and naturally they must have thought of their Sacred City and
of their Hajj congregation there, and grieved to think that the

visiting the Sacred Mosque. Therefore, they might even have been
praying for and expecting Divine permission to wage war against those
tyrants who had expelled them from their homes and deprived them of
visiting the House of Allah and made it difficult for them to follow
the way of Islam. It was at this psychological occasion that these

been debarred from visiting it. Therefore, permission for waging war
against those tyrants has been given to oust them from there and to
establish the righteous way of life for establishing virtue and
eradicating evil. According to Ibn Abbas, Mujahid, Urwah bin Zubair,
Zaid bin Aslam, Muqatil bin Hayyan, Qatadah and other great
commentators, v. 39 is the first verse that grants the Muslims
permission to wage war. Collections of Hadith and books on the life
of the Holy Prophet confirm that after this permission actual
preparations for war were started and the first expedition was sent
to the coast of the Red Sea in Safar A.H. 2, which is known as the
Expedition of Waddan or Al- Abwa. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

Satan tried to interfere with his desire.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote98anc" HREF="#sdfootnote98sym"><SUP>98</SUP></A>
But Allah eradicates the mischiefs worked by Satan and confirms His
Revelations,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote99anc" HREF="#sdfootnote99sym"><SUP>99</SUP></A>
for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote100anc" HREF="#sdfootnote100sym"><SUP>100</SUP></A>
(He allows this) so that He may make Satan's obstacles a trial for
those, whose hearts suffer from the disease (of hypocrisy) and whose
hearts are false--the fact is that these unjust people have gone far
away in their enmity-and so that those who have knowledge may realize
that this (Message) is the Truth from Allah and may believe in it,
and their hearts may submit humbly to it. Most surely Allah always
guides the Believers to the Straight Way.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote101anc" HREF="#sdfootnote101sym"><SUP>101</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	Day of Resurrection and the end of the world is inevitable&quot;. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) Most
	surely Allah will bring back to life all the people who have died&quot;,
	Let us now consider how these signs point to the above five
	realities: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	&quot;Allah is the Truth&quot;: In order to prove this, let us first
	take the case of man. All the stages of his development are a clear
	proof that Allah has designed them with wisdom. He takes his birth
	from a sperm-drop which itself is produced in a wonderful manner.
	The food, which a man takes, turns into hair, flesh, bones and a
	part of it is turned into semen, which is potentially capable of
	producing millions of human beings. It is the Wise and True God Who
	decides which of these millions of seeds from the semen should be
	utilized to make a woman pregnant by mixing the seed with the
	egg-cell. This insignificant thing turns into a living child in nine
	months in the womb of the mother. If we consider the different
	stages of the child's birth we come to the inevitable conclusion
	that all these have been designed by the True, Ever Living Designer.
	For it is He Who decides whether it should be a male or a female,
	seeing or blind, etc. Then it is He Who decides how long a child is
	destined to live. All these things are a clear proof that Allah
	alone is the Truth. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) &quot;He
	brings the dead to life&quot;: Even a little thinking on the right
	lines will convince every sensible and honest man that this process
	of bringing the dead to life is continuously going on before our
	eyes. Every human being has been created from a &quot;dead&quot;
	sperm-drop. Then he gets life from &quot;dead things&quot; like food
	containing dead matter like coal, iron, lime, salts, gases, which
	help make him a living human being. Then let us consider our
	surroundings. Seeds of different things which had been scattered
	here and there by the wind and birds, and the roots of different
	kinds of vegetation which lay rotten and dead in the soil, spring up
	to life as soon as there occurs a sprinkling of rain water. This
	process of the dead coming to life is observed during every rainy
	season year after year. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
	&quot;Allah has power over everything&quot;: There are people who
	believe that no doubt Allah created everything and is governing the
	universe, but He cannot do anything in the future in addition to or
	apart from this. This is because they do not observe the phenomena
	of His powers which have been and are appearing every moment. They
	do not realize that if man-His creation ran perform wonderful feats
	of science which could not even be dreamed of in the former ages,
	why should Allah alone be held as having only limited powers?</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) &quot;The
	Day of Resurrection is inevitable&quot; and &quot;Most surely Allah
	will bring back to life all the people who have died&quot;: These
	two are the rational corollaries of the preceding three premises.
	Allah is All-Powerful and therefore can bring about Resurrection at
	any moment He wills. He can also bring back to life all the dead
	people just as He brought to life human beings out of nothing in the
	first instance. As He is All-Wise, He has not created human beings
	without any object and purpose. He will judge their worldly lives in
	accordance with the object and purpose for which He created them. He
	will call them to account for everything He entrusted to them. This
	is very simple: even human beings ask one another to render an
	account of the property etc. they entrust to others. Likewise,
	Allah's wisdom requires to call every human being to account for the
	things entrusted to him. Then human nature also demands that there
	should be a differentiation between good and bad, and it expects the
	reward of good works and dreads the punishment of bad deeds. That is
	why the people have set up judicial courts. Thus man cannot imagine
	that the Creator will not call him to account for the things, powers
	and faculties, etc. which He has entrusted to him. Therefore common
	sense confirms that Allah will hold the Last Judgment so that every
	one should get his due reward and his due punishment.</P>

	successful in this world, but even if he loses it altogether, he is

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) What
	is meant by the &quot;Sacred Mosque&quot; ? Does it mean the mosque
	itself or includes the whole &quot;Inviolable Place&quot; of Makkah?</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) What
	is meant by &quot;equal rights&quot; of its dwellers and the
	outsiders ? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to some jurists it means the &quot;Sacred Mosque&quot; itself and
	not the whole of Inviolable Makkah. They base this opinion on the
	apparent wording of the Qur'an, and say that by &quot;equal rights&quot;
	is meant equal rights only in regard to worship in it. They cite a
	Tradition of the Holy Prophet to support their opinion. He said: &quot;O
	children of 'Abd Manaf, those of you who will have authority over
	the affairs of the people, should not stop anybody from moving round
	the Ka'bah or froth offering prayers in it at any time of the day or
	night.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Imam
	Shafi'i and others who support this view are of the opinion that it
	is wrong to conclude from this verse that the rights of the dwellers
	and the outsiders are equal in every respect, but they are equal
	only in regard to the right of worship and in nothing else, for the
	people of Makkah owned the lands and the houses of Makkah before
	Islam and also after it. So much so that during the time of Caliph
	Umar, the house of Safwan bin Umayyah was actually purchased from
	him for the purpose of making a prison in Makkah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	others who hold that the &quot;Sacred Mosque&quot; refers to the
	whole of the &quot;Inviolable Place&quot; of Makkah derive their
	authority from verses 196 and 217 of Chapter II (Al-Baqarah). They
	argue that Hajj is not performed only in the Ka'bah (the Sacred
	Mosque), but the pilgrim has to visit Mina, Muzdalifah, `Arafat,
	etc. for the performance of Hajj rites. Thus, they hold that
	equality is not merely in regard to worship in the &quot;Sacred
	Mosque&quot;, but in regard to all other rights in Makkah. As this
	place has been appointed for Hajj by Allah for all alike, none has
	any right of ownership in it. Anyone can stay anywhere he likes and
	node can prohibit him from doing so. They cite many Traditions in
	support of their opinion:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Abdullah bin `Umar reports that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Makkah
	is the place where travelers have to stay: therefore its lands
	cannot be sold nor can anyone charge rent for its houses.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	According to Ibrahim Nakha`i, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Makkah
	has been made an &quot;Inviolable Place&quot; by Allah: therefore
	selling its land and charging of rent for its houses is unlawful&quot;.
	Mujahid has also reported a tradition almost in similar words. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
	Alqamah says, &quot;During the time of the Holy Prophet, and of the
	first three Caliphs, the lands of Makkah were regarded as common
	property and one could live there or allow others to live therein.&quot;
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4)
	`Abdullah bin `Umar says, &quot;Caliph `Umar had ordered that no
	resident of Makkah should close the door of his house during the
	Hajj season.&quot; According to Mujahid; Caliph `Umar had ordered
	that the people of Makkah should not put doors to enclose their
	courtyards but keep them open so that anyone who liked might come in
	and stay there. The same has been related by `Ata' with the addition
	that Suhail bin `Amr was the only exception to this rule, who was
	allowed to put a door in his courtyard in order to safeguard his
	camels in connection with his trade. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5)
	`Abdullah bin `Umar also says that the one who receives rent for his
	house in Makkah fills his belly with fire. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6)
	`Abdullah bin `Abbas says that Allah has made the whole of Makkah
	the &quot;Sacred Mosque&quot; where all have equal rights, Therefore

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) `Umar
	bin `Abdul `Aziz sent an order to the governor of Makkah to this

	because it is unlawful&quot;. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On the
	basis of the above traditions, quite a few of the followers of the
	Companions and also, Imams Malik, Abu Hanifah, Sufyan Thauri, Ahmad
	bin Hanbal and Ishaq bin Rahawayah from among the Jurists, are of
	the opinion that it is unlawful to sell a piece of land and to
	charge rent, at least during the Hajj season, in Makkah. However,
	the majority of the Jurists are of the opinion that people can own
	houses in Makkah and can sell them as buildings but not as land. In
	my opinion, this last view seems to be the right one because it
	conforms with the Qur'an and the Sunnah and the practice of the
	rightly-guided Caliphs. It is obvious that Allah has not made Hajj
	obligatory for the Muslims of the whole world in order to provide a
	means of income for the people of Makkah. As Allah Has set apart the
	&quot;Inviolable Place&quot; for the benefit of all the Believers,.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) It is
	unlawful to wage war or shed blood within it. On the second day of
	the conquest of Makkah, the Holy Prophet declared, &quot;O people,
	Allah has trade Makkah a Sanctuary since the very creation of this

	Resurrection; therefore, it is not lawful for any man, who believes
	in Allah and the Day of Resurrection, to shed blood here&quot;. Then
	he added, &quot;Suppose a man legalizes bloodshed here on the basis
	of the precedent that I waged war here, tell him, 'Allah made it
	lawful for His Messenger and not for you'. It was made lawful for me
	for a short interval of the day. Then it was again made &quot;Inviolable&quot;
	as before&quot;.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) It is
	unlawful to cut naturally growing trees or uproot the grass which
	has grown there. It is also prohibited to hunt birds and animals
	within the boundary or to drive them out from the &quot;Inviolable
	Place&quot; for hunting. It is, however, lawful to kill a serpent, a
	scorpion and other harmful animals and to uproot dry grass and
	&quot;Izkhir&quot; which is a kind of grass.

	Hajj or 'Umrah&quot; to enter therein without Ihram. However, there
	is a divergence of opinion in regard to the entry of others than the
	pilgrims without Ihram. According to 'Abdullah bin `Abbas no one is
	allowed to enter therein without Ihram in any case, and this has
	been supported by a saying each of Imam Ahmad and Imam Shafi`i.
	According to other sayings of Imams Ahmad and Shafi`i, those people
	who have to visit the' &quot;Inviolable Place&quot; frequently in
	connection with trade and business, are excepted. Imam Abu Hanifah,

	stand on three feet; then they would slaughter it. The same is

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It should
	be noted well that the command of sacrifice as contained in verses
	36 and 37 is not for the pilgrims alone and that the performance of
	sacrifice is not confined to Makkah on the occasion of Hajj. It is a
	general command for all those Muslims who are well off. They have
	been enjoined to be grateful to Allah because He has subjected these
	animals for the good of all human beings. Therefore they are
	required to sacrifice the animals during these days so that they may
	spiritually join those who go to Makkah to perform Hajj.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are
	many authentic Traditions to the effect that the Holy Prophet made
	sacrifice on this occasion, while he was personally at al-Madinah:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) &quot;The
	one who does not perform sacrifice even though he can should not
	join us in the `Id Prayer&quot;. (Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Majah). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	According to a Tradition reported by Ibn 'Umar, the Holy Prophet
	dwelt at al-Madinah for ten years and performed sacrifice every
	year. (Tirmizi). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
	According to Hadrat Anas, the Holy Prophet said: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	one who sacrificed an animal before the 'Id Prayer, should offer
	another sacrifice; but the one who sacrificed his animal after the
	'Id Prayer, did the right thing and followed the way of the
	Muslims&quot;. (Bukhari) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It this
	connection, it is note-worthy that no `Id Prayer is held on the
	tenth of Zil-Hajj in Makkah: therefore the injunction was meant for
	all Muslims and not only for those performing Hajj at Makkah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus, it
	is clear that the sacrifice on the occasion of 'Id which is observed
	in the whole Muslim world is a Sunnah of the Holy Prophet and has
	been enjoined by him. The only dispute is whether it is obligatory
	in nature or only a Sunnah. Ibrahim Nakha'i, Imams Abu Hanifah,
	Malik, Muhammad and, according to a Tradition, Imam Abu Yusuf too,
	are of the opinion that it is Obligatory in nature. On the other
	hand, Imams Shafi`i and Ahmad bin Hanbal regard it only as a Sunnah
	of the Muslims, and Sufyan Thauri has also agreed with them, saying
	that there will be no harm if a person does not offer a sacrifice.
	It is, however, an irony that some of the &quot;learned&quot;
	Muslims of our time, who follow neither the Qur'an nor the Sunnah,
	and are only guided by personal whims, have declared that if there
	is a consensus of opinion of the Muslims, they can give up the
	practice of sacrifice on the occasion of Eid.

	been described. This naturally serves as a prelude to the armed

	rituals and the objects of Hajj have been described to bring home to
	the disbelievers that they had no right to debar anyone from Hajj.
	On the other hand, the Muslims are being prepared to fight not with
	the intention of wreaking vengeance but for the sake of reform. At
	the same time sacrifice on the occasion of Hajj has been prescribed
	as a permanent rite to enable them (and the Muslims of the whole
	world) to commemorate Hajj and the rites connected with it, so that
	they might refrain from wreaking vengeance on the people of Makkah
	for the persecution to which they had been subjected. They have,

	against it is a clear proof of its being the Truth. It is very

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If we
	consider it in the context in which it occurs, it becomes obvious
	that it was sent down to refute the wrong appraisal of the casual
	observers that the Holy Prophet had &quot;failed&quot; to achieve
	his desired object. This was because he had striven for thirteen
	long years to persuade his people to accept his Message but the
	apparent result was that he had not only failed in this, but he and
	the small band of his followers had been forced to leave their
	homes. As this &quot;exile&quot; contradicted his claim that he was
	a Prophet of Allah and had His approval and succor with him, some
	people became skeptical about it. Moreover, they became doubtful
	about the truth of the Qur'an, because they were not being visited
	by the scourge, which was inflicted on those who treated the Prophet
	as false. His antagonists scoffed at him, saying, &quot;Where is
	that succor of Allah and the scourge with which we were threatened?&quot;
	The answer to these doubts of the disbelievers was given in the
	preceding passage, and in this passage the addressees were those who
	were influenced by this propaganda. Briefly the whole answer was to
	this effect: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;lt
	is not a new thing that the people of a Messenger have treated him
	as an impostor for it has always been happening like this: You can
	see from the remnants of those peoples who treated their Messengers
	as impostors how they were punished for their mischief. You can
	learn a lesson from them, if you will. As regards the delay in the
	coming of scourge, the Qur'an never threatened the disbelievers &ograve;
	with immediate punishment, nor is it the job of the Messenger to
	inflict punishments. The scourge is sent by Allah, but He is not
	hasty in sending His torment. He gives respite to the people to mend
	their ways as He is giving you now. Therefore, you should not be
	under any delusion that the threats of scourge are empty threats. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;It
	is also not a new thing that the desires and wishes of a Prophet
	meet with obstacles or that false propaganda is made against his
	Message for the same has already happened with regard to the
	Messages of the former Prophets. But ultimately Allah eradicated the
	mischief worked by Satan and made the Message successful. Therefore
	you should take a warning from the past history of Satan's mischiefs
	and their ultimate failure. You should note it well that the
	obstacles and the mischiefs of Satan are a trial and means that help
	attract the righteous people towards Islam and winnow the dishonest
	people away from it&quot; . 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is a
	pity that in spite of the above clear and simple meaning of the
	passage which fits in well with the context, a grave
	misunderstanding has arisen because of a tradition which has not
	only changed its meaning entirely and rendered it irrelevant in the
	context but has helped make doubtful the very basic Articles of the
	Faith. Therefore we are making a critical appraisal of the tradition
	in order to show how to make the right use of traditions for the
	correct interpretation of the Qur'an. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to this tradition, the Holy Prophet had a strong longing and desire
	to this effect: &quot;I wish some Revelations were sent down to tone
	down the abhorrence of the mushrik Quraish against Islam so as to
	bring them nearer to it, or at least the criticism against their
	creed may not be so severe as to arouse their enmity&quot; . 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">While he
	was cherishing this desire, it so happened that one day when he was
	sitting in a big gathering of the Quraish, Surah An-Najm (LIII) was
	sent down and he began to recite it. When he came to vv. 19, 20:
	&quot;Have you ever considered about this Lat and this `Uzza, and a
	third (goddess) Manat, &quot;all of a sudden he recited, &quot;These
	are exalted goddesses; indeed their intercession may be expected&quot;.
	After this he continued to recite Surah An-Najm up to the last verse
	and then fell down in prostration and all the Muslims and the
	mushriks of the Quraish also did the same, for the latter said, &quot;Now
	we have no difference with Muhammad; we also profess that Allah is
	the Creator and the Provider and that these deities of ours are
	merely our intercessors with Him&quot; . After this, when in the
	evening Angel Gabriel came, he said, &quot;What have you done? I did
	not bring these two sentences&quot;. At this the Holy Prophet became
	very sad and Allah sent down vv. 73 75 of Surah Bani Isra`il (XVII):
	&quot;O Muhammad! these people have left no stone unturned to tempt
	you away from that which We have revealed to you so that you might
	fabricate something in Our name. Had you done that, they would have
	made you their friend. It was just possible that you might have
	inclined a little towards them, if We had not given you strength.
	But if you had done so, We would have made you taste double
	chastisement in this world as well as in the Hereafter: then you
	would have found no helper against Us&quot;. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But in
	spite of this, he continued to be grieved till Allah sent down v. 52
	of this Surah (Al-Hajj) in which Allah consoled him, saying that the
	same had been happening to the former Prophets. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	thing that happened in the meantime was that the story reached the
	migrants to Habash that there had been a reconciliation between the
	Holy Prophet and the disbelievers of Makkah. Accordingly, many of
	them returned to Makkah only to learn that the news of
	reconciliation was wrong and the conflict between Islam and kufr was
	raging as furiously as before. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us make a critical study of this story which has been cited by Ibn
	Jarir and many other commentators and is even contained in many
	collections of Traditions. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) None
	of its reporters, except Ibn `Abbas, is a Companion. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) There
	are many major discrepancies and variations in its details. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	wording ascribed to the Holy Prophet in praise of the idols in each
	Tradition is different from that of others. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Moreover,
	these words have been attributed to different sources according to
	different Traditions: (a) These words were put in by Satan during
	the Revelation and the Holy Prophet imagined that they were revealed
	by Gabriel. (b) He himself uttered these words inadvertently, being
	urged by his own desire. (c) He was dozing when he uttered these
	words. (d) He intentionally uttered these words but in a manner as
	to question their veracity. (e) Satan interpolated these words into
	the Revelation, giving an impression that the Holy Prophet himself
	had recited them. (f) It was one of the mushriks who had recited
	these words. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Yet
	scholars of Tradition like Hafiz Ibn Hajar and jurists like Abu Bakr
	alJassas and rationalists like Zamakhshari and commentators like Ibn
	Jarir accept this story as true and consider it as a commentary on
	verse 52 of this Surah. Ibn Hajar argues like this: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Even
	though the links by which this Tradition has been related are either
	weak or &quot;broken&quot;, except in one case, the very fact that
	it has been related through so many &quot;links&quot; is a proof
	that there is some truth about it. The one which has strong links is
	by Said bin Jubair who has related it from Ibn `Abbas and the
	reporters of two more Traditions (which have been cited by Tabari)
	have been declared authentic by Bukhari and Muslim&quot;. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On the
	other side, there are other eminent scholars who declare this story
	to be utterly baseless. Ibn Kathir says, &quot;All the links of this
	Tradition are unauthentic and I have found no correct version of
	this with continuous links&quot;. Baihaqi says, &quot;This story has
	not been proved to be correct by the rules of reporting&quot;. When
	Ibn Khuzaimah was asked about it, he said, &quot;This story has been
	invented by heret cs&quot;. Qazi `Ayad says, &quot;The very fact
	that this Tradition is neither contained in any of the six authentic
	collections of Hadith nor has it been related in an authentic way by
	authentic reporters shows its weakness&quot;. Besides them, Imam
	Razi, Qazi Abu Bakr Ibn al-`Arabi, Alusi etc. have rejected it
	altogether. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is a
	pity that even those who reject this story have not done full
	justice to their cases. There are some who reject it because its
	&quot;links&quot; are weak. In other words, they would have accepted
	it, if its links were strong. Then there are others who reject it
	because its acceptance makes the whole Faith doubtful. This kind of
	reasoning may satisfy the believers but it cannot satisfy those who
	are already sceptical or intend to make a research into it with a
	view to making a correct appraisal of Islam. They will rather say,
	&quot;When a story is related by an eminent Companion and is
	contained in the collections of Traditions, there is no reason why
	we should reject it just because it makes your Faith doubtful&quot;.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the story critically and rationally to prove that it is
	unacceptable. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) Its
	internal evidence proves it to be wrong: (a) According to the story
	the incident happened after the first migration to Habash, for
	according to it some of the migrants returned to Makkah after
	hearing the story. Now the fact is that the migration took place in
	the month of Rajab of the fifth year of Prophethood and some of the
	migrants returned to Makkah three months later, i.e. in Shawwal of
	the same year. (b) Verses 73-75 of Chapter XVII in which the Holy
	Prophet was &quot;reproved&quot; for this incident were revealed in
	the eleventh or twelfth year of Prophethood. In other words, he was
	&quot;reproved&quot; by Allah five or six years after the incident.
	(c) This verse (52) in which the interpolation by Satan was
	abrogated was sent down in the first year of Hijrah, i.e. about two
	years after the reproof. Can a person in his senses believe' that
	the Holy Prophet 'was reproved for the interpolation after six
	years, and it was abrogated after nine years ? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	According to the story, this interpolation was made in Surah
	An-Najm. When the Holy Prophet was reciting the words, &quot;And a
	third (goddess) Manat'; he also recited the interpolated sentence,
	and then continued the recital up to the end of the Surah. It is
	said that the disbelievers of Makkah were so pleased with the
	interpolation that they declared, &quot;The differences between us
	and Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) have now come to an end&quot;.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Let us
	now read w. 19-23 of An-Najm along with the alleged interpolation
	(in italics): &quot;Have you ever considered about the reality of
	this Lat and ` Uzza and a third (goddess) Manat? These are exalted
	goddesses; indeed their intercession may be expected. What, do you
	have sons for yourselves add daughters for Him (Allah) ? This is
	indeed an unfair division. They are nothing but mere names which you
	and your forefathers have invented. Allah has sent down no authority
	in regard to them. They follow only conjectures and the whims of
	their own minds, although right guidance has come from their Lord&quot;.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Even a
	casual reader will detect an obvious contradiction in the passage.
	Immediately after &quot;praising&quot; the goddesses there is a hard
	hit on their worshipers, as if to say: &quot;O foolish people! How
	is it that you have ascribed daughters to Allah and sons to
	yourselves? All this is your own invention which has no authority
	from Allah&quot; . On the face of it, the interpolation makes the
	passage absurd which cannot be assigned even to a rational person
	not to speak of Allah. Then the story presumes that all the Quraish
	who were listening to it must have lost their senses; otherwise they
	could not have declared that their differences with Muhammad
	(Allah's peace be upon him) had been made up from thence. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From this
	internal evidence it has become clear that this story is absurd and
	meaningless. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) Now
	let us consider whether the occasions ascribed by the commentators
	to the revelation of the verses under discussion, fit in with the
	chronological order of the Qur'an. According to the story, the
	interpolation in Surah AnNajm (LIII) was made in the fifth year of
	Prophethood; the reproof was made in vv. 73-75 of Bani Isra'il
	(XV11) and then the interpolation was annulled and the incident
	explained in vv. 52-54 of Surah Al-Hajj (XXII). Now there could be
	only two possibilities about the time of their revelation: either
	the verses containing the reproof and the abrogation were sent down
	in the period in which the interpolation took place, or the verse
	containing the reproof was sent down along with Surah Al-Hajj
	(XXII). In the first case, the question arises: Why were these
	verses (XVII: 73-75) not inserted in An-Najm (LIII)? Why were they
	held in abeyance for six long years and then inserted in Surah Bani
	Isra'il (XVII), when it was revealed, and vv. 52-54 (containing the
	abrogation) inserted in Surah Al-Hajj (XXII) after a further delay
	of more than two years? Does it mean that the verses were sent down
	on one occasion and inserted years later haphazardly in one Surah or
	the other? In the second case, the question would arise: Does it
	stand to reason that the verses containing the reproof (XVII: 73-75)
	were sent down six years after the interpolation, and the verse of
	abrogation (XXII: 52) nine years after the incident? Still another
	question arises: What was the occasion of the revelation of the
	verses of reproof and abrogation in Chapters XVII and XXII in the
	context in which they occur? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) Now
	let us turn to the third principle of correct appraisal of the
	Qur'an. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">For a
	correct appreciation of the Qur'an it is essential to consider
	whether a particular commentary fits in with the relevant context of
	the Qur'an or not. If we make even a cursory study of XVII: 71-73,
	(Bani Isra'il), it will become obvious that there was no occasion
	for the alleged reproof in v. 73 and that there is no tinge of
	reproof in it, for the words of the verse refute the allegation that
	the Prophet was taken in by the mischief of the disbelievers. Then
	in Surah AI-Hajj (XXII), if we make a critical study of the verses
	that precede vv. 52-54 and follow them, it will become obvious that
	there was no occasion to console the Prophet for the &quot;interpolation&quot;
	and to annul it after nine years. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) We
	reiterate that no Tradition, however strong links it might have, can
	be accepted when the Text itself is a clear evidence against it, and
	when it does not fit in with the wording, the context, the order
	etc. of the Qur'an. When the incident is considered in this
	background, even a skeptical research scholar would be convinced
	that the Tradition is absolutely wrong. As regards a believer, he
	can never accept it, when he knows that it contradicts not only one
	verse but a large number of other verses of the Qur'an. He would
	rather believe, that the reporters of the Tradition might have been
	deluded by Satan and not the Holy Prophet. He would never believe
	that the Holy Prophet could interpolate even a single word in the
	Qur'an under the influence of a desire of his own: or that there
	could ever occur such a desire in his mind that he should make a
	compromise with the disbelievers by associating shirk with Tauhid:
	or that he could ever wish that Allah might not say anything to
	displease the disbelievers: or that the Revelation was made in such
	an unsafe and doubtful manner as to enable Satan to mix with it even
	a word in a manner as if it was also brought by Gabriel. Each of
	these things is contradictory to the clear Revelation of the Qur'an
	and the basic Articles of the Faith which we have learned from the
	Qur'an and the Holy Prophet. God forbid that we should accept any
	such Tradition that might lead to the above mentioned presumptions
	just because the Tradition seems to be &quot;authentic&quot; in
	every way. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It will
	be worth-while to consider the question: How is it that so many
	reporters of Traditions have related this story? Does it not show
	that there must have been some reality about it? Otherwise, so many
	reporters, who included many authentic and eminent scholars, could
	not have made such an heinous slander against the Qur'an and the
	Holy Prophet. Its answer is contained in the authentic collections
	of Traditions by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Nasa`i and Musnad
	Ahmad. The reality of the incident is this: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The Holy
	Prophet recited Surah An-Najm and performed prostration at the end
	of it. At this, all the hearers, both the Muslims and the mushriks,
	fell down in prostration. This was what really happened and there is
	nothing strange about-it. Let us depict the occasion: The Holy
	Prophet was reciting a forceful piece of the eloquent Qur'an in a
	very impressive manner. Naturally the occasion produced an emotional
	effect and all the listeners instinctively fell down in prostration
	along with him. It was because of such ecstasies produced by the
	Holy Prophet's recital of the Qur'an as this that the disbelievers
	dubbed him a &quot;sorcerer&quot;. As regards the story that the
	Holy Prophet praised the deities of the disbelievers, it appears
	that the Quraish concocted the story to hide their &quot;defeat&quot;.
	Probably someone or other of them explained away their defeat,
	saying, &quot;We ourselves heard Muhammad praising our deities.
	Therefore we also fell down in prostration along with him&quot;. As
	regards the migrants to Habash, they returned to Makkah when they
	heard the concocted story that there had been a compromise between
	the Holy Prophet and the Quraish. It appears that some of those
	people who had seen the Muslims and the mushriks falling down
	together in prostration, presumed that peace had been made between
	them, so the story traveled to the migrants in Habash who had no
	means to verify it and thus thirty-three of them returned to Makkah.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Naturally
	these three things-prostration by the Quraish, their explanation of
	it, and the return of the migrants from Habash-combined to evolve
	that story. So much so that some authentic people were also deluded
	by it, for to err is human, and the pious and intelligent people are
	no exception to it. However, the error of the latter proves to be
	more harmful, because their credulous followers accept with closed
	eyes their misconceptions along with their right conclusions. On the
	other hand, mischief mongers collect all such errors of the
	righteous people and exploit them to prove that all the collections
	of Traditions are false and should be rejected forthwith.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Imam

	`prostration'. But Imam 'Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik, Hasan Basri, Said
	bin al-Musayyab, Said bin Jubair, Ibrahim Nakha`i and Sufyan Thauri
	dispute this. The arguments of the two sides are briefly as follows:
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	former group of commentators base their opinion on the following: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	verb in the verse is in the imperative mood. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	Tradition of `Uqbah bin `Amir, which has been reported by Imam
	Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Tirmizi, Ibn Marduyah and Baihaqi, says, &quot;I
	asked, `O Messenger of Allah ! Dces the merit of Surah Al-Hajj
	consist in the fact that it contains two verses requiring
	prostration?' He replied, `Yes, the one who does not prostrate on
	these two verses, should not recite them.' &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	Tradition of Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah in which `Amr bin `As says that
	he was told by the Holy Prophet that there were two verses requiring
	prostration in Surah Al-Hajj. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4)
	Sayings of Hadrat `Umar, `Ali, `Uthman, Ibn `Umar, Ibn `Abbas, Abul
	Darda, Abu MUsa Ash`ari and `Ammar bin Yasir to the effect that
	Surah AIHajj contains two prostrations.' 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	latter group of commentators argue as follows; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The verse
	contains a command both for Sajdah (prostration) and for Ruku'
	(bowing in prayer), which implies the whole Islamic Prayer according
	to the Qur'anic usage, and not `prostration' alone. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	tradition reported by 'Uqbah bin `Amir is unauthentic as it has weak
	links. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	Tradition of 'Amr bin `As is also unreliable, because its reporters
	are not well known. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) As
	for the sayings of the Companions, Ibn 'Abbas has clearly explained
	that prostration in respect of the first verse (in Surah AI-Hajj) is
	obligatory, whereas in regard to the second, it is only suggestive.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote128sym" HREF="#sdfootnote128anc">128</A>The
	Arabic word Jihad is very comprehensive. It includes every kind of
	effort, exertion, conflict and war. Jihad for the cause of Allah
	means that it should be performed for .His service and for His
	approval against those who prevent others from following His Way.
	The performance of Jihad also requires that one should first of all
	fight against one's own self in order to subdue it. For there can be
	no true Jihad unless one fights against one's evil self and subdues
	one's desires and lusts to the obedience of Allah. The Holy Prophet
	himself has emphasized the need for this Jihad. Once when the
	warriors for the cause of Allah returned from Jihad, he said: &quot;You
	have returned from the lesser Jihad to the' greater Jihad.&quot;
	They asked, &quot;What is that greater Jihad.'&quot; The Holy
	Prophet replied, &quot;It is the Jihad against one's own desires and
	lusts.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Moreover,
	the battlefield for Jihad is, in fact, the whole world, and Islam

	religion of Prophet Abraham. Therefore, &quot;You should follow it.&quot;
	This is for three reasons: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	first addressees of the Qur'an were the Arabs who were more familiar
	with Prophet Abraham than with any other Prophet and acknowledged
	him to be a holy personage and their leader. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Prophet Abraham alone was the person whom the Jews, the Christians,
	the Muslims and the mushriks of Arabia and of the adjoining
	countries unanimously acknowledged as a great Prophet. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) When
	the Qur'an invites all these communities to follow the way of
	Abraham, it in fact, admonishes them that all their religions had
	been invented long after Prophet Abraham and, therefore, were not
	trustworthy because they contradicted many things taught by him. As
	for the mushriks of Arabia, they also acknowledged that idol-worship
	among them had been started by 'Amr bin Luhayy, who was a leader of
	Bani Khuza`ah, and had brought an idol, called Hubal, from Moab in
	about 600 B.C. So the religion to which Prophet Muhammad (Allah's
	peace and blessings be upon him) invited them was the same pure,
	un-adulterated religion which was taught by Prophet Abraham (Allah's
