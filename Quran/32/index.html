the Hereafter and the Prophethood, and to invite them to all these
three realities. The disbelievers of Makkah, when they talked of the
Holy Prophet in private, said to one another, &quot;This person is
forging strange things sometimes he gives news of what will happen
after death. He says: when you have become dust, you will be called
to render your accounts, and there will be Hell and Heaven. Sometimes
he says: these gods and goddesses and saints are nonentities: One God
alone is the Deity. And sometimes he says: the discourses which I
recite are not my own but Allah's Word. All these are strange things
which he presents.&quot;The answer to these doubts and misgivings
forms the theme and subject matter of this Surah. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this connection, the disbelievers have been told: &quot;Most
certainly it is Allah's Word, which has been sent down in order to
arouse a people who are sunk in heedlessness, being deprived of the
bounties and blessings of Prophethood. How can you call it a
fabrication when its having been sent dawn from Allah is manifest and
self evident?&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Then,
they have been asked, &quot;Use your common sense and judge for
yourselves which of the things presented by the Quran is strange and

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
a scene of the Hereafter has been depicted, the fruits of belief and
the evil consequences of disbelief have been mentioned and the people
exhorted to give up disbelief even before they meet their doom and
accept the teaching of the Quran, which will be to their own
advantage in the Hereafter. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
they have been told: It is Allah's supreme Mercy that He does not
seize man immediately for his errors to punish him finally and
decisively but warns him beforehand by afflicting him with small
troubles and hardships and calamities and losses and strokes of
misfortune so that he may wake up and take admonition. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
it is said: &quot;This is not the first and novel event of its kind
that a Book has been sent down upon a man from God. Before this the
Book had been sent upon Moses also, which you all know. There is
nothing strange in this at which you should marvel. Be assured that
this Book has come down from God, and note it well that the same will
happen now as has already happened in the time of Moses. Leadership
now will be bestowed only on those who will accept this Divine Book.
Those who reject it shall be doomed to failure.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
the disbelievers of Makkah have been admonished to the effect:&quot;See
the end of the doomed communities of the past by whose ruined
habitations you pass during your trade journeys. Will you like to
meet the same doom yourself? Do not be deluded by the apparent and
superficial. Today you see that no one is listening to Muhammad (upon
whom be Allah's peace) except a few young men and some slaves and
poor men, and he is being made the target of curses and ugly remarks
from every side. From this you have formed the wrong impression that
his mission will fail. But this is only a deception of your eyes.
Don't you see the phenomenon in your daily life that a land
previously lying absolutely barren starts swelling with vegetation
and plant life everywhere just by a single shower of the rain though
before this no one could ever imagine that under the layers of its
soil there lay hidden such treasures of greenery and herbage?&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, the Holy Prophet has been addressed to the effect: &quot;These
people mock at what you say and ask as to when you will attain this
decisive victory. Tell them: when the time comes for the final
judgment regarding you and us, believing then will not profit you at
all. If you have to believe, believe now. But if you intend to await
the final judgment, then await it as you please.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>Several
	Surahs of the Qur'an begin with one or the other such introductory
	sentence, which is meant to declare at the outset therefrom this
	discourse is being issued. This is apparently the same sort of an
	introductory sentence as an announcer speaks in the beginning of a
	radio program to tell which radio station he is speaking from. But
	unlike the ordinary announcement from a radio station, when the
	extraordinary declaration at the beginning of a Surah is made to the
	effect that this message is being issued by the Ruler of the
	Universe, it is not merely meant to specify the origin of the
	discourse, but, besides, it also puts forward a big claim, a great
	challenge and a severe warning, for at the very outset it gives the
	big news that this .is not human but the Lord of the Worlds' Word.
	This declaration at once brings man face to face with the grave
	question: &quot;Should I or should I not accept this claim? If I
	accept it I shall have to bow my head in submission before it for
	ever. Then, I shall be left with no freedom concerning it. If I do
	not accept it, I shall have to take the great risk that if it be
	really the Lord of the Worlds' Word, I shall have to meet with
	eternal misery and misfortune in consequence of rejecting it.&quot;
	That is why this introductory sentence solely on account of its
	extraordinary nature compels man to listen to this Word with frill
	attention and seriousness,. and then take the decision whether he
	would accept it as Divine Word or not;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here,
	what has been said is not merely that this Book has been sent down
	by the Lord of the Worlds, but, besides, it also asserts most
	forcefully:&quot; It is without any doubt the Book of God: there is
	absolutely no room for doubt about its having been revealed by
	Allah.&quot; If this assertive sentence is studied in the actual
	context itself, it will be seen that it contains the argument also
	along with the assertion, and this argument was not hidden from the
	people of Makkah before whom the assertion was being made. The whole
	life of the person presenting it had been spent before them. They
	had known him before he presented the Book as well as after he had
	presented it. They knew that the person presenting the Book with
	that assertion was the most righteous, the most serious and the most
	pious and virtuous man of their society. They also knew that until a
	day before he made the claim to Prophethood, no one had ever heard
	from him those things which he had started presenting suddenly just
	after his claim to Prophethood. They found a marked difference
	between the diction and style used in the Book and the diction and
	style used by Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) himself, in his
	daily life, and they also recognized naturally that one and the same
	person could not have two styles so different from each other. They
	were also experiencing the highly miraculous literature being
	presented in the Book and, being the Arabic speaking people
	themselves, knew that all their literary men and poets were feeling
	utterly helpless in producing anything the like of it. They were
	also not unaware that there was a world of difference between the
	literary productions and orations of their poets and sorcerers and
	orators, and the Divine discourses being recited before them and the
	sublimity of the pure themes being presented in them. They did not
	see in the Book and in the message of the one presenting it any
	trace whatever of selfishness, which is always present in the work
	and message of a false claimant to prophethood. They could not find
	out, however, hard they might have tried, that Muhammad (upon whom
	be Allah's peace) by laying claim to Prophethood was trying to
	secure a certain benefit for himself or his family or his clan and
	tribe, or that he had any vested interest in the message he gave.
	Then, they could also see what sort of the people of their society
	were being drawn to his message and what great revolution was taking
	place in them as soon as they came in contact with his invitation.
	AII these things together supported and proved the assertion and
	claim. That is why in that background it was enough to say that it
	is beyond any doubt a Book that pas been sent down by the Lord of
	the Worlds. No further argument was needed to substantiate the
	claim.&nbsp;

	without any doubt the Book of God,&quot; and no further argument was
	needed to be advanced to prove the Qur'an to be Divine Word, so in
	this verse also the only thing being said to refine the
	disbelievers' charge that the Qur'an was being forged is: &quot;It
	is the Truth from your Lord.&quot; The reason for it is the same as
	we have given in E.N. 1 above. The listeners were well aware of the
	person who was presenting the Qur'an, of the environment in which he
	was presenting it and the confidence and grace with which he was
	presenting it; they also knew the Book, its diction and literary
	excellence and its themes; they were also feeling the influence and
	impact it was having on contemporary society of Makkah. Under those
	conditions the Book's being the Truth sent down by the Lord of the
	Worlds, was such an evident factual reality that the mere mention of
	it in clear and definite terms was enough to refute the accusation
	of the disbelievers. Any attempt to strengthen this assertion by
	resort to reasoning would have caused it to be weakened instead. The
	case would be like this. Supposing it's day and the sun is shining
	bright, and a stubborn person calls it a dark night. To refute him
	it would be enough to say: &quot;Do you call it a night when the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One
	should note that in Arabia the light of the true Faith was first of
	all spread by the Prophets Hud and- Salih, who lived in the
	pre-historic age. They were followed by the Prophets Abraham and
	Ishmael, who lived 2,500 years before the Holy Prophet. After them
	the last Prophet to be raised in Arabia before the Holy Prophet was
	the Prophet Shu'aib, who had passed about 2,000 years earlier. This
	is a very long period. That is why it has been said, and rightly so,
	that no warner had come to those people. This did not mean that no
	warner had ever come to them, but it meant that the people had long
	stood in need of a warner. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here,
	another question may arise in the minds, which should be answered
	straightaway. One may ask: When no Prophet had come to the Arabs for
	hundreds of years before the Holy Prophet, what would be the basis
	of accountability of the people who had lived in that age of
	ignorance? They could not tell guidance from deviation and error.
	Then, if they had gone astray, how could they be held responsible
	for their deviation? The answer is this: The detailed knowledge of
	the true Faith might have been lost to those people, but even in
	that age of ignorance the people were not unaware that the true
	Faith was based on TauhId, and the Prophets had never taught
	idol-worship to their followers. This truth was also contained in
	those traditions which the Arabs had received from the Prophets born
	in their own land, and they were also aware of this through the
	teachings of the Prophets Moses, David, Solomon and Jesus (peace be
	upon all of them) who had been born in the land adjoining their own.
	In the traditions of Arabia also it was well known that in the
	earliest times the Arabs' real religion was the Religion of Abraham
	and that idol-worship had been .introduced among them by a person
	named `Amr bin Luhayy. In spite of the prevalence of shirk and
	idol-worship, there were living in different parts of Arabia many
	such people, who rejected shirk, professed Tauhid and openly
	condemned offering of sacrifices at the shrines of idols. In the age
	close to the Holy Prophet's own, there had passed people like Quss
	bin Sa`idat-il-Iyadi, Umayyah bin Abi as-Salt, Suwaid bin `Amr
	alMustaliqi, Waki' bin Salamah bin Zuhair al-Iyadi', `Amr bin Jundub
	al-Juhani, Abu Qais Sarmah bin Abi Anas, Zaid bin `Amr bin Nufail,
	Waraqah bin Naufal, 'Uthman bin al-Huwairith, `Ubaidah bin Jahsh,
	`Amir bin az-Zarb al-'Advani ' Allaf bin Shahab at-Tamimi; ,
	Al-Mutalammis bin Umayyah al-Kinani; , Zuhair bin Abi Salma, Khalid
	bin Sinan bin Ghais al-'Absi, `Abdullah al-Quda`i and many others,
	who were known as Hunafa'. These people publicly professed Tauhid as
	the basis of the Faith and declared their dissociation from the
	religion of the mushriks. Obviously they had got this concept from
	whatever had remained behind from the influence of the teaching of
	the Prophets. Moreover, the inscriptions belonging to the 4th and
	5th centuries A. D. , which have been discovered in Yaman as a
	result of modern archaeological research and investigation, reveal
	that a monotheistic religion existed there in that age, whose
	followers acknowledged ar-Rahman (the All-Merciful) and
	Rabb-us-sama' wa!-ard ( Lord of the heavens and earth) alone as the
	One and only Deity. An inscription. dated 378 A.D. has been found
	from the ruins of a house of worship, which says that this house of
	worship has been built for the worship of &quot;God of heavens&quot;
	or &quot;Lord of heavens&quot;. In an inscription of 465 A.D. there
	are words which clearly point to the doctrine of Tauhid. Similarly,
	an inscription of 512 A.D. has been discovered at Zabad, a place
	between the river Euphrates and Qinnasrin, in northern Arabia,
	bearing the words: Bism-ilahu, la 'izza illa lahu, /a shukra, ills
	lahv. All this shows that before the advent of the Holy Prophet, the
	teachings of the former Prophets had not altogether been forgotten,
	and there still existed many means which at least reminded man of
	the truth: &quot;Your God is only One God. &quot; (For further
	explanation, see E.N. 84 of Surah AI-Furqan).&nbsp;

	gap between the preceding and this sentence has been left for the
	listener to fill. The objection of the disbelievers as cited in the
	first sentence is so absurd that no need has been felt to refute it.
	Only its citation was regarded as enough to show its absurdity. For
	the two parts which make up the objection arc both unreasonable.
	Their saying: &quot;When we have become dust&quot; is meaningless
	for that which is &quot;we&quot; can never become dust. Dust is the
	destiny of the body after it has become devoid of the &quot;we&quot;
	The body itself is not the &quot;we&quot;. When alive, limbs and
	other parts of the body may be cut off one by one, but the &quot;we&quot;
	remains intact. No part of it is cut off with the cut off limb. And
	when the &quot;we&quot; has vacated a body, the &quot;we&quot;
	remains no longer applicable even in its remotest sense although the
	body still remains intact. That is why a sincere lover goes and
	buries the body of his beloved, because the beloved is no more in
	the body. He buries not the beloved but the empty body, which was
	once the home of his beloved. Thus, the very first premise of the
	disbelievers' objection is baseless. As for its second part, &quot;Shall
	we be re-created?&quot; this question containing surprise and denial
	would not have arisen, had the objectors considered and taken into
	account the meaning of the &quot;we&quot; and its creation. The
	present existence of this &quot;we&quot; is nothing more than that a
	little of coal and iron and lime and sonic other earthly substances
	got together from here and there to combine themselves into a body,
	which became the home of the &quot;we&quot;. Then what happens when
	it dies? When the &quot;we&quot; has left .the body, the constituent
	substances of its abode which had been gathered together from
	different parts of the earth go back to the same earth. The question
	is: He who had made this home for the &quot;we&quot;, can He not
	make the same home from the same substances once again and settle
	the &quot;we&quot; in it? When this was possible before and has in
	actual fact existed, what can hinder its possibility and its
	existing as an actual fact once again? These are such things as can
	be understood by the application of a little of the common sense.
	But why doesn't man allow his mind to think on these lines? Why does
	he raise the meaningless objections about the life hereafter and the
	Hereafter? Leaving out all these details, Allah has answered this
	question in the second sentence, saying: &quot;The fact is that they
	disbelieve in the meeting with their Lord.&quot; That is, &quot;The
	real thing is not this that the recreation of man is something odd
	and remote in possibility, which they cannot understand, but in
	fact, what prevents them from understanding this is their desire w
	live freely and independently in the world and commit any sin, any
	excess that they please and then escape Scot-free from here: they
	should not be held accountable for anything, nor answerable for any
	of their misdeeds.&quot;&nbsp;

	is, &quot;Your `ego' will not mix in the dust,` but as soon as its
	term of action comes to an end, God's angel of death will come and
	will take it out of the body and seize it completely. No part of it
	will be allowed to become dust with the body. It will be taken
	intact into custody and produced before its Lord.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Let us
	consider in some detail the facts which have been presented in this
	brief verse: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) It
	says that death does not occur as a matter of course, like the
	stopping of a watch suddenly when it needs re-winding, but for this
	purpose Allah has appointed a special angel, who comes to receive
	the soul precisely in the manner as an official receiver takes
	something into his custody. From the details which have been
	mentioned at other places in the Qur'an, it becomes apparent that
	the chief angel of death has a whole staff of the angels under him,
	who perform a variety of duties in connection with causing the
	death, seizing the soul and taking it into custody. Moreover, their
	treatment of a guilty soul is different from their treatment of a
	believing, righteous soul. (For details, see An-Nisa': 97, AI-An`am:
	93, An-Nahl: 28, AI-Waqi'ah: 83-94). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) It
	also shows that man does not cease to exist after death, but his
	soul survives the body. The words of the Qur'an: &quot;The angel of
	death shall seize you completely,&quot; point out the same reality.
	For something which does not exist cannot be seized. Seizing
	something and taking it into custody implies that the seized thing
	should be in possession of the seizer.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) It
	also shows that at the time of death that which is seized is not the
	biological life of man but his self, his ego, which is connoted by
	the words like &quot;I&quot; and &quot;we&quot; and &quot;you&quot;.
	Whatever personality this ego may have developed during its
	life-activity in the world, the same is taken out intact as a whole,
	without effecting any increase or decrease in its characteristics,
	and the same is made to return to its Lord after death. The same
	personality will be given a new birth and a new body in the
	Hereafter; the same will be subjected to trial; the same will be
	called to account; and the same will have to experience rewards or
	punishments.

	earthquakes, floods, epidemics, famines, riots, wars and many other
	disasters, in collective life, which affect hundreds of thousands of

	involved in the &quot;greater torment&quot; and give up the attitude
	and way of life in consequence of which they will have to suffer the

	which give man the feeling that he is helpless and that there is
	about him an All-Powerful Sovereign Who is ruling His universal
	Kingdom. These calamities remind each individual and group and
	nation that there is another Power above him Who is controlling
	their destinies. Everything has not been placed at man's disposal.
	The real Power is in the hand of the Sovereign. When a calamity from
	Him descends on man, you can neither avert it by any artifice, nor
	can escape from it by invoking a jinn, or a spirit, or a god or
	goddess, or a prophet or saint. Considered in this light, these
	calamities are not mere calamities but warnings of God, which are
	sent to make man conscious of the reality and to remove his

	guidance and became a prominent nation in the world. Alluding to
	this historical background, the Arabs are being told: 'Just as that
	Book was sent for the guidance of the Israelites, so has this Book
	been sent for your guidance. &quot;&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote37sym" HREF="#sdfootnote37anc">37</A>That
	is, &quot;Whatever progress the children of Israel made and whatever
	heights they attained by that Book, was not simply due to the reason
	that a Book had been sent among them. It was not an amulet that they
	might have hung around their necks and they might have started
	ascending the steps of glory under its good and protective
	influence. But the glory was the direct result of their firm faith
	in the Revelations of Allah, and of the patience and perseverance
	that they showed in following the Divine Commandments. Among the
	Israelites themselves also leadership fell to the lot of only those
	who were true believers of the Book of Allah and were not tempted at
	all by the greed of worldly gains and enjoyments. When in their love
	of the truth they stood firm against every danger, endured every
	loss and affliction, and exerted their utmost against every hostile
	force, from the lusts of their own selves to the external enemies of
	the true Faith, then only did they become the leaders of the world.
	The object is to warn the disbelievers of Arabia that just as the
	coming of the Book of Allah had decided the destinies of the
	children of Israel, so will this Book decide the destinies among
	you. Now only those people will become the leaders, who will believe
	in it and follow the Truth presented by it patiently and resolutely.
	Those who turn away from it are destined to end up in failure and
	wretchedness.&quot;&nbsp;

	allusion is to the differences and schisms in which the children of
	Israel were involved after they became deprived of the faith and
	belief and gave up obedience of their righteous leaders and were
	given to the worship of the world. One result of this is obvious and
	before the whole world: they suffer from disgrace and infamy and
	misfortune; the other result is that which is not known, to the
	world: it will appear on the Day of Resurrection.&quot;</P>

	experience of history that to whichever nation a Messenger came, the
	decision of its destiny became dependent upon the attitude it
	adopted with regard to him? If it rejected its Messenger, it could
	not escape its doom. The only people to escape were those who

	the context in view it becomes obvious that this thing has not been
	mentioned here for the sake of providing an argument for the
	life-after-death, as generally found in the Qur'an, but in this
	context its object is different. This, in fact, contains a subtle
	allusion to this effect: &quot;Just as a person seeing a barren land
	cannot imagine that it will ever bloom and swell with vegetation,
	.but a single shower of the rain sent by God changes its color
	altogether, so is the case with the message of Islam at this
	juncture. People think that it is not going to gain ground, but a
	single manifestation of Allah's power and grace will cause it to
	gain such glory that people will be amazed at its progress.&quot;</P>
