<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
background of the Surah is that the disbelievers of Makkah were
persistently refusing, on one pretext or the other, to accept the
message of Islam given by the Holy Prophet. Sometimes they would say
that he did not show them any sign to convince them of his
Prophethood; sometimes they would brand him as a poet or a sorcerer
and mock his message; and sometimes they would ridicule his Mission,
saying that his followers were either a few foolish youth, or the
poor people and slaves - whereas, they argued, if his Mission had
really some value for the people, the nobles and the elders would
have accepted it first. Thus, while on the one hand, the Holy Prophet
was becoming wearied by his efforts to show them rationally the
errors of their creeds and prove the truth of the Doctrines of Tauhid
and the Hereafter, the disbelievers, on the other, were never tired
of adopting one kind of obduracy after the other. This state of
affairs was causing great anguish and grief to the Holy Prophet. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Such
were the conditions when this Surah was revealed. It begins with
words of consolation to the Holy Prophet, implying, &quot;Why do you
fret for their sake?If these people have not believed in you, it is
not because they have not seen any Sign, but because they are
obdurate. They will not listen to reason they want to see a Sign
which makes them bow their heads in humility. When this Sign is shown
in due course of time, they will themselves realize that what was
being presented to them was the Truth.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this introduction, till verse 191, one and the same theme has been
presented continuously, and it is said: &quot;The whole earth abounds
in such Signs as can guide a seeker after truth to Reality, but the
stubborn and misguided people have never believed even after seeing
the Signs, whether these were the Signs of the natural phenomena or
the miracles of the Prophets. These wretched people have stubbornly
adhered to their erroneous creeds till the Divine scourge actually
overtook them.&quot; It is to illustrate this that the history of
seven of the ancient tribes has been told, who persisted in disbelief
just like the disbelievers of Makkah. In this connection, the
following points have been stressed: </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	Signs are of two kinds:(a) Those which are scattered all over the
	earth, and by seeing which an intelligent person can judge for
	himself whether what the Prophet is presenting is the Truth or not
	and (b) those which were seen by Pharaoh and his people, Noah's
	people, the Ad and the Thamud, Lot's people and the people of
	Aiykah. Now it is for the disbelievers to decide which kind of the
	Signs they are eager to see. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	mentality of the disbeliever has been the same throughout the ages;
	their arguments and their objections, and their excuses and
	subterfuges for not believing have been similar and ultimately the
	fates that they met have also been the same. Likewise, the Prophets
	in every age presented the same teachings, their personal character
	and their reasoning and arguments against their opponents were the
	same, and they were all similarly blessed with mercy by Allah
	Almighty. Both these patterns of behavior and conduct are found in
	history, and the disbelievers could themselves see as to which
	respective patterns they and the Holy Prophet belonged. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Allah
	is All Mighty, All Powerful and All Merciful at the same time.
	History contains instances of His Wrath as well as of His Mercy.
	Now, therefore, it is for the people to decide whether they would
	like to deserve Allah's Mercy or His Wrath. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Lastly,
	the discussion has been summed up, saying &quot;O disbelievers, if
	at all you want to see the Signs, why should you insist on seeing
	those horrible Signs that visited the doomed communities of the
	past? Why don't you see the Qur'an which is being presented in your
	own language? Why don't you see Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace
	and mercy) and his Companions? Can the revelations of the Qur'an be
	the work of a satan or a jinn? Does the recipient of the Qur'an
	appear to be a sorcerer? Are Muhammad and his Companions no
	different from a poet and his admirers? Why don't you give up
	disbelief and search your hearts for their judgment? When in the
	heart of your hearts you yourselves believe that the Revelations of
	the Qur'an have nothing in common with sorcery and poetry, then you
	should know that you are being cruel and unjust, and will certainly
	meet the doom meant for the cruel and unjust.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	Then, the disbelievers accused the Holy Prophet of being a sorcerer.
	This charge has been refuted by saying that the Qur'an has nothing

	is, &quot;It is not at all difficult for Allah to send down a Sign
	which would make all the disbelievers yield and submit. If, however,
	He does not send one, it does not mean that such a thing is beyond
	His powers, but the reason is that . belief under compulsion is not
	acceptable to Him. Allah wants that people should use their
	common-sense and recognize the Truth through the verses of the
	Divine Book and the Signs which are scattered all over the universe
	and are found even in their own selves. Then, when their hearts are
	satisfied that the message of the Prophets contains the Truth, and
	the beliefs and the creeds which are opposed to it, are false, they
	should willingly give up falsehood and adopt the Truth. This
	voluntary belief, acceptance of the Truth and rejection of
	falsehood, is what Allah demands from man. It is for this reason
	that Allah has bestowed upon man choice and free will, and freedom
	to follow any way, right or wrong, that he pleases. For the same
	reason He has placed in his nature both the tendencies, towards good
	and towards evil, and opened up before him both the ways, to piety
	and to sin. For the same purpose He has given Satan the freedom and
	respite to mislead him and has made arrangements of Prophethood,
	Revelation and invitation to goodness to guide him to the right way,
	and has placed man on trial to see whether he adopts the way of
	belief and obedience or of disbelief and sin. On the other hand, if
	Allah had adopted a method of coercing people to believe and obey,
	it would have defeated the very purpose of the trial and test. Then
	there was no need to send down the Signs for the purpose, but He
	would have created man with a pure nature, without any inclination
	for evil, disbelief and sin, and made him obedient by birth like the
	angels. This has been referred at several places in the Qur'an, for
	instance in Yunus: 99: ` Had your Lord willed all the dwellers of
	the earth would have believed in Him;&quot; and in Hud: 118: '&quot;Your
	Lord could have made mankind one community had He so willed, but now
	they will continue to follow different ways, but only those on whom
	Allah has His mercy (escape wrong ways). It will be so because He
	has created them for this (very freedom of choice and action).&quot;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote7sym" HREF="#sdfootnote7anc">7</A>After
	a brief introduction, historical events have been presented
	beginning with the story of Prophet Moses and Pharaoh, and attention
	has been drawn specifically to the following points: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	conditions under which Prophet Moses had to work were much harsher
	and more severe than those faced by the Holy Prophet Muhammad
	(Allah's peace be upon him). Prophet Moses belonged to a slave
	community very much suppressed by Pharaoh and his people. In
	contrast to them, the Holy Prophet was a member of the clan of
	Quraish and his family enjoyed an equal status with the other clans.
	Then Prophet Muses had been bred and brought up in the house of
	Pharaoh and after remaining a fugitive for ten years due to a charge
	of murder, he was commanded to go before the same king from whom he
	had fled for life. The Holy Prophet did not have to face any such
	situation. Then the empire of Pharaoh was the most extensive and
	powerful empire of the time and the meagre power of the Quraish had
	no comparison with it. In spite of that Pharaoh could not do any
	harm to Prophet Moses and ultimately perished in the conflict. From
	this Allaln wanted the Quraish to learn this lesson: &quot;None can
	defeat the one who has Allah to help him? When Pharaoh with all his
	might became helpless against Moses, how can you, O poor Quraish,
	succeed against Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
	blessings)'? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) There
	could not be clearer and more manifest Signs (miracles) than those
	which were shown to Pharaoh through Moses. Then in an open contest
	with the magicians before a gathering of hundreds of thousands of
	people to meet the challenge of Pharaoh himself, it had been
	conclusively demonstrated that what was presented by Moses, was not
	magic. The skillful magicians who were themselves Egyptians and had
	been summoned by Pharaoh himself bore witness to the fact that
	turning of Moses' staff into a serpent was a real change of nature,
	which could only happen through a Divine miracle, and not by any
	trick of magic. Then the magicians' believing in Moses immediately,
	even at the risk of life, proved beyond any doubt that the Sign
	presented by Moses was a miracle and not magic. Yet the disbelievers
	were not inclined to believe in the Prophet. Now how can you, O
	Quraish, say that you will believe only when you are shown a
	perceptible miracle and a physical Sign '? As a matter of fact, if a
	person is free from prejudice, false sense of prestige and vested
	interest, and has an open mind to appreciate the distinction between
	truth and falsehood, and is prepared to give up falsehood for the
	truth, he does not stand in need of any other signs than those found
	in this Book, in the life of the one presenting it and in the vast
	universe around him. On the contrary, an obstinate person, who is
	not interested in the truth, and who because of selfish motives is
	determined not to recognize and accept any such truth as may clash
	with his interests, will not be prepared to believe after seeing any
	sign whatever, even if the earth and the heaven are turned upside
	down in front of his eyes .</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) 'the
	tragic end of such obstinacy as met by Pharaoh is not something for
	which other people should become so impatient. Those who do not
	believe even after seeing with their own eyes the Signs of Divine
	power have inevitably to meet a similar fate. Therefore, instead of
	learning a lesson why do you insist on seeing such a dreadful sign?
	For comparison, see AIA'raf: 103-137, Y'unus: 75-92, Bani Isra'il:

	sentence, &quot;My breast straitens&quot;, shows that Prophet Moses
	was somewhat hesitant of going alone on such a difficult mission,
	and also had the feeling that he was not eloquent in speech. That is
	why he begged Allah to appoint Aaron too, as messenger to assist him
	who, being more vigorous in speech, could support and strengthen him
	as and when the need arose. It is just possible :hat in the
	beginning, the Prophet Moses might have begged that Aaron be
	appointed to Prophet hood instead of him, but later when he felt
	that Allah willed him to be appointed to that position, he might
	have appealed that Aaron should at least be made his counselor and
	assistant. We say this because here Prophet Moses is not praying for
	Aaron to be made his counselor, but says, &quot;Appoint Aaron to
	Prophet hood.&quot; On the other hand, in Surah Ta Ha, he says,
	&quot;Appoint for me a counselor from my family-(let it be) my
	brother Aaron.&quot; Then in Surah Al Qasas, he says, &quot;My
	brother Aaron is more vigorous in speech than myself, so send him as
	an assistant with me to confirm (and support) me.&quot; From this it
	appears that these two requests were made later, but originally
	Prophet Moses had begged Allah to appoint Aaron to Prophet hood
	instead of himself. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The Bible
	has a different story to tell. According to it, Prophet Moses,
	fearing that he would be rejected by the people of Pharaoh, and
	putting forward the excuse of his faltering speech, had declined to
	accept his appointment to prophet hood on the pretext that he lacked
	vigor and eloquence in speech : &quot;O my, Lord, send, I pray Thee,
	by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.&quot; (Exodus, 4: 13), Then
	Allah, of His own will, appointed Aaron to be his assistant and
	persuaded them: to go together before Pharaoh. (Exodus, 4: 1-13).

	reached Pharaoh and his people and they were planning to take
	revenge, he fled the country and took refuge in Midian. (See
	Al-Qasas: 15-21) Now when after a period of almost ten years of
	hiding he was suddenly called upon and commanded to go before
	Pharaoh, who had already a charge of murder against him, with the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote24sym" HREF="#sdfootnote24anc">24</A>To
	understated and appreciate this conversation fully, one should bear
	in mind the fact that as it is today, in the ancient times too, the
	concept of &quot;deity&quot; was confined to its religious sense
	only. The deity was meant to be worshiped and presented offerings
	and gifts, and because of its &quot;supernatural powers&quot; and
	authority the people were to pray to it for help and fulfillment of
	their desires. But a deity's being supreme legally and politically
	also and his right to enjoin anything he pleased in the mundane
	affairs and man's duty to submit to his commands as to superior law,
	has never been recognized by the so-called worldly rulers. They have
	always claimed that in the mundane affairs, they alone possess
	absolute authority and no deity has any right to interfere in the
	polity and law prescribed by them. This very thing has been the real
	cause of the conflict between the Prophets and their righteous
	followers, on the one hand, and the worldly kingdoms and governments
	on the other. The Prophets have been trying their utmost to make the
	worldly rulers acknowledge the sovereign and absolute rights of the
	Lord of the Worlds, but they in return have not only been claiming
	sovereign powers and rights for themselves, but have been
	considering every such person as a criminal and rebel, who has held
	someone else as a deity in the political and legal sphere. With this
	background one can easily understand the real significance of
	Pharaoh's words. Had it been a question of mere worship and
	offerings, he would have least bothered that Moses, forsaking all
	gods, regarded only Allah, the Lord of all Creation, as worthy of
	those rights. if Moses had invited him to serve Allah alone, he
	would not have felt provoked and offended. At the most he would have
	refused to give up the creed of his forefathers, or would have
	challenged Moses to have a debate with his own religious scholars.
	But what caused him provocation was that Prophet Moses was
	presenting himself as the representative of the Lord of all Creation
	and was conveying to him a political command as if he was a
	subordinate ruler and the representative of the superior authority
	was demanding obedience from him to the command. In this sense, he
	was not prepared to acknowledge any other political or legal
	authority, nor allow any of his subjects to acknowledge anybody
	instead of himself as the supreme ruler. That is why he challenged
	the teen &quot;Lord, of all Creation&quot;, for the message sent by
	Him clearly reflected sovereignty in the political and trot in the
	mere religious sense. Then, when Prophet Moses explained over and
	over again what he meant by the &quot;Lord of all Creation&quot;,
	Pharaoh threatened that if he held any one other than him as
	sovereign in the land of Egypt, he would be cast into prison.</P>

	took somebody else as Lord instead of him, he would cast him into
	the prison for life. But, after he had seen the Signs, he became so
	terror-stricken that he felt his kingdom to be at stake, and in his
	contusion he did not realize that he was talking meaninglessly to
	his servants in the court. Two men from the oppressed community of
	the Israelites were standing before the most powerful ruler of the
	time: they had no military force with them, they belonged to a weak
	and lifeless community, and there was no sign of any rebellion in
	any corner of the country, nor did they have the support of any
	foreign power, yet as soon as the miracles of the snake of the staff
	and the shining hand were shown, the tyrant desperately cried out:
	&quot;These two men want to seize power and deprive the ruling class
	of their sovereign rights!&quot; His apprehension that Moses would
	do so by force of his magic again reflected a confused state of
	mind, for nowhere in the world has a political revolution been ever
	brought about, nor a country taken, nor a war won merely by force of
	tragic. There were many magicians in Egypt, who could perform
	masterly tricks of tragic, but Pharaoh knew it well that they were

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that Pharaoh was a dishonest obdurate and deceitful person. When he
	saw that Moses had come out successful in the contest which he
	himself had arranged to be decisive, he concocted a plot and forced
	the magicians to confess it by coercion and threats. Had there been

	have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides and get
	crucified. The fact that the magicians remained steadfast and firm
	in their belief even in the face of such a horrible threat, proves
	that the accusation of plotting a conspiracy against Pharaoh was
	baseless. The fact was that the magicians being experts in their art
	had realized that what Moses had displayed was no magic, but surely
	a manifestation of the powers of Allah, Lord of the universe. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	thousands of the people who had gathered together from all corners
	of the land had themselves witnessed the great moral change that had
	occurred in the magicians as soon as they professed belief in the
	Lord of the universe. The same magicians who had been summoned to
	strengthen and secure the ancestral creed by means of their magic
	and who, a minute before, were humbly begging Pharaoh for rewards
	had now become so bold and ennobled spiritually that they would not
	take any notice of Pharaoh's powers and his threats and were even
	prepared to face death and extreme physical torture for the sake of
	their Faith. Thus psychologically there could not be a better

	caravans consisting of hundreds of thousands of the migrants were
	able to pass through safely, and on the other, Pharaoh and his hosts
	stepped in and reached the middle of the sea. In the natural course,
	a phenomenon like this has never occurred that due to a windstorm,
	however strong, the sea should have parted and stood like mighty
	mountains on either side for such a long time. According to verse 77
	of Ta Ha, Prophet Moses was commanded by Allah &quot;to make for
	them (the Israelites) a dry path across the sea. &quot; This shows
	that the smiting of the sea did not only result in dividing the
	waters into two parts, which stood like mighty mountains on either
	side, but it also created a dry path in between without any mud or
	slush. In this connection, one should also consider verse 24 of
	Surah Dukhan, which says that after Moses had crossed the sea along
	with his people, he was commanded by Allah &quot;to let the sea
	remain as it is because Pharaoh is to be drowned in it.&quot; This
	implies that if after crossing the sea, Moses had again struck it
	with his staff, the two sides would have rejoined, but he was
	forbidden to do so. Obviously, this was a miracle, and the view of

	part of the life-history of Prophet Abraham relates to the time when
	after his appointment to Prophethood, a conflict had started between
	him and his people on the questions of shirk and Tauhid. In this
	connection, the reader should also see Al-Baqarah: 258-260,
	Al-An`am: 75-83, Maryam: 41-50, Al-Anbiya': 51-70, As- Saffat:
	83-113, and Al-Mumtahanah: 4-5.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Qur'an has specially repeated this part of Prophet Abraham's life
	story over and over again because the Arabs in general and the
	Quraish in particular regarded themselves as his followers and
	professed his way and creed. Besides them, the Christians and the
	Jews also claimed that Abraham was their religious leader and guide.
	That is why the Qur'an admonishes them over and over again that the
	creed brought by Abraham was Islam itself, which is now being
	presented by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him),
	and which they are opposing tooth and nail. Prophet Abraham was not
	a mushrik, but an antagonist against shirk, and for the same reason
	he had to leave his home and country and live as a migrant in Syria,
	Palestine and Hejaz. Thus he was neither a Jew nor a Christian,
	because Judaism and Christianity appeared centuries after him. This
	historical argument could neither be refuted by the mushriks, nor by
	the Jews or the Christians, because the mushriks themselves admitted
	that idol-worship in Arabia had started several centuries after
	Prophet Abraham, and the Jews and the Christians also could not deny
	that Prophet Abraham had lived long before the beginning of Judaism
	and Christianity. This obviously meant that the special beliefs and
	customs which those people thought formed the basis of their
	religion, were not part of the original religion taught by Prophet
	Abraham. True religion was the one which had no tinge of those
	impurities, but was based on those worship and obedience of One
	Allah alone. That is why the Qur`an says: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Abraham
	was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a Muslim, sound in the
	Faith, and he was not of those who set up partners with Allah.
	Surely only those people who follow Abraham are entitled to claim a
	relationship with him. Now this Prophet and the believers are better
	entitled to this relationship.&quot; (Al An'am: 67, 68). &nbsp;

	with verses 81, 82 of Surah Maryam, which say: &quot;These people
	have set up other gods than Allah so that they may become their

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It should

	first case, there was every chance that the people would have felt
	offended and provoked, because it would have been difficult for them
	to understand how their own gods could be their enemies. As a matter
	of fact, Prophet Abraham appealed to the natural feeling of man that
	he is his own well-wisher and cannot wish ill of himself
	deliberately. This would inevitably have led the addressees to think
	whether what they were doing was really for their good and was in no

	Then Prophet Abraham briefly gives the arguments, which nobody could

	second reason for worshiping Allah and Allah alone is that Allah had
	not become unconcerned with man after creating him and let him alone
	to see other supporters for help, but had also taken the
	responsibility of making arrangements for his guidance, protection
	and fulfillment of his needs. The moment a human child is born, milk
	is produced for it in the breasts of its mother, and some unseen
	power teaches it the way to suck it and take it down the throat.
	From the first day of his life till his death, the Creator has
	provided in the world around him all necessary means required for
	every stage of his life for his development and guidance, sustenance
	and survival. He has also endowed him with all those powers and
	abilities which are needed to use the means with advantage and given
	him all necessary guidance for every sphere of life. Then for the
	protection of human life against all sorts of disease, germs and
	poisons, He has created such effective antidotes that they have not
	yet been fully encompassed by human knowledge. If these natural
	arrangements had not been made, even a thorn-prick would have proved
	fatal. When this all-pervading mercy and providence of the Creator
	is supporting and sustaining man at all times in every way, there

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote59sym" HREF="#sdfootnote59anc">59</A>The
	third reason for worshiping none but Allah is that man's relation
	with his God is not merely confined to this worldly life, which will
	end at death, but extends to life-after-death also. The same God Who
	brought him into existence, recalls him and there is no power which
	can stop his return froth the world. No remedy, no physician no god
	or goddess has ever been able to catch the hand which takes man out
	of this world. Even all those men who were made deities and
	worshiped, could not ward off their own deaths. Only Allah judges
	and decides when a particular person is to be recalled from the
	world, and whenever somebody is recalled by Him, he has to leave
	this world in any case. Then it is Allah alone Who will decide as to
	when He should raise back to life all those people who were born in
	this world and died and buried here, and ask them to account for
	their worldly lives. Then also nobody will have the power to stop
	resurrection of himself or others. Every human being will have to
	rise on the Command of Allah and appear in His Court. Then Allah
	alone will be the Judge on that Day, and nobody else will be a
	partner in his judgment in any degree. To punish or to forgive will
	be entirely in Allah's hand. Nobody will have the power to get
	somebody forgiven if Allah would want to punish him, and punished if
	Allah would want to forgive him All those who are regarded as
	intercessors in the world, will themselves be hoping for Allah's
	mercy and grace for their forgiveness. In view of these facts
	anybody who worships others than Allah, is in fact preparing for his
	own doom. There can be no greater misfortune than this that man
	should turn away from Allah Who controls his life here as well as in
	the Hereafter, and should turn for help and support to those who are
	utterly powerless in this regard. &nbsp;

	people who rejected just one Prophet have been regarded as

	is the second of the two arguments of Prophet Noah about the truth
	of his message, the first being that they had known him as a
	trustworthy man during his earlier life, which he had lived among
	them. This second argument implies this: &quot;I do not have any
	selfish motive or personal interest in conveying the message which I
	am propagating day and night in spite of all sorts of opposition and
	antagonism from you. At least you should understand this that 1 am
	sincere in my invitation, and am presenting honestly only that which
	I believe to be the truth and in following which I see the true
	success and well-being of humanity at large. I have no personal
	motive in this that I should fabricate falsehood to fool the
	people.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These two
	arguments are among the most important arguments which the Qur'an
	has advanced repeatedly as proofs of the truthfulness of the
	Prophets, and which it presents as criterion for judging
	Prophethood. A man who before Prophethood has lived a life in a
	society and has always been found to be honest, truthful and
	righteous, cannot be doubted even by a prejudiced person that he
	would suddenly start fabricating falsehood in the name of Allah and
	making people believe that he has been appointed a Prophet by Him,
	whereas he has been not. More important than that: such a lie cannot
	be fabricated with a good intention unless somebody has a selfish
	motive attached to this kind of fraud. And even when a person
	indulges in this sort of fraud, he cannot hide it completely from
	the people. The foul means and devices adopted by him to promote his
	&quot;business&quot; become known and all the various selfish
	interests and gains become all too apparent. Contrary to this, the
	personal life of a Prophet is full of moral excellencies: it has no
	trace of the employment of foul means and devices. Not to speak of
	any personal interest, he expends whatever he has for the cause of a
	mission which to all appearances is fruitless. No person who
	possesses any common sense and also has a sense of justice, can ever
	imagine that a sensible man who was leading a perfectly peaceful
	life, would come out all of a sudden with a false claim, when such a
	false claim does not do him any good, but on the contrary, demands
	all his money, time and energy and earns him nothing in return but
	the antagonism and hostility of the whole world. Sacrifice of
	personal interests is the foremost proof of a man's sincerity;
	therefore, doubting the intentions and sincerity of a person who has
	been sacrificing his personal interests for years and years can only
	be the pastime of the one who himself is selfish and insincere.

	and ordinary workmen, or some youth who enjoyed no position in
	society. As for the influential and rich people, they had become his
	bitter opponents, and were trying by every trick and allurement to
	keep the common man behind them. One of the arguments they advanced
	against Prophet Noah was this: &quot;Had there been some weight and
	substance in Noah's message, the rich people, scholars, religious
	divines, nobles and wise people of the community should have
	accepted it, but none of them has believed in him; the only people

	for the common people, their being common was a proof that they
	lacked sense and judgment. As such, if a thing was accepted by them

	without worth and value. The disbelievers of Makkah even went
	further. They argued that a Prophet could not be a common man: if
	God had to appoint a Prophet, He would have appointed a great chief
	to be a Prophet: &quot;They say: why has not the Qur'an been sent

	Allah to tell the vain and arrogant disbelievers plainly that the
	poor believers could not be driven out of Islam just for their sake:
	&quot;O Muhammad, you attend earnestly to him who has shown
	indifference (to your message), whereas you have no responsibility

	That is why in Surah Fajr, the `Ad have been referred to as

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some of

	AI-Madinah and Tabuk, a few miles to the north of Al-'Ula
	(Wad-il-Qura of the Holy Prophet's time) in Hejaz. The local
	inhabitants call it AI-Hijr and Mada'in Salih even today. AI-'Ula is
	still a green and fertile valley abounding in water springs and
	gardens, but AI-Hijr appears to be an abandoned place. It has thin
	population, little greenery and a few wells one of which is said to
	be the one at which Prophet Salih's shecamel used to drink water.
	This well is now dry and located within a deserted military post of
	the time of the Turks. When we entered this territory and approached
	AI-'Ula, we found hills which seemed to have been shattered to
	pieces from top to bottom as if by a violent earthquake. (See
	pictures on the opposite pages). We saw the same kind of hills while
	travelling to the east, from AI-`Ula to Khaibar, for about 50 miles,
	and towards the north inside Jordan, for about 30 to 40 miles. This
	indicated that an area, stretching well over 300 to 400 miles in

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A few of

	at Madyan along the Gulf of 'Aqabah and at Petra in Jordan. At Petra
	specially the Thamudic and Nabataean works stand side by side, and
	their styles and architectural designs are so different that anyone
	who examines them will find that they were neither built in the same
	age nor by the same nation. (See pictures for contrast). Doughty,
	the British orientalist, in his attempt to prove the Qur'an as
	false, has claimed that the works found at Al-HIijr were not carved
	out by Thamud but by the Nabataeans. I am of the view that the art
	of carving houses out of the rocks started with the Thamud, and
	thousands of years later, in the second and first centuries B.C., it
	was considerably developed by the Nabataeans and it reached
	perfection in the works of the caves of Ellora, which were carved
	out about 700 years after Petra.&nbsp;

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The,
	hundreds of ruins found in the waste and uninhabited land lying to
	the south and east of the Dead Sea indicate that this must have been
	a prosperous and thickly populated area in the past. The
	archaeologists have estimated that the age of prosperity of this
	land lasted between 2300 and 1900 B.C. According to historians,
	Prophet Abraham lived about 2000 B C. Thus the archaeological
	evidence confirms that this land was destroyed in the time of
	Prophet Abraham and his nephew Prophet Lot. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The most
	populous and fertile part .of the area was &quot;the vale of Siddim&quot;
	as mentioned in the Bible: &quot;And Lot lifted up his eyes, and
	beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere,
	before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of
	the Lord, like the land of Egypt&quot; (Gen. 13 :10) The present day
	scholars are of the opinion that that valley is now under the Dead
	Sea and this opinion is supported by firm archaeological evidence.
	In the ancient times, the Dead Sea did not so much extend to the
	south as it does today. Opposite and to the west of the present
	Jordanian city of AI-Karak, there is a small peninsula called
	AI-Lisan. This was the end of the sea in ancient days. The area to
	the south of it, which is now under sea water (the shaded portion in
	the map) was a fertile valley, &quot;the vale of Siddim&quot;, in
	which were situated Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, Zoar, the famous
	cities of the people of Lot. In about 2000 B.C. this valley sank as
	a result of a violent earthquake and was submerged in sea water.
	Even today this is the most shallow part of the Sea. In the Roman
	period it was more so and was fordable from AI-Lisan to the western
	coast. One can still see submerged jungles along the southern coast
	and there might as well be submerged buildings.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to the Bible and the ancient Greek and Latin writings, the region
	abounded in pits of petroleum and asphalt and at places inflammable
	gas also existed. It appears from the geological observations that
	with the violent earthquake shocks, petroleum, gases and asphalt
	were thrown up and ignited, and the whole region exploded like a
	bomb. The Bible says that when Prophet Abraham got the news and went
	from Hebron to see the affected valley, he saw that &quot;the smoke
	of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.&quot; (Gen. 19:
	28).

	people of Aiykah have been briefly mentioned in vv. 78-84 of Surah
	AI-Hijr. More about them here. There is a difference of opinion
	among the commentators as to whether the Midianites and the people
	of Aiykah were two different tribes or one and the same people. One
	group holds that they were different tribes and gives the argument
	that in Surah Al-A'raf Prophet Shu'aib has been &quot;brother of the
	Midianites&quot; (v. RS), whereas here, with regard to the people
	of. Aiykah, he has not been called so. The other group holds that
	they were one and the same people on the ground that the moral
	discases and characteristics mentioned of the Midianites in SurahS
	AI-A'raf-and Hud are the same as of the people of Aiykah mentioned
	here. Then the message and admonition of Prophet Shu'aib to both the
	tribes was the same, and the two tribes also met the same end. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Research
	in this regard has shown that both the views are correct. The
	Midianites and the people' of Aiykah were doubtless two different
	tribes but branches of the same stock. The progeny of Prophet
	Abraham from his wife (or slave girl) Keturah, is well known in
	Arabia and in the history of the Israelites as the children of
	Keturah. Their most prominent branch was the one which became famous
	as the Midianites, after their ancestor, Midian, son of Abraham.
	They had settled in the territory between northern Arabia and
	southern Palestine, and along the coasts of the Red Sea and the Gulf
	of 'Aqabah. Their capital city was Madyan, which was situated,
	according to Abul Fida, on the western coast of the Gulf of 'Aqabah
	at five days' journey from Aiykah (present-day 'Aqabah). The rest of
	the children of Keturah, among whom the Dedanites are comparatively
	better known, settled in the territory between Taima and Tabuk and
	AI-'Ula in northern Arabia, their main city being Tabuk, the Aiykah
	of the ancient tithes. (Yaqut in his Mu'jam al-Buldan, under Aiykah,
	writes that this is the old name of Tabuk, and the natives of Tabuk
	confirm this). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	reason why one and the same Prophet was sent to the Midianites and
	the people of Aiykah was probably that both the tribes were
	descendants of the same ancestors, spoke the same language and had
	settled in the adjoining areas. It is just possible that they lived
	side by side in the same areas and had marriage and other social
	relations between them. Then, these two branches were traders by
	profession and had developed similar evil practices and social and
	moral weaknesses. According to the early books of the Bible, these
	people worshiped Baal-peor. When the Children of Israel came out of
	Egypt and entered their territory, they also became infected with
	the evils of idolatry and adultery. (Numbers, 25: 1-5, 31: 16-17).
	Then those people had settled on the two main international trade
	routes, the one joining Yaman with Syria and the other the Persian
	Gulf with Egypt. Due to their advantageous position they had started
	big scale highway robbery and would not let any caravan pass till it
	had paid heavy taxes. They had thus rendered these trade routes
	highly unsafe. Their characteristic of highway robbery has been
	mentioned in the Qur'an, for which they were admonished through
	Prophet Shu'aib, thus: &quot;And do not lie in ambush by every path
	(of life) as robbers in order to frighten the people&quot;
	(AI-A'raf: 86). These were the reasons why Allah sent to both the
	tribes the same Prophet, who conveyed to them the same teachings and
	message. For the details of the story of Prophet Shu'aib and the
	Midianites, see A1-A'raf: 85-93, Hud: 8495, Al'Ankabut 36-37.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Among
	other arguments this verse also is quoted in support of Imam Abu
	Hanifah's early opinion that if a person recites the translation of
	the Qur'an in the prayer, his prayer will be in order and valid,
	whether he is able to recite the Qur'an in Arabic or not. According
	to `Allama Abu Bakr al-Jassas, the basis of this argument is: &quot;Allah
	says that the Qur'an was contained in the former Scriptures also;
	obviously this could not be in Arabic words, As such, if translated
	and presented in another language, it will still be the Qur'an.&quot;
	(Ahkam-ul-Qur'an, Vol. III, p. 429). But the weakness of this
	argument is obvious. The Qur'an, or any other Divine Book, was never
	revealed in a manner that Allah inspired the Prophet with its
	meaning and then he presented it before the people in his own words.
	The fact is that every Book, in whatever language it came, was
	revealed in Divine words and meanings together. As such, the
	teachings of the Qur'an were contained in the former Scriptures in
	Divine words and not in human, and none of their translations could
	be considered as the Divine Book or its representation. As regards
	the Qur'an, it has been stated over and over again that it was
	literally revealed in the Arabic language: &quot;We have sent it
	down as Qur'an in Arabic&quot;. (Yusuf: 2). &quot;We have sent this
	Command in Arabic to you.&quot; (Ar-Ra'd: 37). &quot;An Arabic
	Qur'an without any crookedness.&quot; (Az-Zumar: 28). Then just
	before this verse, it has been said that the trustworthy Spirit has
	brought it down in Arabic. Now how can it be said that the
	translation of the Qur'an made into another language will also be
	the Qur'an and its words will represent the words of Allah? It
	appears that later the Imam himself felt this weakness in the
	argument and, according to authentic traditions, gave up his earlier
	opinion, and adopted the opinion of Imams Abu Yusuf and Muhammad,
	who held that a person who could not recite Arabic words, could
	recite the translation of the Qur'an in his prayer till he was able
	to pronounce Arabic words. However, the prayer of a person, who was
	able to recite the Qur'an in Arabic, would not be valid if he
	recited its translation. The fact is that the two Imams had
	proposed, this concession only for those non-Arab converts who were
	not able to offer their prayer in Arabic immediately after embracing
	Islam. In this the basis of their argument was not that the
	translation of the Qur'an was the Qur'an itself, but that just as a
	person unable to perform Ruku' and Sajdah was allowed to offer his
	prayer by making signs, so a person unable to pronounce Arabic words
	could recite the translation. Then just as the prayer of a person
	who offered it by making signs could not be valid as soon as the
	cause of inability was removed, so the prayer of a person who
	recited the translation would not be valid as soon as he became able
	to pronounce Arabic words. (For a detailed discussion, see Al-Mabsut
	by Sarkhasi,Vol. I, p. 37; Fath ul-Qadir and Sharh Inaya

	revelation of these verses a deputation of 20 men, who had been
	influenced by the preaching of Hadrat Ja'far, came to Makkah from
	Habash. They met the Holy Prophet in Masjid al-Haram and asked him
	in the presence of the unbelieving Quraish what his teachings were.
	In response, the Holy Prophet recited a few verses of the Qur'an,
	whereupon tears came down from their eyes and they believed in him
	there and then to be a true Messenger of Allah. When they took leave
	of the Holy Prophet, Abu Jahl met them along with a few other men of
	the Quraish and rebuked them, saying, &quot;Never has a more stupid
	company come here before: O foolish men, you were sent here by your
	people with a view to inquiring about this man, but no sooner did
	you meet him than you gave up your own faith!&quot; &quot;those
	gentle people did not like to have a dispute with Abu Jahl, so they

	you: you are responsible for your faith and we are for ours: we
	adopted something in which we saw some good for ourselves.&quot;
	(Vol II, p. 32). This same incident has been mentioned in Surah
	Qasas, thus:&quot;Those to whom We had given the Book before this,
	believe in the Qur'an and when it is recited to them, they say, 'We
	have believed in it: this is the very Truth from our Lord: we were

	You are warned to beware and save yourselves from the torment of the
	Hell-Fire: I cannot protect you from Allah's punishment; you may,

	Then as was the custom in Arabia, to warn the people of an impending

	&quot;O people of Quraish, O children of Ka`b bin Luayy, O children
	of Murrah, O children of Qasayy, O children of 'Abd Manaf, O
	children of 'Abd Shams, O children of Hashim, O children of `Abdul
	Muttalib....&quot;, and in this way he called out each branch and
	clan of the Quraish by name. When all the people had got together,
	he said, &quot;O People, if 1 tell you that on the other side of
	this hill, there is a huge army ready to attack you, will you
	believe my word?&quot; With one voice they replied in the
	affirmative, saying that they had never heard a lie from him in the
	past. Thereupon the Holy Prophet said, &quot;Well, I warn you of the
	impending scourge of Allah: save yourselves from His punishment: I
	cannot be of any help to you against Him. On the Day of
	Resurrection, the righteous only will be nearest to me. Let it not

	for help, but I shall be constrained to turn my face away from you.

	matter was not simply this that on receipt of the Command to &quot;warn
	your nearest kinsfolk&quot;, the Holy Prophet called together all
	his relatives and complied with it. In fact, the principle it meant
	to stress was that in the matter of religion the Prophet and his
	relations enjoyed no special privilege of which the other people
	might be deprived. What was harmful for one man, was harmful for
	everybody. The Prophet was supposed to first protect himself from
	this and then warn his nearest kinsfolk and the common people of its
	fatal consequences. On the other hand, what was good and beneficial
	for one man, 'was good and beneficial for all. As. such, the Prophet
	should first adopt it himself and then exhort his relatives also to
	adopt it, so that everybody may see that the Prophet dces not only
	preach his message to others but practices it himself also
	sincerely. The Holy Prophet followed this principle throughout his
	life. On the conquest of Makkah, when he entered the city, he

	'Abbas traded money on interest, and a substantial amount of
	interest payable to him at that time was outstanding against the
	people). Once the Holy Prophet ordered cutting off of the hand of a
	Quraishite woman, named Fatimah, on the charge of theft. Hadrat
	Usamah bin Zaid came to intercede for her, whereupon the Holy
	Prophet said: &quot;By God, even if Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad,
	had committed the theft, I would have ordered amputation of her
	hand, too.&quot;</P>

	is, the people who follow and accompany the poets, are wholly
	different in, their characteristics, habits and temper from those
	who follow and accompany Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace). The
	difference between the two groups is so obvious that one group can
	be easily distinguished from the other. On the one side, there are
	the people who are characterized by the high seriousness, civilized
	and gentle behavior, righteousness and fear of God, sense of
	responsibility and a high regard for the rights of others; people
	who are fair and just in their dealings, . who do not utter a word
	except in the cause of goodness, who have a high and pure ideal
	before them, which they pursue with single-minded devotion and for
	whose attainment they expend all their energies and capabilities. On
	other side, there are the people whose only pastime is to portray
	erotic scenes of love and wine-drinking, mocking and jesting,
	satirizing and eulogizing, or to arouse feelings of hatred and
	enmity and vengeance against others, or to describe charms of
	unchaste women to the brothel or of chaste ladies in the houses,
	only for the sake of pleasing the people and winning their applause.
	From the crowds who throng the poetic sessions and follow the
	&quot;famous&quot; poets, one cannot help forming the impression
	that those people are free from every moral restriction, who have no
	object in life except to gratify the lusts of the flesh like
	animals, and who have no idea whatever of the higher and nobler
	ideals and ends of life. The person who cannot see the obvious
	difference between the two types is indeed blind. But if in spite of
	seeing and knowing the difference, only for the purpose of
	suppressing the Truth, he says that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's

	followers, he is not only a liar but has also transgressed all

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote143sym" HREF="#sdfootnote143anc">143</A>That
	is, they follow no fixed pattern for their thought and speech. but
	wander aimlessly in every valley. Every new impulse makes them take
	up a new theme regardless as to whether it has any truth in it or
	not. Under one momentary impulse they would start uttering wise
	things; under another they would give expression to filthy and base
	feelings. If they felt pleased with somebody, they would exaggerate
	his praises, and if they felt offended by him, they would condemn
	him and run him down to hell. If they had a selfish motive, attached
	with somebody, they would feel no hesitation in giving preference to
	a miserly person over a generous person and to a cowardly person
	over a gallant person. On the contrary, if they felt displeased with
	somebody, they would not feel any shame in blotting his character
	and ridiculing him and his ancestors. That is why, one can tied
	God-worship and atheism, materialism and spiritualism, morality and
	immorality, piety and filthiness, seriousness and jesting, eulogy
	and satire expressed side by side in the poetry of one and the same
	poet. A person who is aware of these well known characteristics of
	the poets cannot reconcile himself to charging the recipient of the
	Qur'an with poetry, whose every discourse and word is clear and
	precise, whose objective is clearly defined, and who has never in
	his life uttered a word deviating in any way from the path of truth,
	righteousness and virtue. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">At
	another place in the Qur'an, it has been stated that poetry is not
	suited to the temperament of the Holy Prophet: &quot;We have not
	taught him poetry, nor does it suit him.&quot; (Ya Sin: 69). And
	this fact was fully known to the people who had any personal
	acquaintance with the Holy Prophet. Authentic Traditions show that
	he could not recite a complete verse from memory. If ever during
	conversation he remembered of a good verse of some poet, he would
	recite it without much care and regard for its meter and order of
	words. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Once
	Hadrat `A'ishah was asked whether the Holy Prophet ever made use of
	poetic verses in his discourses. She replied that he hated poetic
	verses the most, though sometimes he would recite a verse of a poet
	of Bani Quais, but in so doing he would unconsciously change the
	order of its words. When Hadrat Abu Bakr corrected him, he would
	say, &quot;Brother, I am not a poet, nor composing poetry is my
	object. &quot; Arabic poetry abounded in themes of sex and love
	romances, wine drinking, tribal hatreds and feuds, ancestry pride
	and vanity and made little or no mention of pure and noble themes.
	It was so saturated with falsehood, exaggeration, false accusations,
	undue praise , vanity, satiric invectives, jesting and polytheistic
	obscenities that the Holy Prophet once remarked: &quot;It is better
	that the interior of one of you be filled with pus than with poetic
	verses&quot; However, if there was something good in a verse, he
	would appreciate it, and say, &quot;Some verses are based on
	wisdom.&quot; When he heard the verses of Umayyah bin Abi-Salt, he
	said, &quot;His verse is a believer but his heart a disbeliever.&quot;
	Once a Companion recited a hundred or so good verses before him, and
	he went on urging him to recite more.

	said what he practiced and practiced what he said. The fact that
	there was complete conformity between his word and deed, could not
	be denied by anybody. On the contrary, everyone was well aware that
	the poets said one thing and practiced just the opposite of it. For
	instance, they would express noble themes of generosity,
	indifference to worldly wealth, contentment and self-respect in
	their poetry, but, in practical life, they would turn out to be

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote145sym" HREF="#sdfootnote145anc">145</A>Here
	those poets have made an exception from the general reproach, who
	possess the following four characteristics: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) They
	should be believers in Allah, His Prophets, His Books and the
	Hereafter.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) They
	should be pious in practical life and not sinners, nor free from
	moral restrictions to say whatever they like. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) They
	should be remembering Allah much in their day to day lives as well
	as in their literary work. It should not be so that their personal
	lives reflect God-consciousness and piety, but their poetry is
	replete with themes of debauchery and lusts of the flesh, or that
	their poetry is full of serious themes of wisdom and
	God-consciousness, but their personal lives are devoid of any trace
	of the remembrance of Allah. As a matter of fact, both these states
	are equally despicable. A good poet is he who is God conscious in
	his personal life and whose poetic talent and skills also are
	devoted to the advancement of the way of life followed by the
	God-conscious, God-fearing and God-worshiping people. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) They
	should not satirize others for personal reasons, nor take vengeance
	on others on account of personal, racial and national prejudices,
	but when they are required to support the truth, they should use
	their literary powers like weapons of war against the unjust and
	treacherous people. It does not behoove the believers to adopt a
	humble, supplicating attitude against injustice and oppression.
	Traditions show that when the unbelieving and mushrik poets raised a
	storm of false accusations against Islam and the Holy Prophet and
	spread the poison of hatred against the Muslims, the Holy Prophet
	urged and encouraged the poets of Islam to counter attack them. Once
	he said to Ka`b bin Malik, &quot;Satirize them, for, I swear by God
	in Whose hand is my soul, your verse will be more effective and
	damaging for them than the arrow. &quot; Likewise he said to Hassan
	bin Thabit, &quot;Deal with them and Gabriel is with you&quot;. And,
	&quot;Say and the Holy Spirit is with you.&quot; Once he said, &quot;The
	believer fights with the sword as well as with the tongue. &quot;&nbsp;
