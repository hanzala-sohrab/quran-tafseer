period of the revelation of this Surah is determined absolutely by
the historical event that has been mentioned at the outset. It says:
&quot;The Romans have been vanquished in the neighboring land.&quot;In
those days the Byzantine occupied territories adjacent to Arabia were
Jordan, Syria and Palestine, and in these territories the Romans were
completely overpowered by the Iranians in 615 A. D. Therefore, it can
be said with absolute certainty that this Surah was sent down in the
same year, and this was the year in which the migration to Habash
took place. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
prediction made in the initial verses of this Surah is one of the
most outstanding evidences of the Quran's being the Word of Allah and
the Holy Prophet Muhammad's being a true Messenger of Allah. Let us
have a look at the historical background relevant to the verses. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Eight
years before the Holy Prophet's advent as a Prophet the Byzantine
Emperor Maurice was overthrown by Phocus, who captured the throne and
became king. Phocus first got the Emperor's five sons executed in
front of him, and then got the Emperor also killed and hung their
heads in a thoroughfare in Constantinople. A few days after this he
had the empress and her three daughters also put to death. The event
provided Khusrau Parvez, the Sassanid king of Iran; a good moral
excuse to attack Byzantium. For Emperor Maurice had been his
benefactor; with his help he had got the throne of Iran. Therefore,
he declared that he would avenge his godfather's and his children's
murder upon Phocus, the usurper. So, he started war against Byzantium
in 603 A. D. and within a few years, putting the Phocus armies to
rout in succession, he reached Edessa (modern, Urfa) in Asia Minor,
on the one hand, and Aleppo and Antioch in Syria, on the other. When
the Byzantine ministers saw that Phocus could not save the country,
they sought the African governor's help, who sent his son, Heraclius,
to Constantinople with a strong fleet. Phocus was immediately deposed
and Heraclius made emperor. He treated Phocus as he had treated
Maurice. This happened in 610 A. D., the year the Holy Prophet was
appointed to Prophethood. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
moral excuse for which Khusrau Parvez had started the war was no more
valid after the deposition and death of Phocus. Had the object of his
war really been to avenge the murder of his ally on Phocus for his
cruelty, he would have come to terms with the new Emperor after the
death of Phocus. But he continued the war, and gave it the color of a
crusade between Zoroastrianism and Christianity. The sympathies of
the Christian sects (i. e. Nestorians and Jacobians, etc.) which had
been excommunicated by the Roman ecclesiastical authority and
tyrannized for years also went with the Magian (Zoroastrian)
invaders, and the Jews also joined hands with them; so much so that
the number of the Jews who enlisted in Khusrau's army rose up to
26,000. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Heraclius
could not stop this storm. The very first news that he received from
the East after ascending the throne was that of the Iranian
occupation of Antioch. After this Damascus fell in 613 A. D. Then in
614 A.D. the Iranians occupying Jerusalem played havoc with the
Christian world. Ninety thousand Christians were massacred and the
Holy Sepulcher was desecrated. The Original Cross on which, according
to the Christian belief, Jesus had died was seized and carried to
Mada'in. The chief priest Zacharia was taken prisoner and all the
important churches of the city were destroyed. How puffed up was
Khusrau Parvez at this victory can be judged from the letter that he
wrote to Heraclius from Jerusalem. He wrote: &quot;From Khusrau, the
greatest of all gods, the master of the whole world: To Heraclius,
his most wretched and most stupid servant: You say that you have
trust in your Lord. why didn't then your Lord save Jerusalem from
me?&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Within
a year after this victory the Iranian armies over-ran Jordan,
Palestine and the whole of the Sinai Peninsula, and reached the
frontiers of Egypt. In those very days another conflict of a far
greater historical consequence was going on in Makkah. The believers
in One God, under the leadership of the Prophet Muhammad (may Allah's
peace be upon him), were fighting for their existence against the
followers of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">shirk</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">under the command of the chiefs of the
Quraish, and the conflict had reached such a stage that in 615 A. D.,
a substantial number of the Muslims had to leave their homes and take
refuge with the Christian kingdom of Habash, which was an ally of the
Byzantine Empire. In those days the Sassanid victories against
Byzantium were the talk of the town, and the pagans of Makkah were
delighted and were taunting the Muslims to the effect: &quot;Look the
fire worshipers of Iran are winning victories and the Christian
believers in Revelation and Prophethood are being routed everywhere.
Likewise, we, the idol worshipers of Arabia, will exterminate you and
your religion.&quot; </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These
were the conditions when this Surah of the Quran was sent down, and
in it a prediction was made, saying:&quot;The Romans have been
vanquished in the neighboring land and within a few years after their
defeat, they shall be victorious. And it will be the day when the
believers will rejoice in the victory granted by Allah.&quot; It
contained not one but two predictions: First, the Romans shall be
victorious; and second, the Muslims also shall win a victory at the
same time. Apparently, there was not a remote chance of the
fulfillment of the either prediction in the next few years. On the
one hand, there were a handful of the Muslims, who were being beaten
and tortured in Makkah, and even till eight years after this
prediction there appeared no chance of their victory and domination.
On the other, the Romans were losing more and more ground every next
day. By 619 A. D. the whole of Egypt had passed into Sassanid hands
and the Magian armies had reached as far as Tripoli. In Asia Minor
they beat and pushed back the Romans to Bosporus, and in 617 A. D.
they captured Chalcedon (modern, Kadikoy) just opposite
Constantinople. The Emperor sent an envoy to Khusrau, praying that he
was ready to have peace on any terms, but he replied, &quot;I shall
not give protection to the emperor until he is brought in chains
before me and gives up obedience to his crucified god and adopts
submission to the fire god.&quot; At last, the Emperor became so
depressed by defeat that he decided to leave Constantinople and shift
to Carthage (modern, Tunis). In short, as the British historian
Gibbon says, even seven to eight years after this prediction of the
Quran, the conditions were such that no one could even imagine that
the Byzantine Empire would ever gain an upper hand over Iran. Not to
speak of gaining domination, no one could hope that the Empire, under
the circumstances, would even survive. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

622 A. D. as the Holy Prophet migrated to Madinah, the Emperor
Heraclius set off quietly for Trabzon from Constantinople via the
Black Sea and started preparations to attack Iran from rear. For this
he asked the Church for money, and Pope Sergius lent him the Church
collections on interest, in a bid to save Christianity from
Zoroastrianism. Heraclius started his counter attack in 623 A. D.
from Armenia. Next year, in 624 A. D., he entered Azerbaijan and
destroyed Clorumia, the birthplace of Zoroaster, and ravaged the
principal fire temple of Iran. Great are the powers of Allah, this
was the very year when the Muslims achieved a decisive victory at
Badr for the first time against the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">mushriks</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
Thus both the predictions made in Surah Rum were fulfilled
simultaneously within the stipulated period of ten years. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
Byzantine forces continued to press the Iranians hard and in the
decisive battle at Nineveh (627 A.D.) they dealt them the hardest
blow. They captured the royal residence of Dastagerd, and then
pressing forward reached right opposite to Ctesiphon, capital of Iran
in those days. In 628 A. D. in an internal revolt, Khusrau Parvez was
imprisoned and 18 of his sons were executed in front of him and a few
days later he himself died in the prison. This was the year when the
peace treaty of Hudaibiya was concluded, which the Quran has termed
as &quot;the supreme victory&quot;, and in this very year Khusrau's
son, Qubad II, gave up all the occupied Roman territories, restored
the True Cross and made peace with Byzantium. In 628 A. D., the
Emperor himself went to Jerusalem to install the &quot;Holy Cross&quot;
in its place, and in the same year the Holy Prophet entered Makkah
for the first time after the Hijrah to perform the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">`Umra-tul-Qada'</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">.

this no one could have any doubt about the truth of the prophecy of
the Quran, with the result that most of the Arab polytheists accepted
Islam. The heirs of Ubayy bin Khalaf lost their bet and had to give a
hundred camels to Hadrat Abu Bakr Siddiq. He took them before the
Holy Prophet, who ordered that they be given away in charity, because
the bet had been made at a time when gambling had not yet been
forbidden by the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Shari`ah</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">;

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This

seeing only what is apparent and superficial. That which is behind
the apparent and superficial he does not know. When in the petty

can lead man to misunderstandings and miscalculations, and when he is
liable to make wrong estimates only due to lack of knowledge about
&quot;what will happen tomorrow&quot;, how stupendous will be his

conclusion, a parable has been presented to make the people
understand that just as dead earth comes to life, all of a sudden, by
a shower of rain sent by God and swells with vegetation and plant
life, so is the case with the dead humanity. When God sends a shower
of His mercy in the form of Revelation and Prophethood, it also gives
a new life to mankind and causes it to grow and develop and flourish.
Therefore: &quot;If you take full advantage of this opportunity, the
barren land of Arabia will bloom by Allah's mercy and the whole
advantage will be your. But if you do not take advantage of it, you
will harm only your selves. Then no regret will avail and no

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>From
	what lbn `Abbas and the other Companions and their followers have
	said, it appears that the Muslims' sympathies in this war between
	Byzantium and Iran were with Byzantium and of the disbelievers of
	Makkah with Iran. This had several reasons. First, the Iranians had
	given it the colour of a crusade between Magianism and Christianity,
	and, apart from the object of political conquest, they were making
	it a means of spreading Magianism. In the letter that Khusrau Parvez
	wrote to the Emperor Heraclius after the conquest of Jerusalem, he
	had clearly mentioned his victory as a proof of the truth of
	Magianism. In principle, the Magian creed resembled the polytheistic
	creed of the people of Makkah, because the Magis too, were
	disbelievers of Tauhid they believed in two gods and worshiped the
	fire. That is why the mushriks of Makkah were in sympathy with them.
	Contrary to them, the Christians, however corrupted their monotheism
	might be, still regarded belief in One God as the basis of religion,
	believed in the Hereafter and admitted Revelation and Prophethood as
	the source of guidance. Thus, their religion in principle resembled
	Islam, and therefore, the Muslims were naturally in sympathy with
	them, and could not like that a polytheistic people should dominate
	them. Secondly, the people who believe in a previous Prophet before
	the advent of a new Prophet are naturally regarded and counted as
	Muslims until the message of the new Prophet reaches them and they
	clearly discard it. (Please see E.N. 73 of Surah AI-Qasas also). At
	that time only five to six years had passed since the Holy Prophet's
	advent as a Prophet and his message had not yet reached outside
	Arabia. Therefore, the Muslims did not look upon the Christians as
	disbelievers, but they certainly regarded the Jews as disbelievers
	because they had rejected the Prophet Jesus (may peace be upon him)
	to be a Prophet. Thirdly, the Christians from the very beginning had
	been treating the Muslims with sympathy as already mentioned above
	in Al-Qasas: 52-55, and in AI-Ma'idah: 82-85, and many of them were
	even accepting the message of the Truth with an open heart. Then,
	the way the Christian king of Habash had given refuge to the Muslims
	on their migration there and turned down the demand of the
	disbelievers of Makkah to return them, also required that the
	Muslims should wish the Christians well as against the Magians.

	these people had reflected over their own selves, apart from the
	external phenomena, they would have found in themselves the
	arguments which prove the necessity of a second life after the
	present life. There are three special characteristics of man which
	distinguish him from the other creations on the earth: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">( l ) The
	earth and the countless things around it have been subjected for
	him, and he has been granted vast powers to exploit them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) He
	has been life free to choose a way of life for himself. He can
	follow the way of belief or disbelief, obedience or sin, virtue or
	vice, as he likes. Any way of life, right or wrong, that he chooses,
	he is helped to follow it and allowed to use and exploit all the
	means and resources provided by God, whether the way chosen is of
	God's obedience or of His disobedience. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) An
	innate moral sense has been placed in him, by which he discriminates
	between the voluntary and the involuntary actions; he judges the
	voluntary acts as good and bad, and decides spontaneously that a
	good act ought to he rewarded and an evil act ought to be punished. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These
	three characteristics which are found in man's own self serve as a
	pointer to the fact that there must be a time when man should he
	called to account for his deeds, when he should be asked how he used
	the powers delegated to him over what he had been given in the
	world, when it should be seen whether he had adopted the right way
	or the wrong way by use of the freedom of choice given to him, when
	his voluntary acts should be judged, and good acts be rewarded and
	evil acts punished. This time inevitably can come only after man's
	life-activity has ceased and the account-book of his actions closed,
	and not before it. And this time should necessarily come only when
	the account-book of not one man or of one nation but of all mankind
	has closed. For on the passing away of one man or of one nation the
	influence that he or it has generated by his or its acts does not
	cease to operate. The good or bad influence left by him should also
	be credited to his account. How can accountability be carried out
	and full rewards and punishments given with justice unless the
	influences are allowed to run their full course'' Thus, man's own
	self testifies that the position he occupies in the world by itself
	demands that after his present life there should be another life
	when a Court should be established, his life-record examined justly
	and every person rewarded or punished according to his deeds. &nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote6">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote6sym" HREF="#sdfootnote6anc">6</A>In
	this sentence, two more arguments have been given for the Hereafter.
	It says that if man makes a deep observation of the system of the
	universe, he will see two things very outstanding about it: First,
	that the universe has been created with the truth. It is not a
	plaything of a child, which he might have made to amuse himself, and
	whose making and un-making might be meaningless. But it is a serious
	system whose every particle testifies that it has been created with
	great wisdom, its each component has a law underlying it, and
	everything in it has a purpose behind it. Man's whole social and
	economic life and all his sciences and arts are a witness that
	whatever man has done in the world became possible only because he
	was able to discover the laws working behind everything and the
	purpose for which it was made. Had he been placed as a puppet in a
	lawless and purposeless toy-house, no science and no civilization
	and social life could be conceived. Now, how does it stand to reason
	that the Wise Being Who has created this world with such wisdom and
	design and Who has placed in it a creation like man, who is endowed
	with great mental and physical capabilities, powers and authority,
	freedom of action and choice, moral sense and entrusted with
	unlimited means and resources of the world, would have created him
	without a purpose and design ? That man would live a full life
	involving both goodness and evil, justice and injustice, virtue and
	vice, and end up in the dust, and his good and evil acts will not
	bear any fruit ? That each act of man will influence his own life as
	well as the lives of thousands of other men like himself and
	countless other things in the world, for good or for evil, and the
	whole record of his life-activity will be just set aside after his
	death, without accountability? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	thing that becomes apparent after a deep observation of the system
	of the universe is that nothing here is immortal. Everything has an
	age . appointed for it after attaining which it dies and expires,
	and the same is the case with the universe as a whole. AII the
	forces that are working here are limited. They can work only till an
	appointed term and they have inevitably to run out in time, and this
	system has to end. In the ancient days the philosophers and
	scientists who said that the world was eternal and everlasting could
	have their way, due mainly to lack of knowledge. But modern science
	almost definitely has cast its vote in favor of the God-worshipers
	in the debate that had been going on since centuries between them
	and the atheists regarding the eternal and the temporal nature of
	the world. Now the atheists are left with no leg to stand on. They
	cannot claim on the basis of reason and knowledge that the world has
	existed since eternity and will exist for ever and there is going to
	be no resurrection. The ancient materialistic creed rested on the
	belief that matter was indestructible, only its form could be
	changed, but after every change matter remained matter and no
	increase or decrease occurred in its quantity. Therefore, it was
	inferred that this material world had neither a beginning nor an
	end. But now the discovery of the atomic energy has demolished the
	entire materialistic edifice. Now it has come to light that energy
	changes into matter, and matter changes back into energy with the
	result that nothing persists, neither form nor appearance. The
	Second Law of Thermodynamics has proved that this material world has
	neither existed since eternity nor will last till eternity. It
	certainly began in time and has to end in time. Therefore, it is no
	longer possible to deny the Hereafter even according to science. And
	obviously, when science has surrendered, how will philosophy stand
	to deny the Hereafter?</P>

	is an historical argument for the Hereafter. It means this: &quot;The
	Hereafter has not been denied only by a couple of the people in the
	world, but a large number of them have been involved in this
	disbelief in human history. Even there have been entire nations
	which either denied it altogether or lived heedless of it, or
	invented such false beliefs about life-after-death as rendered the
	concept of the Hereafter meaningless. Then the continuous experience
	of history reveals that in whatever form the Hereafter has been
	denied, its inevitable result has been that the people became
	corrupted morally, they lived irresponsible lives they transgressed
	all limits of tyranny and wickedness, which became the cause of the
	destruction of one nation after the other. Does not this experience
	of thousands of years of history, which has been faced by human
	generations successively, prove that the Hereafter is a reality
	whose denial is fatal to man? Man has come to believe in gravitation
	only because he has always experienced and seen material things
	falling to the ground. He has recognized poison to be poison only
	because whoever took poison died. Similarly, when the denial of the
	Hereafter has always Ied to the corruption of morals for man, is not
	this experience enough to teach the lesson that the Hereafter is a
	reality, and to live one's life heedless of it is dangerous? &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The first
	of these verses tells that the times of the Prayer are from the
	declining of the sun to the darkness of the night (`Isha`) after
	which is the time of the morning Prayer (Fajr). In the second verse,
	the `&quot;two ends of the day&quot; imply the times of the morning
	(Fajr) and the evening (Maghrib) Prayers, and &quot;in the early

	the Qur'an at different places has pointed to the five Prayer times
	at which the Muslims the world over offer their Prayers. But,

	prescribed by the Qur'an. They assert that the Qur'anic injunction
	to establish the Salat does not mean the offering of the Prayer but
	establishing the Nizam-i-Rububiyat(Order of Providence). Ask them:
	&quot;What is that order of Providence which can either be
	established before the rising of the sun or after the declining of
	the sun till the early hours of the night? And what is that order of
	Providence which is required to be established especially on
	Fridays? (&quot;O believers when you hear the call to the Friday
	Prayer, hasten to the remembrance of Allah&quot;.--(LXII: 9). And
	what is that special kind of the order of Providence for
	establishing which one has first to wash one's face and the hands up
	to the elbows and the feet up to the ankles and wipe one's head with
	wet hands, otherwise one will not establish it ? ( &quot;O
	believers, when you stand up to offer the Salat, you must wash your
	faces and your hands and arms up to the elbows, and wipe your heads
	with wet hands.&quot;--(V: 6). And what is this peculiarity of this
	order of Providence that one cannot establish it unless one has
	completely washed oneself after sexual intercourse? (&quot;O
	believers, do not offer the Prayer . . . if you are unclean until
	you take your bath, except when passing on the way.&quot;--(IV: 433)
	And what is this odd thing that if one has touched the women, one
	will have to strike one's hands on pure dust and wipe thereby one's
	face and hands in case one does not find water, for the purpose of
	establishing this strange order of Providence ? (&quot;... or if you
	have touched women and you can find no water, then cleanse
	yourselves with pure dust: strike your palms on it and wipe your
	Bands and faces with it.&quot;--(1V: 43). And what is this amazing
	order of Providence that while on a journey one should establish
	only half of it? (&quot;When you go on a journey, there is no harm
	if you shorten the Salat. &quot;--(IV : 101) Then, what an odd thing
	that during a war half of the soldiers should fall out,.carrying
	their weapons, in order to' establish the order of Providence behind
	the Imam, and the other half should stick to their positions and
	continue fighting the enemy; when the first group has performed one
	sajdah behind the Imam in its effort to establish the &quot;order of
	Providence&quot; it should go to relieve the other group, which
	should fall out and start establishing the &quot;order of
	Providence&quot; behind the Imam? (&quot;And when you, O Prophet,
	are among the Muslims and are going to lead them in salat (in a
	state of war), let a party of them stand behind you, carrying their
	weapons with thetas. When they have made their prostrations, they
	should fall back, and let another party of them, who have not yet
	offered their Salat say it with you. &quot;--(IV 102)

	implies the Prayer that the Muslims offer everywhere in the world

	Qur'an instead of changing themselves. The fact is that unless a
	person becomes wholly fearless of Allah, he cannot dare play with
	His Word as these people do. Or, only such a person can engage in a
	pastime like this with respect to the Qur'an who believes it is not

	seek bounty&quot; is to seek the livelihood. Though man generally
	sleeps at night and works for his living in the day, this is not a
	law. Many people also sleep in the day and work for their livelihood
	at night. That is why the night and the day both have been mentioned
	and it has been said: &quot;In both day and nights you sleep as well
	as work for your livelihood. &quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This also
	is a Sign which points to the design of the Wise Creator:
	Furthermore, it also points to the fact that He is not merely a
	Creator but also extremely Compassionate and Merciful to His
	creations, and is more anxious than the creation to meet its needs
	and requirements. Man cannot constantly labor but needs to have a
	rest of a few hours after every few hours of hard work so as to
	rebuild energy to take up work again. For this purpose, the Wise and
	Merciful Creator has not rested content with creating a feeling of
	fatigue and a desire for rest in man, but has placed in his nature a
	powerful urge for the &quot;sleep&quot;, which without his will,
	even in spite of resistance from him, overpowers him automatically
	after every few hours of work and wakefulness, and compels him to
	have a few hours of rest, and leaves him as soon as the need has
	been fulfilled. Man has so far been unable to understand the nature
	and real causes of the sleep. This is something wholly innate, which
	has been placed in the nature and structure of man. Its being`
	precisely according to the requirements of man is enough to testify
	that it is not anything accidental, but has been provided by a Wise
	Being in accordance with a purpose and plan. It is based on a clear
	wisdom and reason and purposefulness. Moreover, the sleep itself
	testifies that the One Who has placed this compulsive urge in man is
	a greater well wisher of man than man himself, otherwise man would
	have deliberately resisted the sleep and endeavored to keep
	constantly awake and worked continuously hard and thus exhaust not
	only his work-power but also his vital powers.

	using the word &quot;seeking Allah's bounty&quot; for the seeking of
	livelihood, allusion has been made to another series of the Signs.
	How could have man sought and found his `livelihood if the
	innumerable and unlimited forces of the earth and heavens had not
	been put to work to provide means of the livelihood and supply
	countless resources for man to seek it in the earth? Not only this.
	Man could not have exploited these means and resources had he not
	been given appropriate limbs and suitable physical and mental
	capabilities for the purpose. Thus the ability in man to seek the
	livelihood and the presence of the resources of the livelihood
	outside of him, clearly indicate the existence of a Merciful and
	Beneficent God. An intellect which is not sick can never presume
	that all this has happened by chance, or is the manifestation of the
	godhead of many gods, or some merciless, blind force is responsible
	for these bounties and blessings. &nbsp;

	turning to Allah and having fear of His wrath are the acts of the
	heart. This state of the heart, for its manifestation and stability,
	inevitably needs a physical act, which they make it known to others
	in society that so-and-so has really returned to the service of One
	Allah alone, and which, at the same time, may go on nourishing and
	developing the state of piety and devotion in one's own self also by
	means of practical experience and discipline. That i why immediately
	after giving the Command for a mental change Allah has given the
	Command for this physical act, i,e. establishment of the Salat. As
	long as an idea is only an idea in the mind of man, it can neither
	be stable nor enduring. It may fade away or even change. But when he
	starts practicing it, the idea takes root in him and goes on
	increasing in stability and strength with more and more practice; so
	much so that when it has become a belief it can neither change nor
	fade away easily. Considered from this viewpoint, no act can be more
	effective than the offering of the Prayer regularly five times a day
	for strengthening piety and fear of God in oneself. The other act,
	whatever it be, is carried out at intervals, or in different forms
	on different occasions, but the Prayer is an act, which is performed
	every few hours in one and the same specific form permanently, in
	which man has to rehearse over and over again the whole lesson
	taught him by the Qur'an about Islam, so that he does not forget it.
	Furthermore, both the believers and the disbelievers have to know
	who among the people has given up the way of rebellion and adopted
	the way of obedience to the Lord. The believers have to know this so
	that they can form into a community and society and can cooperate
	with one another in the way of Allah; then as soon as the
	relationship of any one of them starts showing signs of laxity with
	respect to the Faith and Islam, this should become known to all of
	them at once. The disbelievers have to know this so that the dormant
	nature in them wakens up when they see the people from their own
	kith and kin turning humbly to their real God over and over again,
	and till their nature wakes up they continue to be awe-stricken when
	they see the practical enthusiasm of the obedient servants of God.
	For these two objectives also the establishment of the Prayer is the
	most effective means.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, it

	being severely persecuted by the disbelieving Quraish, and went on
	being persecuted for another nine years after this. At that time
	there was 'no sign of the Islamic government yet in sight. If the
	offering of the Prayer was meaningless without the Islamic
	government, as some ignorant people think, or if the establishment
	of the Salat did not mean the offering of the Prayer at all but the
	establishment of Nizami-Rububiyat (order of Providence), as the
	deniers of Hadith claim, the Qur'anic injunction at that stage would
	have been meaningless. The question is: How did the Holy Prophet and

	individual. morality and formation of character altogether. The
	Qur'anic scheme can operate and function only in a society where the
	individuals own some resources of wealth, possess rights to expend
	it freely, and then render willingly and sincerely the rights of God
	and His servants. In such a society alone there can arise the
	possibility that, on the one hand, the people may develop
	individually the virtues of sympathy, kindliness and affection,
	sacrifice, recognition of the rights of others and rendering those
	rights in the right spirit, and on the other, the beneficiaries may
	develop in their hearts pure feelings of well-wishing, gratitude and
	thankfulness for the donors. This system only can produce the ideal
	conditions in which the elimination of evil and the promotion of
	goodness does not depend on the intervention of a law-enforcing
	authority but the people's own purity of the self and their own good
	intentions take up this responsibility.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote59sym" HREF="#sdfootnote59anc">59</A>This
	is the first verse revealed in the Qur'an that condemned interest.
	It only says this: &quot;You pay interest thinking that it will
	cause an increase in the wealth of the money-lender. But actually,
	in the sight of Allah, interest does not increase the wealth, but
	the wealth is increased by the payment of the Zakat &quot;.
	Afterwards when the Commandment prohibiting interest was sent down
	at Madinah, it was said: &quot;Allah deprives interest of all
	blessing and develops charity.&quot; (For the later Commands, see
	AI-i-`Imran: 130, and AI-Baqarah: 275 to 281). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	verse has been given two interpretations by the commentators. One
	section of them says: Here riba does not mean the interest which is
	forbidden by the Shari'ah, but it means the gift or the present
	which is. given with the intention that the recipient will return it
	redoubled, or will perform some useful service for the donor, or his
	becoming prosperous will be beneficial for the donor himself. &quot;This
	is the view of Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Dahhak, Qatadah, 'Ikrimah,
	Muhammad bin Ka'b al-Qurzi and Sha'bi. Probably this comment has
	been made by these scholars for the reason that in this verse the
	only consequence mentioned of the act is that in the sight of Allah
	such wealth will not increase at all; if, however, it had meant the
	interest forbidden by the Shari'ah, it would have been positively
	said that it will be severely punished by Allah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	group differs from this and says that it means the same well known
	riba' which has been forbidden by the Shari ah. This is the opinion
	of Hasan Basri and Suddi, and 'Allama Alusi also has opined that the
	apparent meaning of the verse is the same, for riba, in Arabic is
	used in the same meaning. This interpretation has been adopted by
	the commentator Nisaburi also. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In our
	opinion also this second interpretation is correct, for the argument
	given in favor of the first interpretation is not enough for
	discarding the well known meaning of the word riba'. In the period
	when Surah Ar-Rum was sent down, interest had not been forbidden
	yet. The prohibition was made several years afterwards. The way of
	the Qur'an is that it first prepares the minds for the thing that it
	has to prohibit at a later stage. About wine also the only thing
	said in the beginning was that it is not pure food. (An-Nahl: 67).
	Then in AI-Baqarah: 219, it was said that the harm of its sin is
	greater than its benefit. Then it was enjoined that the Prayer
	should not be offered in the state of intoxication. (An-Nisa': 43).
	Then, finally, it was prohibited totally. Similarly, about interest
	here it has been only said that it does not increase the wealth, but
	the real increase is caused by the Zakat. After this, the compound
	interest was forbidden (Al-i-`Imran: 130); and finally, interest
	itself was made absolutely unlawful. (AI-Baqarah: 275).&nbsp;
