the commentators have not disputed its being a Makki Surah, yet it is
difficult to determine in which phase of the life at Makkah precisely
it was revealed. However, in view of Abu Lahab's role and conduct
against the Holy Prophet's message of Truth, it can be assumed that
it must have been revealed in the period when he had transgressed all
limits in his mad hostility to him, and his attitude was becoming a
serious obstruction in the progress of Islam. It may well have been
revealed in the period when the Quraish had boycotted the Holy
Prophet (upon whom be peace) together with the people of his clan and
besieged them in Shi'b Abi Talib, and Abu Lahab was the only person
to join with the enemies against his own relatives. The basis of this
assumption is that Abu Lahab was the Holy Prophet's uncle, and public
condemnation of the uncle by the tongue of the nephew could not be
proper until the extreme excesses committed by the uncle had become
visible to everyone. If the Surah had been revealed before this, in
the very beginning, the people would have regarded it as morally
discourteous that the nephew should so condemn the uncle. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

is the only place in the Quran where a person from among the enemies
of Islam has been condemned by name, whereas in Makkah as well as in
Madinah, after the migration, there were many people who were in no
way less inimical to Islam and the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be
Allah's peace and blessings) than Abu Lahab. The question is, what
was the special trait of the character of this person, which became
the basis of this condemnation by name? To understand that it is

esteemed most highly among the moral values of the Arabian society
and breaking off of connections with the kindred was regarded as a
great sin. Under, the influence of the same Arabian tradition when
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) began to preach the message of
Islam, the other clans of Quraish and their chiefs resisted and
opposed him tooth and nail, but the Bani Hashim and the Bani
al-Muttalib (children of al-Muttalib, brother of Hashim) not only did
not oppose him but continued to support him openly, although most of
them had not yet believed in his Prophethood. The other clans of
Quraish themselves regarded this support by the blood relations of
the Holy Prophet as perfectly in accordance with the moral traditions
of Arabia. That is why they never taunted the Bani Hashim and the
Bani al-Muttalib in that they had abandoned their ancestral faith by
supporting a person who was preaching a new faith. They knew and
believed that they could in no case hand over an individual of their
clan to his enemies, and their support and aid of a clansman was
perfectly natural in the sight of the Quraish and the people of
Arabia. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

moral principle, which the Arabs even in the pre-Islamic days of

only by one man in his enmity of Islam, and that was Abu Lahab, son
of Abdul Muttalib. He was an uncle of the Holy Prophet, whose father
and he were sons of the same father. In Arabia, an uncle represented
the father especially when the nephew was fatherless. The uncle was
expected to look after the nephew as one of his own children. But

traditionists have related from Ibn Abbas with several chains of
transmitters the tradition that when the Holy Prophet was commanded
to present the message of Islam openly, and he was instructed in the
Quran to warn first of all his nearest kinsfolk of the punishment of
God, he ascended the Mount, Safa one morning and called out aloud: </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ya

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">(O, the calamity of the morning!).
This alarm in Arabia was raised by the person who noticed early at
dawn an enemy tribe advancing against his tribe. When the Holy
Messenger made this call, the people inquired as to who had made the
call. They were told that it was Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
peace). There the people of all the clans of Quraish rushed out.
Everyone who could, came. He who could not, sent another one for
himself. When the People had assembled, the Holy Messenger calling
out each clan by name, viz. O Bani Hashim, O Bani Abdul Muttalib, O
Bani Fihr, O Bani so and so, said: &quot;If I were to tell you that
behind the hill there was an enemy host ready to fall upon you, would
you believe me?&quot; The people responded with one voice, saying
that they never had so far experienced a lie from him. The Holy
Prophet said: &quot;Then I warn you that you are heading for a
torment.&quot; Thereupon, before anyone else could speak, Abu Lahab,
the Holy Prophet's uncle, said: &quot;May you perish! Did you summon
us for this?&quot;Another tradition adds that he picked up a stone to
throw at the Holy Prophet. (Musnad Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi,
Ibn Jarir, and others). </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>According
to Ibn Zaid, one day Abu Lahab asked the Holy Prophet: &quot;If I
were to accept your religion, what would I get?&quot; The Holy
Prophet replied: &quot;You would get what the other believers would
get.&quot; He said: &quot;Is there no preference or distinction for
me?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;What else do you want?&quot;

other people should be equal and alike!&quot; (Ibn Jarir). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Makkah Abu Lahab was the next door neighbor of the Holy Prophet.
Their houses were separated by a wall. Besides him, Hakam bin As
(Father of Marwan), Uqbah bin Abi Muait, Adi bin Hamra and Ibn
al-Asda il-Hudhali also were his neighbors. These people did not
allow him to have peace even in his own house. Sometimes when he was
performing the Prayer, they would place the goat's stomach on him;
sometimes when food was being cooked in the courtyard, they would
throw filth at the cooking pot. The Holy Prophet would come out and
say: &quot;O Bani Abdi Manaf, what kind of neighborliness is it?&quot;Abu
Lahab's wife, Umm Jamil (Abu Sufyan's sister), had made it a practice
to cast thorns at his door in the night so that when he or his
children came out of the house at dawn, they should run thorns in the
foot. (Baihaqi, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Asakir, Ibn Hisham). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

the proclamation of Prophethood, two of the Holy Prophet's daughters
were married to two of Abu Lahab's sons, Utbah and Utaibah. After his
call when the Holy Prophet began to invite the people to Islam, Abu
Lahab said to both his sons:&quot;I would forbid myself seeing and
meeting you until you divorced the daughters of Muhammad (upon whom
be Allah's peace and blessings).&quot;So, both of them divorced
their, wives. Utaibah in particular became so nasty in his
spitefulness that one day he came before the Holy Prophet and said:

and then he spat at him, but his spital did not fall on him. The Holy
Prophet prayed: &quot;O God, subject him to the power of a dog from
among Your dogs.&quot;Afterwards, Utaibah accompanied his father in
his journey to Syria. During the journey the caravan halted at a
place which, according to local people, was visited by wild beasts at
night. Abu Lahab told his companions, the Quraish: &quot;Make full
arrangements for the protection of my son, for I fear the curse
invoked by Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) on him.&quot;
Accordingly, the people made their camels sit all around Utaibah and
went to sleep. At night a tiger came which crossed the circle of the
camels and devoured Utaibah tearing him to pieces. (Ibn Abdul Barr:

There is also a difference of opinion about whether Abu Lahab's this
son was Utbah or Utaibah. But this much is confirmed that after the
conquest of Makkah, Utbah embraced Islam and took the oath of
allegiance at the Holy Prophet's hand. Therefore, the correct view is
that it was Utaibah). </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Abu
Lahab's wickedness can be judged from the fact that when after the
death of the Holy Prophet's son Hadrat Qasim, his second son, Hadrat
Abdullah, also died, this man instead of joining with his nephew in
his bereavement, hastened to the Quraish chiefs joyfully to give them
the news that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) had
become childless that night. This we have already related in the
commentary of Surah Al-Kauthar. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Wherever
the Holy Prophet went to preach his message of Islam, this man
followed him and forbade the people to listen to him. Rabiah bin
Abbad ad- Dill has related: &quot;I was a young boy when I
accompanied my father to the face of Dhul-Majaz. There I saw the Holy
Messenger (may peace be upon him) who was exhorting the people,
saying: 'O people, say: there is no deity but Allah, you will attain
success.' Following behind him I saw a man, who was telling the
people, `This fellow is a liar: he has gone astray from his ancestral
faith.' I asked; who is he? The people replied: He is his uncle, Abu
Lahab.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Baihaqi). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another
tradition from Hadrat Rabiah is to the effect; &quot;I saw that the
Holy Prophet went to the halting place of each tribe and said: `O
children of so and so, I have been appointed Allah's Messenger to
you. I exhort you to worship only Allah and to associate none with
Him. So, affirm faith in me and join me so that I may fulfill the
mission for which I have been sent.' Following close behind him there
was a man who was saying: `O children of so and so, he is leading you
astray from Lat and Uzza and inviting you to the religion of error
and innovation which he has brought. Do not at all listen to what he
says and do not follow him.' I asked my father: who is he? He
replied: he is his uncle, Abu Lahab.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Tabarani). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

you will attain success', and behind him there was a man who was
casting stones at him, until his heels bled, and he was telling the
people: 'Do not listen to him, he is a liar.' I asked the people who
he was. They said he was his uncle, Abu Lahab.&quot; (Tirmidhi). </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the 7th year of Prophethood, when all the clans of Quraish boycotted
the Bani Hashim and the Bani al-Muttalib socially and economically,
and both these clans remaining steadfast to the Holy Prophet's
support, were besieged in Shib Abi Talib, Abu Lahab was the only
person, who sided with the disbelieving Quraish against his own clan.
This boycott continued for three years, so much so that the Bani
Hashim and the Bani al-Muttalib began to starve. This, however, did
not move Abu Lahab. When a trade caravan came to Makkah and a
besieged person from Shib Abi Talib approached it to buy some article
of food, Abu Lahab would shout out to the merchants to demand a
forbidding price, telling them that he would make up for any loss
that they incurred. Thus, they would demand exorbitant rates and the
poor customer had to return empty handed to his starving children.
Then Abu Lahab would purchase the same articles from them at the
market rates. (Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Hisham). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On
account of these very misdeeds this man was condemned in this Surah
by name, and there was a special need for it. When the Holy Prophet's
own uncle followed and opposed him before the Arabs who came for hajj
from outside Makkah, or gathered together in the fares held at
different places, they regarded it as against the established
traditions of Arabia that an uncle should run down his nephew without
a reason, should pelt stones at him and bring false accusations
against him publicly. They were, therefore, influenced by what Abu
Lahab said and were involved in doubt about the Holy Prophet (upon
whom be peace). But when this, Surah was revealed, and Abu Lahab,
filled with rage, started uttering nonsense, the people realized that
what he said in opposition to the Holy Prophet was not at all
reliable, for he said all that in his mad hostility to his nephew. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Besides,
when his uncle was condemned by name, the people's expectation that
the Holy Messenger (upon whom be peace) could treat some relative
leniently in the matter of religion was frustrated for ever. When the
Holy Messenger's own uncle was taken to task publicly the people
understood that there was no room for preference or partiality in
their faith. A non-relative could become a near and dear one if he
believed, and a near relation a non-relative if he disbelieved. Thus,
there is no place for the ties of blood in religion. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>His
	real name was 'Abd al-'Uzza, and he was called Abu Lahab on account
	of his glowing, ruddy complexion. Lahab means the flame of fire, and
	Abu Lahab the one with a flaming, fiery face. His being mentioned
	here by his nickname (Kunyat), instead of his real name, has several
	reasons. First, that he was better known by his nickname than by his
	real name; second, that the Qur'an did not approve that he should be
	mentioned by his polytheistic name `Abd al 'Uzza (slave of 'Uzza);
	third, that his kunyat goes well with the fate that has been
	described of him in this Surah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	commentators have translated tabbat yada Abi Lahab to mean: &quot;May
	the hands of Abu Lahab be broken&quot;, and tabby to mean: &ldquo;may
	he perish&quot; or &quot;he perished&quot;. But this, in fact, was
	not a curse which was invoked on him, but a prophecy in which an
	event taking place in the future, has been described in the past
	tense, to suggest that its occurrence in the future is certain and
	inevitable. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In actual
	fact, at last the same thing happened as had been foretold in this
	Surah a few years earlier. Breaking of the hands obviously does not
	imply breaking of the physical hands, but a person's utterly failing
	in his aim and object for which he has exerted his utmost. And Abu
	Lahab indeed had exerted his utmost to defeat and frustrate the
	message of Islam presented by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace).
	But hardly seven or eight years after the revelation of this Surah
	most of the big chiefs of Quraish, who were a party with Abu Lahab
	in his hostility to Islam, were killed in the Battle of Badr. When
	the news of the defeat reached Makkah, he was so shocked that he
	could not survive for more than seven days. His death occurred in a
	pitiable state. He became afflicted with malignant pustule and the
	people of his house left him to himself, fearing contagion. No one
	came near his body for three days after his death, until the body
	decomposed and began to stink. At last, when the people began to
	taunt his sons, according to one tradition, they hired some
	Africans, who lifted his body and buried it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to another tradition, they got a pit dug out and threw his body into
	it by pushing it with wood, and covered it up with earth and stones.
	His utter failure became manifest when the religion which he had
	tried his utmost to impede and thwart, was accepted by his own
	children. First of all, his daughter, Darrah, migrated from Makkah
	to Madinah and embraced Islam; then on the conquest of Makkah, both
	his sons, `Utabh and Mu`attab, came before the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be peace) through the mediation of Hadrat `Abbas, believed and
	took oath of allegiance to him.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>Abu
	Lahab was a stingy, materialistic man. Ibn Jarir has stated that
	once in the pre-Islamic days he was accused of having stolen two
	golden deer from the treasury of the Ka'bah. Though later the deer
	were recovered from another person, the fact that he was accused of
	stealing indicates the opinion the people of Makkah held of him.
	About his riches Qadi Rashid bin Zubair writes in his Adh-Dhakha'ir
	wat-Tuhaf. He was one of the four richest men of the Quraish, who
	owned one qintar (about 260 oz) of gold each. His love of wealth can
	be judged from the fact that when on the occasion of the battle of
	Badr the fate of his religion was going to be decided for ever, and
	all the Quraish chiefs had personally gone to fight, he sent `As bin
	Hisham to fight on his own behalf, telling him: This is in lieu of
	the debt of four thousand dirhams that you owe to me. Thus. he
	contrived a plan to realize his debt, for 'As had become bankrupt
	and there was no hope of the recovery of the debt from him. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	commentators have taken ma kasaba in the meaning of the earning,
	i.r. the benefits that accrued to him from his wealth were his
	kasab(earning), and some other commentators have taken it to imply
	children, for the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has said that a
	man's son also is his kasab (earning). (Abu Da'ud, Ibn Abi Hatim).
	Both these meanings fully correspond to the fate met by Abu Lahab.
	For when he was afflicted with the malignant pustule, his wealth
	availed him nothing, and his children also left him alone to die a
	miserable, wretched death. They did not even bury him honorably.
	Thus, within a few years the people witnessed how the prophecy which
	had been made in this Surah about Abu Lahab was literally
	fulfilled.&nbsp;

	name was Arwa' and her nickname (kunyat) Umm Jamil. She was sister
	of Abu Sufyan and was no less bitter than her husband, Abu Lahab, in
	her enmity to the Holy Messenger (upon whom be peace) Hadrat Abu
	Bakr's daughter, Hadrat Asma', has related that when this Surah was
	revealed, and Umm Jamil heard it, she was filled with rage and went
	out in search of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). She carried
	a handful of stones and she was crying some verses of her own,
	satirizing the Holy Prophet. She came to the Ka`bah, where the Holy
	Prophet was sitting with Hadrat Abu Bakr. The latter said: &quot;O
	Messenger of Allah, there she comes and I fear lest she should utter
	something derogatory to you.&quot; The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;She
	will not see me.&quot; The same thing happened. She could not see
	the Holy Prophet although he was there. She said to Hadrat Abu Bakr:
	&quot;I hear that your Companion has satirized me.&quot; Hadrat Abu
	Bakr replied: &quot;No, by the Lord of this house, he has not
	satirized you.&quot; Hearing this she went off. (lbn Abi Hatim, Ibn
	Hisham; Bazzar has related an incident on the authority of Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin `Abbas also, which closely resembles this). What
	Hadrat Abu Bakr meant was that she had not been satirized by the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace), but by Allah Himself.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>The
	words in the original are hammalat al-hatab, which literally mean:
	&quot;carrier of the wood&quot;. The commentators have given several
	meanings of it. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Ibn Zaid, Dahhak and
	Rabi` bin Anas say: She used to strew thorns at the Holy Prophet's
	door in the night; therefore, she has been described as carrier of
	the wood. Qatadah, Ikrimah Hasan Bari, Mujahid and Sufyan Thauri
	say: She used to carry evil tales and slander from one person to
	another in order to create hatred between them; therefore, she has
	been called the bearer of wood idiomatically. Sa`id bin Jubair says:
	The one who is loading himself with the burden of sin, is described
	idiomatically in Arabic as: Fulan-un Yahtatibu ala zahri bi (so and
	so is loading wood on his back); therefore, hummalat al-hatab means:
	&ldquo;The one who carries the burden of sin.&rdquo; Another meaning
	also which the commentators have given is: she will do this in the
	Hereafter, i.e. she will bring and supply wood to the fire in which
	Abu Lahab would be burning.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>The
	word used for her neck is jid, which in Arabic means a neck
	decorated with an ornament. Sa`id bin al-Musayyab, Hasan Basri and
	Qatadah say that she wore a valuable necklace and used to say: &quot;By
	Lat and `Uzza, I will sell away this necklace and expend the price
	to satisfy my enmity against Muhammad (Allah's peace and blessings
	be upon him).&quot; That is why the word jid has been used here
	ironically, thereby implying that in Hell she would have a rope of
	palm-fibre round her neck instead of that necklace upon which she
	prides herself so arrogantly. Another example of this ironical style
	is found at several places in the Qur'an in the sentence:
	Bashshir-hum bi-`adhab-in alima &quot;Give them the good news of a
	painful torment.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The words
	babl-um min-masad have been used for the rope which will be put
	round her neck, i e. it will be a rope of the masad kind. Different
	meanings of this have been given by the lexicographers and
	commentators. According to some, masad means a tightly twisted rope;
	others say that: masad is the rope made from palm-fibre; still
	others say that it means the rope made from rush, or camel-skin, or
	camel-hair. Still another view is that it implies a cable made by
	twisted iron strands together.&nbsp;
