<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>According
to a well known and authentic tradition when Hadrat Umar set out to
kill the Holy Prophet, he met a certain person, who said, &quot;Before
you do anything else, you should know that your own sister and
brother-in-law have embraced Islam&quot; Hearing this, he directly
went to the house of his sister. There he found his sister, Fatimah,
and his brother-in-law, Said bin Zaid, learning the contents of a
scroll from Khabbab bin Art. When Fatimah saw him coming she hid the
scroll at once, but Hadrat Umar had heard the recital, so he began to
interrogate them about it. Then he began to thrash his
brother-in-law, and wounded his sister, who tried to protect him. At
last both of them confessed, &quot;We have become Muslims; you may do
whatever you like.&quot; As Hadrat Umar was moved to see blood
running down from her head, he said, &quot;Show me the thing you were
reading.&quot; The sister asked him to promise on oath that he would
not tear it, and added, &quot;You cannot touch it unless you have a
bath.&quot; Accordingly, Hadrat Umar took his bath and when he began
to read the scroll, which contained this Surah, he spontaneously
spoke out, &quot;What an excellent thing!&quot; At this Hadrat
Khabbab, who had hidden himself at the sound of his footsteps, came
out of his hiding and said, &quot;By God, I have high expectations
that Allah will get great service from you to propagate the Message
of His Prophet, for just yesterday I heard the Holy Prophet praying
to Allah, 'My Lord, make Abul Hakam bin Hisham (Abu Jahl) or Umar bin
Khattab a supporter of Islam. So O Umar, turn to Allah, turn to
Allah.&quot; These words proved to be so persuasive that he at once
accompanied Hadrat Khabbab and went to the Holy Prophet to embrace
Islam. This happened a short time after the Migration to Habash. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
Surah begins with the enunciation of the object of the Revelation of
the Qur'an to this effect:&quot;O Muhammad, this Quran has not been
sent down to you to put you unnecessarily to some great affliction.
It does not demand from you to perform the impossible task of imbuing
the hearts of the obdurate disbelievers with Faith. It is merely an
admonition meant to guide on to the Right Path those who fear God and
want to save themselves from His punishment. This Quran is the Word
of the Master of the earth and the heavens and God-head belongs to
Him alone:These two facts are eternal whether one believes them or
not.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

this introduction, the Surah abruptly moves on to relate the story of
Prophet Moses without any apparent relevancy and without even hinting
at its applicability to the events of the period. However, if we read
between the lines, we realize that the discourse is addressed very
relevantly to the people of Makkah. But before we explain the hidden
meaning of the discourse, we must keep in view the fact that the
Arabs in general acknowledged Moses as a Prophet of God. This was so
because they had &quot;been influenced by the large number of the
Jews around them and by&quot; the neighboring Christian kingdoms. Now
let us state those things which are hidden between the lines of the
story: </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	victorious over Pharaoh, who possessed large armies and war

	comforted, though not in so many words, that they should not be
	afraid of fighting with the Quraish against fearful odds, for the

Recall the time when We inspired your mother with this idea by means

river; the river will cast it on to the bank and My enemy and his
enemy will pick it up. I Myself made you an object of love and so
arranged things that you should be brought up under My supervision.
Recall the time when your sister was walking along; then she said:
`May I inform you of one, who will bring up this child in the best
manner?' Thus We returned you to your mother so that her .eye might
be cooled and she might not be grieved. And (also remember that) you
killed a certain person and We freed you from its evil (consequences)
and put you through various trials and you stayed with the people of
Midian for several years. Now you have come back at the right time: O
Moses, I have molded you for My Mission. You and your brother should
go (on the Mission) with My Signs. And see that you do not show any
negligence in remembering Me.&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	Moses prayed to Allah for this because he was conscious that he was

	Messenger he would have to be fluent in order to impress Pharaoh and
	his courtiers. This is confirmed by the Bible (Exodus 4: 10) but the
	Talmud gives a strange explanation for this impediment in his
	speech. According to it, when he was a child he burnt his tongue
	with a live coal to escape punishment from Pharaoh whose crown he
	had taken off from his head and put it on his own head. The same
	story has been adopted by many of our commentators though it is
	absurd on the face of it. Our interpretation is also confirmed by
	the Qur'an. The tact is, that at first he was not a fluent speaker
	and Pharaoh had also taunted him on this impediment (XLIII: 52).
	Prophet Moses realized the same for he said, &quot;My brother Aaron
	is more fluent than I, so send him with me as a helper, so that he
	may support me (with his fluent speech).&quot; (XXVIII: 34).
	Afterwards this impediment in his speech was removed and he was able

	when God said to Moses that He would send him to Pharaoh, Moses
	replied, &quot;Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I
	should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?&quot;
	(Exodus 3: 11). God persuaded and encouraged Moses by giving him
	Signs but he was still reluctant and said, &quot;O my Lord, send, I
	pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.&quot; (Exodus 4:
	13). And the Talmud goes even further than this and says that there
	was an argument between God and Moses for seven days that he should
	become a Prophet but Moses did not accept the offer. At this God was
	angry with him and so made his brother Aaron a partner in his
	Prophethood. Moreover, He deprived the descendants of Moses of the
	office of priesthood and bestowed it on the descendants of Aaron.

	On seeing these miracles Pharaoh was so upset that he cried out,
	&quot;Have you come to drive us out of .our country by the power of
	your sorcery? although he knew that it had never happened in history
	that a magician had conquered a country by the power of sorcery.
	Moreover, there were hundreds of magicians in his own country, who
	used to show their feats to earn rewards and prizes. Accordingly,
	Pharaoh's statement that &quot;you are a sorcerer&quot; on the one
	hand, and his apprehension that &quot;you want to snatch my kingdom&quot;
	on the other, were a clear indication of his perturbed mind: In

	of Moses and his miracles were bound to influence not only his
	courtiers, but also the common people and accordingly he tried to
	play upon their prejudices through falsehood and treachery. He did
	not admit that it was a miracle, but called it sorcery. He wanted to
	create an impression that any sorcerer of his empire could turn a
	staff into a serpent. He also incited the people, saying: &quot;Look!
	he says that your forefathers were on the wrong way and deserved
	perdition. So beware of him! He is not a Prophet. He simply aspires
	for power. He wants that the Israelites should again capture power

	People were especially encouraged to come in the largest numbers to

	practice of religion as well as in the ideologies. (Toynbee: A Study

	Monotheism to a creed of polytheism. Besides this, there was also a
	fairly large element of the worshipers of One God for the Israelites
	and their fellow believers were at least ten per cent of the total

	religious revolution had been brought about by Pharaoh Amenophis IV
	or Akhenaton (1377-1360 B.C.) by military force, which had abolished
	all deities except Aton, a single, universal god, which was
	worshiped by the king and his family. Though this religious

	to believe in God while he was drowning but this was rejected by God
	and he was told that his dead body would he preserved for the coming
	generations to serve as a lesson for them.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote56sym" HREF="#sdfootnote56anc">55</A>This
	was a subtle warning to the disbelievers of Makkah, as if to say,
	&quot;Your chiefs and leaders are leading you on the same way on
	which Pharaoh led his people; now you may yourselves see that he did
	not guide them aright.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In
	conclusion, it will be worth while to consider the version as given
	in the Bible, for this will make it plain that it is absolutely
	false and ridiculous to say that the Qur'an has copied these stories
	from the Israelite traditions. We learn from Exodus the following:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	According to 4: 2-5, the miracle of the staff was given to Prophet
	Moses, and in 4:17 he was instructed: &quot;And thou shalt take this
	rod in throe hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs&quot;, but
	according to 7: 9, the same rod was transferred to Prophet Aaron and
	then it remained with him to work miracles.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	first dialogue between Prophet Moses and Pharaoh has been given in
	Chapter 5, but there is no mention in it whatever of the Doctrine of
	Tauhid presented by Moses. In answer to Pharaoh's question: &quot;Who
	is the Lord that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know
	not the Lord&quot;, Moses and Aaron merely said, &quot;The God of
	the Hebrews hath met with us&quot;. (5: 2-3).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	encounter with the magicians has been summed up in a few sentences
	thus: &quot;And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,
	When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you:
	then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before
	Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. And Moses and Aaron went in
	unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the Lord had commanded: and Aaron
	cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it
	became a serpent. Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the
	sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner
	with their enchantments. For they cast down every man his rod, and
	they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.&quot;
	(7' 8-12)</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When we
	compare this with the version of it in the Qur'an, it becomes
	obvious that the description in the Bible lacks the real essence of
	the whole encounter, for it does not mention that the encounter took
	place on the Day of the Feast in the open as a result of a regular
	challenge, and there is no mention at all that the magicians became
	believers in the Lord of Moses and Aaron and remained steadfast in
	their faith even in face of terrible threats.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4)
	According to the Qur'an, Prophet Moses demanded full freedom and
	liberty for the Israelites, but according to the Bible his demand
	was only this: &quot;Let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey
	into the desert, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God. &quot; (5:3)</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) In
	Chapters 11 to 14, the details of the events concerning the exodus
	from Egypt to the drowning of Pharaoh have been given. Though these
	contain some useful information and details about the events which
	have been briefly described in the Qur'an, they contain some strange
	contradictions as well. For instance, in 14:15-16 the staff (rod)
	again comes into the hands of Prophet Moses, who is commanded: &quot;....
	lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out throe hand over the sea, and
	divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through
	the midst of the sea.&quot; But in w. 21 -22, it is said: &quot;And
	Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the Lord caused the
	sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea
	dry /and, and the waters were divided. And the children of Israel
	went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground.' and the waters
	were a wall unto them, on their right hand, and on their left. &quot;
	It is not clear whether the sea was divided by a miracle or by a
	strong &quot;east wind&quot; which incidentally has never been known
	to divide the sea into two parts leaving a dry path between them.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It will
	also be worth while to make a study of these events as given in the
	Talmud. The Talmudic account differs from the Biblical version but
	is nearer to the one given in the Qur'an. A comparative study of the
	two clearly shows that the one is based on direct Revelation from
	Allah and the other on centuries old oral traditions which have been
	handed down from one generation to the other and thus considerably
	tampered with. (See H. Polano: The Talmud Selections, pp. 150-154).

	is obvious from the last letter `ya' that Samiri was not the proper

	further explanation than this, but this has been necessitated
	because many Christian missionaries and the Western Orientalists
	have tried to criticise the Holy Prophet and the Qur'an on this
	account. They say, (God forbid,) &quot;This is a proof of the
	grievous ignorance of history on the part of Muhammad, the author of
	the Qur'an, and is one of the anachronisms of the Qur'an.&quot; They
	base this absurd criticism on the assumption that this Samiri was
	the inhabitant of Samaria, the capital of the ancient kingdom of
	Israel, which was built in 925 B.C. long after this happening; then
	centuries after this, a generation of the Samaritans came into

	of mere hearsay. They say that the Holy Prophet might have heard
	something like this from the neighboring Jews and inserted it in the
	Qur'an. This is not all. They also criticize that Haman who was a
	courtier of Cyrus has been mentioned in the Qur'an as a minister of
	Pharaoh. It is a pity that these so-called scholars seem to think
	that in the ancient times there used to be only one person bearing

	was brought before us, we involuntarily got involved in shirk. &quot;
	The Arabic text which we have translated into: &quot;We felt

	&quot;The heavy ornaments which our men and women were wearing like
	the Egyptians proved very burdensome to us in our wanderings in the

	very difficult for us to travel in the desert with them.&quot; But

	intention, &quot;....and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon
	your daughters and ye shall spoil the Egyptians....and let every man

	they had borrowed from their Egyptian neighbors, with the intention
	of carrying them away as a &quot;spoil&quot; bestowed by God.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">We are of
	the opinion that the clause of the verse under discussion means
	this: &quot;When the people were tired of carrying their ornaments
	on their bodies, they decided by mutual consultation that all the
	ornaments should be gathered at one place and it should be noted
	down how much gold and silver belonged to each of the owners. Then

	ornaments and throwing them down into the heap while they were
	absolutely unaware of what was going to be done by the Samiri. After
	this the Samiri offered his services to melt it. Then he shaped it

	the Qur'an exonerates Prophet Aaron from the sin of taking any pan
	in the calf-worship, but in contrast to this, the Bible makes him
	wholly responsible for making the golden calf and setting it up as a
	god. According to Exodus:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;And
	when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the

	golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons,
	and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. And all the people
	broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought

	with a graying tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they
	said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the
	land of Egypt. And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar. before it;
	and Aaron made proclamation, and said, Tomorrow is a feast to the
	Lord.&quot; 1,32: 1-5).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is
	just possible that the real name of the Samiri was also Aaron which
	later on might have misled the Israelites to attribute the making of
	the golden calf to Prophet Aaron. Thus it is obvious that the Qur'an
	has shown a favor to the Jews and Christians by exonerating Prophet
	Aaron from the sin, but it is an irony that the Christian
	missionaries and the Orientalists still insist that the Qur'an is
	guilty of anachronism and that the calf was made a deity of worship
	by a holy prophet of ,theirs. In their blind obduracy they forget
	that even according to the Bible this was a great sin. (Exodus, 32:
	21). A little further on in the same chapter the Bible again
	contradicts itself. It says that Prophet Moses ordered the Levites
	to kill all their kinsfolk, their friends and their fellow country
	men who had been guilty of the sin of calf-worship. Accordingly,
	about three thousand men fell that day. (Exodus, 32: 27-29). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now the
	question arises: Why was Prophet Aaron not killed, if he was the
	inventor of the calf-worship? Why didn't the Levites ask Prophet
	Moses to kill his brother, Prophet Aaron, who was the real sinner,
	just as they were asked to kill theirs. The Bible also says that
	after this Moses went back to the Eternal and prayed Him to forgive
	their sins or blot him out of His list of the living, and the
	Eternal answered: &quot;Whosoever has sinned against me, him will I
	blot out of my book&quot; (Exodus, 32: 31-33). But we learn from the
	Bible that the name of Prophet Aaron was not blotted out, but, on
	the other hand, he and his sons and his family were given the charge
	of the sanctuary and the office of priesthood (Numbers, 18: 1-7).
	Thus it is quite evident from the internal testimony of the Bible
	itself, that it contradicts itself and supports the Qur'an in its
	exoneration of Prophet Aaron.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If we
	study the verse in the context in which it occurs, we shall be able
	to understand easily that the Samiri was a mischief-monger who had
	contrived his deceitful scheme after a good deal of consideration.
	As he appears to have been a good craftsman, he caused the golden
	calf he had made to produce a lowing sound, and successfully deluded
	the ignorant and simple people. He did not rest content with this
	but impudently invented the story that he had seen what the common
	people could not see and that he had taken a handful of the dust
	from the footprints of the Messenger and sprinkled it on the calf
	which made it low like a living calf. It is possible that by the
	&quot;Messenger&quot;, he meant Prophet Moses himself and might have
	cunningly tried to flatter him, saying, that the dust of his
	footprints was miraculous. By saying so, he was playing the most
	subtle trick. He wanted to offer an intellectual bait to Moses so
	that he might feel elated about the miraculous effect of the dust
	trodden by his feet and utilize his services for propagating his own
	miraculous acts. Anyhow, the fact is that the Qur'an has presented
	the whole thing as a trick of the Samiri and has not given the
	account as if it were a real event by itself. The subsequent
	reaction of Prophet Moses to the statement of the Samiri clearly
	shows that he considered it as a deceitful story, and so laid the
	curse on him.

	is worth while to understand the nature of human weakness which
	helped Satan to seduce Adam and Eve. They succumbed to seduction
	because Satan tempted them in the garb of a true friend and
	well-wisher even though they knew full well that he was their enemy.
	For Adam had a direct knowledge of the envy and enmity of Satan, who
	had challenged to seduce and ruin him in his very presence. Allah
	had also warned them to guard against the envy of and the
	temptations by Satan and had informed them of the consequences of
	disobedience. Above all, Adam and Eve still believed in Allah and
	never thought of intentional disobedience. But in spite of this,
	when Satan tempted them in the garb of a friend, they disobeyed
	their Lord: they forgot the &quot;Command&quot; for the time being
	for lack of fineness of purpose. And since then this human weakness
	has persisted in their descendants during all ages.</P>

	In contrast to Adam and Eve, Satan was cursed because he not only

	challenged Him that it was He Who was responsible for his

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote107sym" HREF="#sdfootnote107anc">106</A>Here
	the story of Prophet Adam ends. In the light of this part of the
	story which has been related here and at other places in the Qur'an,
	I have come to the conclusion (and correct knowledge is with Allah
	alone) that the &quot;vicegerency of the Earth&quot; was the same as
	was initially bestowed on Adam in the Garden, which might have been
	created in the heavens or on this Earth. Anyhow the vicegerent of
	Allah was supplied gratis with all the necessities of life and the
	angels were placed under his command for service. This was to enable
	him to discharge the high and noble obligations of vicegerency,
	without any worry about the procurement of the necessities of life.
	But in order to make hire permanent in this office, it was necessary
	to put him to a test so that all his capabilities, excellences and
	weaknesses might be known. Accordingly, he had to take his test in
	which some of his weaknesses came to the surface: he was prone to be
	seduced by greed and temptation: he did not remain firm in
	obedience: he was capable of forgetfulness. That is why he was given
	the &quot;vicegerency&quot; as a trial in the Earth for a fixed term
	up to the Day of Judgment. During this period of trial, he had
	himself to make arrangements for the necessities of life though he
	was allowed to exploit all the resources of the Earth and to rule
	over other creatures. The trial is this: does he or does he not obey
	his Lord in spite of having the power to obey or not to obey? And if
	he forgets or is seduced by greed, does he or does he not repent
	through warning and admonition, when he realizes his error? At the
	same time, his Lord has warned him that a full and perfect record of
	all his deeds and misdeeds is being kept, and that he shall be
	judged on the Day of Reckoning in accordance with it. Those who will
	come out successful will be given permanent vicegerency and that
	eternal life and everlasting kingdom by which Satan seduced . him.
	The righteous servants will become the heirs to the Garden, if they
	had obeyed their Lord or repented after &quot;forgetfulness&quot;.
	It should also be noted well that life in the Garden will not merely
	be to &quot;eat, drink and be merry&quot;, but there will be such
	higher things to achieve as no human being can conceive in this
	world. That is why only those blessings of the Garden have been
	mentioned in the Qur'an which can be comprehended by human beings in
	this world.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It will
	be worth while to make a comparative study of the account of Adam
	and Eve as given in the Qur'an with that given in the Bible.
	According to Genesis:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;And
	the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into
	his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. And
	the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the
	man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to
	grow every tree....the tree of life....and the tree of knowledge of
	good and evil....And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of
	every tree of the garden thou mayst freely eat: But of the tree of
	the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the
	day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die .... And the rib,
	which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought
	her unto the man.... And they were both naked, the man and his wife,
	and were not ashamed.&quot; (2:725). &quot;Now the serpent was more
	subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And
	he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of
	every tree of the garden?.... And the serpent said unto the woman,
	Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat
	thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods,
	knowing good and evil....she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat,
	and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. And the
	eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked;
	and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. And
	they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the
	cool of the day: and Adam and wife hid themselves from the presence
	of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God
	called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I
	heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was
	naked; and I hid myself. And He said, who told thee that thou west
	naked? Hast thou eaten, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest
	not eat? And the man said, The woman whom thou gayest to be with me,
	she gave me of the tree, and I did eat...........And the woman said,
	the serpent beguiled me, and I did eat. And the Lord God said unto
	the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all
	cattle, and above every blast of the field; upon thy belly shalt
	thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life: And I
	will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and
	her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
	Unto the woman he said, 1 will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
	conception; in sorrow thou shah bring forth children; and thy desire
	shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. And unto Adam
	he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and
	hast eaten of the tree, of which 1 commanded thee, saying, Thou
	shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow
	shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life:.... In the sweat of
	thy face shalt thou eat bread. Unto Adam also and to his wife did
	the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them. And the Lord God
	said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil:
	and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of
	life, and eat, and live for ever: Therefore the Lord God sent him
	forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was
	taken.&quot; (3 :1-23).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is
	obvious that the Bible has not done justice to Adam and Eve, nay,
	even to God Himself. On the other hand, the account given in the
	Qur'an is itself a clear proof that the stories given in it have not
	been copied from the Bible; for the Qur'an not only corroborates
	those parts of the Bible which have remained untampered but also
	corrects its wrong statements.

	Qur'an has described the different conditions and experiences
	through which the criminals will pass from the Day of Resurrection
	to the time of their entry into Hell: &quot;You were neglectful of
	this; now We have removed the curtain from before you and your sight
	has become very sharp.&quot; (L: 22). &quot;He is only deferring
	them to the Day when all eyes shall stare with consternation. They
	will be running in terror with heads uplifted and eyes fixed upwards
