<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
too is one of the earliest surahs to be revealed at Makkah, but its

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
consists of three themes: Replies to the opponents objections,
administration of warning and admonition to them, and exhortation to
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) to patience and constancy. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At
the outset, the Holy Prophet has been addressed, to the effect: &quot;The
disbelievers call you a madman whereas the Book that you are
presenting and the sublime conduct that you practice, are by
themselves sufficient to refute their false accusations. Soon they
will see as to who was mad and who was sane; therefore, do not at all
yield to the din of opposition being kicked up against you, for all
this is actually meant to cow you and make you resort to a compromise
with them.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
in order to enlighten the common people the character of a prominent
man from among the opponents, whom the people of Makkah fully well
recognized, has been presented, without naming him:At that time, the
Holy Prophet's pure and sublime conduct was before them, and every
discerning eye could also see what sort of character and morals were
possessed by the chiefs of Makkah, who were leading the opposition
against him.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
in vv. 17-33, the parable of the owners of a garden has been
presented, who after having been blessed by Allah turned ungrateful
to Him, and did not heed the admonition of the best man among them
when it was given them. Consequently, they were deprived of the
blessing and they realized this, when all they had lay devastated.
With this parable the people of Makkah have been warned to the
effect:&quot;With the appointment of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) to Prophethood, you, O people of Makkah, too, have been put to
a test similar to the one to which the owners of the garden had been
put. If you do not listen to him, you too will be afflicted with a
punishment in the world, and the punishment of the Hereafter is far
greater.&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
in vv. 34-47 continuously, the disbelievers have been admonished, in
which the address sometimes turns to them directly and sometimes they
are warned through the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). A summary
of what has been said in this regard, is this: Well being in the
Hereafter inevitably belongs to those who spend their lives in the
world in full consciousness of God. It is utterly against reason that
the obedient servants should meet in the Hereafter the same fate as
the guilty. There is absolutely no basis of the disbelievers
misunderstanding that God will treat them in the manner they choose
for themselves, whereas they have no guarantee for this. Those who
are being called upon to bow before God in the world and they refuse
to do so, would be unable to prostrate themselves on the Day of
Resurrection even if they wanted to do so, and thus would stand
disgraced and condemned. Having denied the Qur'an they cannot escape
Divine punishment. The rein they are being given, has deluded them.
They think that since they are not being punished in spite of their
denial, they must be on the right path, whereas they are following
the path of ruin. They have no reasonable ground for opposing the
Messenger, for he is a preacher without any vested interest: he is
not asking any reward of them for himself, and they cannot either
make the claim that they know with certainty that he is not a true
Messenger, nor that what he says is false. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been exhorted
to the effect:&quot;Bear with patience the hardships that you may
have to face in the way of preaching the Faith till Allah's judgment
arrives, and avoid the impatience which caused suffering and
affliction to the Prophet Jonah (peace be on him).&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

We have tried them (the people of Makkah) just as we had tried the
owners of a certain garden,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote12anc" HREF="#sdfootnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
when they swore that they would surely pluck the fruit of their
garden next morning, and they did not make any exception.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote13anc" HREF="#sdfootnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A>
But while they lay asleep at night, a calamity from your Lord visited
the garden and it became as though it had already been reaped. In the
morning they called out to one another, saying: &quot;Go forth early
to your tilth<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote14anc" HREF="#sdfootnote14sym"><SUP>14</SUP></A>
if you would pluck fruit.&quot; So they set out, whispering to one
another, &quot;Let no needy man approach you in the garden today.&quot;
They hurried off early (to their garden) with the resolve not to give
away anything<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote15anc" HREF="#sdfootnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
as though they had the power (to pluck the fruit). But when they saw
the garden, they said, &quot;We have lost our way!-Nay, but we have
been left destitute!&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote16anc" HREF="#sdfootnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A>

Then they began to blame one another.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote18anc" HREF="#sdfootnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
At last, they said, &quot;Alas for us! Indeed we had become
rebellious. It may well be that our Lord will give us in exchange a
better garden than this. We turn to our Lord.&quot; Such is the
torment, and the torment of the Hereafter is far greater. Would that

	the disbelievers who say that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	is, God forbid, a madman, Before his claim to the Prophethood, the

	This meant that the Qur'an itself in their sight was the cause

	removing which he might have stood in need of such an assurance. The

	because of which you-are calling the one presenting it a madman, is

	proof that the accusation of madness that the disbelievers bring
	against you is absolutely false, for high morals and madness cannot
	co-exist in one and the same person. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A madman
	is he whose balance of mind is upset, who has lost his temperamental
	equilibrium. Contrary to this, the high morals of a person testify
	that he is a right-minded and sound-natured person, who possesses
	perfect temperamental equilibrium. The people of Makkah were not
	unaware of the morals and character possessed by the Holy Messenger
	of Allah. Therefore, it was enough just to make a reference to them
	so that every reasonable man of Makkah was made to think how
	shameless were those people who were calling a man of such sublime
	morals and character a madman. Their absurd conduct was not at all
	harmful for the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) but for
	themselves, for maddened in their craze for opposition they were
	saying such a thing about him which could not be regarded as
	credible by any man of understanding. The same also is the case with
	those men of knowledge and scholarship, who in the modern time are
	accusing the Holy prophet (upon whom be peace) of having fits of
	madness and epilepsy. The Qur'an is available everywhere in the
	world and the Holy Prophet's life also exists in the written form in
	entire detail. Every person can see it for himself what a foolish
	and meaningless thing is being uttered in their blind enmity by
	those who regard the man who brought this unique and matchless Book
	and who possessed such sublime morals and character as a mentally
	deranged person.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The best
	description of the Holy Prophet's character has been given by Hadrat
	'A'ishah in her statement: Kana khuluqu-hul-Qur an: the Qur'an was
	his character.&quot; Imam Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Da'ud. Nasa'i, Ibn
	Majah, Darimi and Ibn Jarir have cited, with a little variation in
	wording, this saying with several chains of transmitters. This means
	that the Holy Prophet had not merely presented the teaching of the
	Qur'an before the world but also given its practical demonstration
	by his personal example. Whatever was enjoined in the Qur'an was
	acted upon practically by himself in the first instance; whatever
	was forbidden in it was shunned and avoided by himself most of all.
	His own self was characterized most of all by the moral qualities
	which were declared as sublime by it, and his own self was most free
	from those qualities which were declared as abhorrent and
	reprehensible by it. In another tradition Hadrat 'A'ishah has
	stated: &quot;The Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) never hit a
	servant, never raised his hand on a woman never used his hand to
	kill a person outside the battlefield, never avenged himself on
	anyone for an injury caused unless someone violated a sanctity
	enjoined by Allah and he avenged it for the sake of Allah. His
	practice was that whenever he had to choose between two things, he
	would choose the easier one unless it was a sin; and if it was a sin
	he would keep away from it most of all&quot; (Musnad Ahmad). Hadrat
	Anas says: &quot;I served the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) for
	ten years. He never did so much as express even a slight disgust
	over what I did or said: he never asked why I had done what I had
	done, and never inquired why I had not done what I had not done.&quot;
	(Bukhari, Muslim).&nbsp;

	who was disinclined to do so. For this purpose the people will be
	called upon to prostrate themselves before Allah. Then, those who
	had been sincerely worshiping Allah in the world, would prostrate
	themselves, and those who had declined to bow before Him in the
	world, would be unable to do so. It will become impossible for them
	to put up a false show of being worshipers. Therefore, they will
	remain standing, degraded and downcast with shame.</P>
