Hasan Basri, 'Ikrimah, 'Ata' and Jabir bin Zaid say that these Surahs
are Makki. A tradition from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also supports
the same view. However, according to another tradition from him, it
is Madani and the same view is held also by Hadrat 'Abdullah bin

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">is used as an argument for these
Surahs to be Madani because Hadrat 'Uqbah bin 'Amir had become a
Muslim in Madinah after the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">hijrah</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
as related by Abu Da'ud and Nasa'i on the basis of his own statement.
Other traditions which have lent strength to this view are those
related by Ibn Sa'd, Muhiyy-us-Sunnah Baghawi, Imam Nasafi, Imam
Baihaqi, Hafiz Ibn Hajar, Hafiz Badr-uddin 'Ayni, 'Abd bin Humaid and
others to the effect that these Surahs were revealed when the Jews
had worked magic on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) in Madinah
and he had fallen ill under its effect. Ibn Sa'd has related on the
authority of Waqidi that this happened in A.H. 7. On this very basis
Sufyan bin Uyainah also has described these Surah as Madani. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">But
as we have explained in the Introduction to Surah Al-Ikhlas, when it
is said about a certain Surah or verse that it was revealed on this
or that particular occasion, it does not necessarily mean that it was
revealed for the first time on that very occasion. Rather it
sometimes so happened that a Surah or a verse had previously been
revealed, then on the occurrence or appearance of a particular
incident or situation, the Holy Prophet's attention was drawn to it
by Allah for the second time, or even again and again. In our opinion
the same also was the case with the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mu'awwidhatayn</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
The subject matter of these Surahs is explicit that these were sent
down at Makkah in the first instance when opposition to the Holy
Prophet there had grown very intense. Later, when at Madinah storms
of opposition were raised by the hypocrites, Jews and polytheists,
the Holy Prophet was instructed to recite these very Surahs, as has
been mentioned in the above cited tradition from Hadrat Uqbah bin
Amir. After this, when magic was worked on him, and his illness grew
intense, Gabriel came and instructed him by Allah's command to recite
these very Surahs. Therefore, in our opinion, the view held by the
commentators who describe both these Surahs as Makki is more
reliable. Regarding them as connected exclusively with the incident
of magic is difficult, for to this incident related only one verse
(v.4), the remaining verses of Surah al Falaq and the whole of Surah
An-Nas have nothing to do with it directly. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<H2 STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Theme
and Subject-Matter</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
conditions under which these two Surahs were sent down in Makkah were
as follows. As soon as the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) began to
preach the message of Islam, it seemed as though he had provoked all
classes of the people around him. As his message spread the
opposition of the disbelieving Quraish also became more and more
intense. As long as they had any hope that they would be able to
prevent him from preaching his message by throwing some temptation in
his way, or striking some bargain with him, their hostility did not
become very active. But when the Holy Prophet disappointed them
completely that he would not effect any kind of compromise with them
in the matter of faith, and in Surah Al-Kafirun they were plainly
told: &quot;I do not worship those who you worship nor are you
worshipers of Him Whom I worship. For you is your religion and for me
is mine&quot;, the hostility touched its extreme limits. More
particularly, the families whose members (men or women, boys or
girls) had accepted Islam, were burning with rage from within against
the Holy Prophet. They were cursing him, holding secret consultations
to kill him quietly in the dark of the night so that the Bani Hashim
could not discover the murderer and take revenge; magic and charms
were being worked on him so as to cause his death, or make him fall
ill, or become mad; satans from among the men and the jinn spread on
every side so as to whisper one or another evil into the hearts of
the people against him and the Qur'an brought by him so that they
became suspicious of him and fled him. There were many people who
were burning with jealousy against him, for they could not tolerate
that a man from another family or clan than their own should flourish
and become prominent. For instance, the reason why Abu Jahl was
crossing every limit in his hostility to him has been explained by
himself: &quot;We and the Bani Abdi Manaf (to which the Holy Prophet
belonged) were rivals of each other: they fed others, we too fed
others; they provided conveyances to the people, we too did the same;
they gave donations, we too gave donations, so much so that when they
and we have become equal in honor and nobility, they now proclaim
that they have a Prophet who is inspired from the heaven; how can we
compete with them in this field? By God, we will never acknowledge
him, nor affirm faith in him&quot;. (</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ibn

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Such
were the conditions when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was
commanded to tell the people: &quot;I seek refuge with the Lord of
the dawn, from the evil of everything that He has created, and from
the evil of the darkness of night and from the evil of magicians, men
and women, and from the evil of the envious&quot;, and to tell them:
&quot;I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind, the King of mankind,
and the Deity of mankind, from the evil of the whisperer, who returns
over and over again, who whispers (evil) into the hearts of men,
whether he be from among the jinn or men.&quot; This is similar to
what the Prophet Moses had been told to say when Pharaoh had
expressed his design before his full court to kill him: &quot;I have
taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord against every arrogant person
who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.&quot; (Al-Mu'min: 27).
And: &quot;I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord lest you
should assail me.&quot; (Ad-Dukhan;20). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On
both occasions these illustrious Prophets of Allah were confronted
with well-equipped, resourceful and powerful enemies. On both
occasions they stood firm on their message of Truth against their
strong opponents, whereas they had no material power on the strength
of which they could fight them, and on both occasions they utterly
disregarded the threats and dangerous plans and hostile devices of
the enemy, saying: &quot;We have taken refuge with the Lord of the
universe against you.&quot; Obviously, such firmness and
steadfastness can be shown only by the person who has the conviction
that the power of His Lord is the supreme power, that all powers of
the world are insignificant against Him, and that no one can harm the
one who has taken His refuge. Only such a one can say: &quot;I will
not give up preaching the Word of Truth. I care the least for what
you may say or do, for I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord
and Lord of all universe.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">and commentary concerning these Surahs
have been discussed, which are likely to create doubts in the minds,
it is necessary to clear them also here. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">First,
whether it is absolutely established that these two Surahs are the
Qur'anic Surahs, or whether there is some doubt in this regard. This
question arose because in the traditions related from an illustrious
Companion like Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, it has been said that he
did not regard these two Surahs as the Surahs of the Qur'an and had
eliminated these from his copy of the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mushaf</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
Imam Ahmad, Bazzar, Tabarani, Ibn Marduyah, Abu Ya'la, Abdullah bin
Ahmad bin Hanbal, Humaydi, Abu Nu'aim, Ibn Hibban and other
traditionists have related this from Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud with
different chains of transmitters and mostly on sound authority.
According to these traditions, he not only eliminated these Surahs
from the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mushaf</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">but it has also been reported that he
used to say: &quot;Do not mix up with the Qur'an that which is not of
the Qur'an. These two Surahs are not included in the Quran. This was
only a command enjoined on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) for
seeking God's refuge.&quot; In some traditions there is also the
addition that he did not recite these Surahs in the Prayer. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">On
the basis of these traditions the opponents of Islam had an
opportunity to raise doubts about the Qur'an, saying that this Book,
God forbid, is not free from corruption. For when, according to a
Companion of the rank of Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, these two Surahs
are an annexation to the Qur'an, many other additions and
subtractions also might have been made in it. To rid the Qur'an of
this blame Qadi Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, Qadi Iyad and others took the
stand that Ibn Mas'ud was not in fact a denier of the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mu'awwidhatayn</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

For, according to him, only that which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) had allowed, should be written in the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mushaf</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
and Ibn Mas'ud did not receive the information that the Holy Prophet
had allowed this. But this stand is not correct, for according to
sound evidence, it is confirmed that Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased
with him) had denied that these were Surahs of the Qur'an. Some other
scholars, for instance, Imam Nawawi, Imam Ibn Hazm and Imam
Fakhr-ud-din Razi, regard this as a pure lie and falsehood that Ibn
Mas'ud had asserted any such thing. But to reject genuine historical
facts without sound evidence is unscientific. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

Hubaish, with a slight variation in wording from Hadrat Ubayy bin

of his knowledge of the Qur'an. Zirr bin Hubaish states: &quot;I said
to Hadrat Ubayy: Your brother, Abdullah bin Mas'ud, says these

But he did not feel any need to question the Holy Prophet about it.
In the mind of Hadrat Ubbay bin Kab also a question arose about his
and he put it before the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet replied:
&quot;Since Gabriel (peace be on him) had said </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">qul</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,

Let us put it like this. If somebody is commanded and asked: &quot;Say,
I seek refuge&quot;, he will not carry out the command, saying: &quot;Say,
I seek refuge&quot;, but he will drop the work &quot;say&quot; and
say: &quot;I seek refuge.&quot; On the contrary, if the messenger of
a superior officer conveys to somebody the message in these words:
&quot;Say, I seek refuge&quot;, and this command is given to him not
only for his own person but to be conveyed to others, he will convey
the words of the message verbatim to the people, and will not have
the permission to drop anything from the text of the message. Thus,
the fact that these two Surahs begin with the word </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">qul</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">is a clear proof that it is Divine
Word, which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was bound to convey
verbatim. It was not merely a command given to him for his person.
Besides these two Surahs, there are 330 other verses in the Qur'an
which begin with the word </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">qul</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

what he was commanded to say. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

if one considers this, one can understand fully well how unreasonable
it is to regard the Companions as infallible and to make the clamor
that a Companion has been defamed as soon as one hears a saying or
doing of his being described as wrong. Here, one can clearly see what
a blunder happened to be committed by an illustrious Companion like
Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud about two Surahs of the Qur'an. If such an
error could be committed by an eminent Companion like him, others
also might commit an error. We can examine it in the scientific way,
and describe it as wrong if a thing said or done by a Companion is
proved to be wrong. But wicked indeed would be the person who went
beyond describing a wrong act as wrong and started reproving and
finding fault with the Companions of the Holy Prophet of Allah.

of Holy Prophet's being affected by Magic</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
second thing that has arisen in respect of these two Surahs is that,
according to traditions, magic had been worked on the Holy Prophet,
and he had fallen ill under its effect, and Gabriel (peace be on him)
had instructed him to repeat these Surahs to remove the charm. This
has been objected to by many rationalists of both ancient and modern
times. They say that if these traditions are accepted, the whole

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">becomes doubtful. For if the Prophet
could be charmed, and according to these traditions he was charmed,
one cannot say what the Prophet might have been made to say and do
under the influence of magic by his opponents, and what in his
teaching may be Divine and what the result of magic. Not only this:
they also allege that if this is accepted as true, it might well be
that the Prophet might have been prompted to make the claim to
Prophethood through magic and the Prophet by misunderstanding might
have thought that an angel had come to him. They also argue that
these traditions clash with the Qur'an. The Qur'an mentions the
accusation of the disbelievers who said that the Prophet was
bewitched (Bani Isra'il: 47), but these traditions confirm the
accusation of the disbelievers that the Prophet had actually been
charmed and bewitched. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For
a proper investigation of this question it is necessary that one
should first see whether it is established by authentic historical
evidence that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had actually been
affected by magic, and if so, what it was and to what extent. Then it
should be seen whether the objections raised against what is
established historically do actually apply to it or not. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Muslim scholars of the earliest period were truly honest and upright
in that they did not try to corrupt history or conceal facts
according to their own ideas, concepts and assumptions. They conveyed
intact to the later generations whatever was confirmed historically,

used by the one who was bent upon drawing perverse conclusions from
the facts. Now, if something stands confirmed by authentic and
historical means, it is neither right for an honest and right-minded
person that he should deny history on the ground that in case he
accepted it, it would lead to these evil results according to his
thinking, nor it is right that he should add to and stretch beyond
its genuine limits by conjecture and speculation whatever is

we give it below as a connected event from the details provided by

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
the peace treaty of Hudaibiyah when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) returned to Madinah, a deputation of the Jews of Khaibar
visited Madinah in Muharram, A.H. 7 and met a famous magician, Labid
bin Asam, who belonged to the Ansar tribe of Bani Zurayq. They said
to him: &quot;You know how Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
blessings) has treated us. We have tried our best to bewitch him but
have not succeeded. Now we have come to you because you are a more
skilled magician. Here are three gold coins, accept these and cast a
powerful magic spell on Muhammad.&quot; In those days the Holy
Prophet had a Jewish boy as his attendant. Through him they obtained
a piece of the Holy Prophet's comb with some hair stuck to it. Magic
was worked on the same hair and the teeth of the comb. According to
some traditions, magic was worked by Labid bin Asam himself,
according to others, his sisters were more skilled than him and he
got the spell cast through them. Whatever be the case, Labid placed
this spell in the spathe of a male date-tree and his it under a stone
at the bottom of Dharwan or Dhi Arwan, the well of Bani Zurayq. The
spell took one whole year to have effect upon the Holy Prophet (upon
whom be peace). In the latter half of the year the Holy Prophet
started feeling as if was unwell. The last forty days became hard on
him, of which the last three days were even harder. But its maximum
effect on him was that he way melting away from within. He thought he
had done a thing whereas, in fact, he had not done it: he thought he
had visited his wives whereas he had not visited them; and sometimes
he would doubt having seen something whereas, in fact, he had not
seen it. All these effects were confined to his own person; so much
so that the other people could not notice what state he was passing
through. As for his being a Prophet, no change occurred in the
performance of his duties. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">There
is no tradition to say that he might have forgotten some verses of
the Qur'an in those days, or might have recited a verse wrongly, or a
change might have occurred in the assemblies and in his counsels and
sermons, or he might have presented a discourse as Revelation which
may not have been revealed to him, or he might have missed a Prayer
and thought that he had performed it. God forbid, if any such thing
had happened, it would have caused a clamor and the whole of Arabia
would have known that a magician had overpowered the one whom no
power had been able to overpower. But the Holy Prophet's position as
a Prophet remained wholly unaffected by it. Only in his personal life
he remained worried on account of it. At last, one day when he was in
the house of Hadrat Aishah, he prayed to Allah to be restored to full
health. In the meantime he fell asleep or drowsed and on waking he
said to Hadrat Aishah: &quot;My Lord has told me what I had asked of
Him.&quot; Hadrat Aishah asked what it was. He replied: &quot;Two men
(i.e. two angels in human guise) came to me. One sat near my head and
the other near my feet. The first asked: what has happened to him?
The other replied: Magic has been worked on him. The first asked: who
has worked it? He replied: Labid bin Asam. He asked: In what is it
contained? He replied: In the comb and hair covered in the spathe of
a male date-tree. He asked: where is it? He replied: under a stone at
the bottom of Dhi Arwan (or Dharwan), the well of Bani Zurayq. He
asked: what should be done about it? He replied: the well should be
emptied and it should be taken out from under the stone. The Holy
Prophet then sent Hadrat Ali, Hadrat Ammar bin Yasir and Hadrat
Zubair: They were also joined by Jubair bin Iyas az-Zurqi (two men
from Bani Zurayq). Later the Holy Prophet also arrived at the well
along with some Companions. The water was taken out and the spathe
recovered. There they found that beside the comb and hair there was a
cord with eleven knots on it and a wax image with needles pricked
into it. Gabriel (peace be on him) came and told him to repeat the
</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mu'awwidhatayn</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
As he repeated verse after verse, a knot was loosened and a needle
taken out every time, till on finishing the last words all the knots
were loosened and all the needles removed, and he was entirely freed
from the charm. After this he called Labid and questioned him. He
confessed his guilt and the Holy Prophet let him go, for he never
avenged himself on anyone for any harm done to his person. He even
declined to talk about it to others, saying that Allah had restored
him to health; therefore he did not like that he should incite the
people against anyone. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">This
is the story of the magic worked on the Holy Prophet. There if
nothing in it which might run counter to his office of Prophethood.
In his personal capacity if any injury could be inflicted on him as
it happened in the Battle of Uhud, if he could fall from his horse
and be hurt as is confirmed by the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hadith</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
if he could be stung by a scorpion as has been mentioned in some
Traditions and none of these negates the protection promised him by
Allah in his capacity as a Prophet, he could also fall ill under the
influence of magic in his personal capacity. That a Prophet can be
affected by magic is also confirmed by the Qur'an. In Surah Al- A'raf
it has been said about the magicians of Pharaoh that when they
confronted the Prophet Moses, they bewitched the eyes of thousands of
people who had assembled to witness the encounter (v. 116). In Surah
Ta Ha it has been said that not only the common people but the
Prophet Moses too felt that the cords and staffs that they cast were
running towards them like so many snakes, and this filled Moses'
heart with fear. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: &quot;Don't fear
for you will come out victorious. Cast down you staff.&quot; (vv.
66-69). As for the objection that this then confirms the accusation
of the disbelievers of Makkah that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) was a bewitched man, its answer is that the disbelievers did
not call him a bewitched man in the sense that he had fallen ill
under that effect of magic cast by somebody, but in the sense that
some magician has, God forbid, made him mad, and he had made claim to
Prophethood and was telling the people tales of Hell and Heaven in
his same madness. Now, obviously this objection does not at all apply
to a matter about which history confirms that the magic spell had
affected only the person of Muhammad (upon whom be peace) and not the
Prophethood of Muhammad (upon whom be peace), which remained wholly
unaffected by it. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this connection, another thing worthy of mention is that the people
who regard magic as a kind of superstition hold this view only
because the effect of magic cannot be explained scientifically. But
there are many things in the world which one experiences and observes
but one cannot explain scientifically how they happen. If we cannot
give any such explanation it does not become necessary that we should
deny the thing itself which we cannot explain. Magic, in fact, is a
psychological phenomenon which can affect the body through the mind
just as physical things affect the mind through the body. Fear, for
instance, is a psychological phenomenon, but it affects the body: the
hair stand on end and the body shudders. Magic does not; in fact,
change the reality, but under its influence man's mind and senses
start feeling as if reality had changed. The staffs and the cords
that the magicians had thrown towards the Prophet Moses, had not
actually become snakes, but the eyes of the multitude of people were
so bewitched that everybody felt they were snakes; even the senses of
the Prophet Moses could not remain unaffected by the magic spell.
Likewise, in Al-Baqarah: 102, it has been said that in Babylon people
learned such magic from Harut and Marut as could cause division
between husband and wife. This too was a psychological phenomenon.
Obviously, if the people did not find it efficacious by experience
they could not become its customers. No doubt, it is correct that
just like the bullet of the rifle and the bomb from the aircraft,
magic too cannot have effect without Allah's permission, but it would
be mere stubbornness to deny a thing which has been experienced and
observed by man for thousands for years. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

for every disease and exhorted his followers to use cures. He himself
told the people the remedies for certain diseases, as can be seen in

otherwise if the cure and medical treatment were beneficial in every
case, no one would have died in hospitals. Now, if beside the cure
and medical treatment, Allah's Word and His beautiful names also are
made use of, or Word and His beautiful names also are made use of, or
Allah is turned to and invoked for help by means of His Word, Names
and Attributes in a place where no medical aid is available, it would
not be against reason except for the materialists. However, it is not
right to disregard intentionally a cure or treatment where it is
available, and recourse had only to enchanting and reciting of
charms, and the people should start a regular practice of granting
amulets as a means of earning their livelihood. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Many
people in this regard argue from Hadrat Abu Said Khudri's tradition
which has been related in Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad,
Abu Daud and Ibn Majah, and it is supported also by a tradition
related in Bukhari on the authority of Ibn Abbas. According to it the
Holy Prophet sent some of his Companions including Hadrat Abu Said
Khudri on an expedition. They halted on the way at the settlement of
an Arabian tribe and demanded hospitality from the people, but they
refused to extend any hospitality. In the meantime the chief of the
tribe was stung by a scorpion and the people came to the travelers to
ask if they had any medicine or formula by which their chief could be
cured. Hadrat Abu Said said: &quot;Yes, we do have, but since you
have refused us hospitality, we would not treat him unless you
promised us to give us something.&quot; They promised to give them a
flock of goats (according to some traditions, 30 goats), and Hadrat
Abu Said went and started reciting Surah Al-Fatihah and rubbing his
saliva on the affected place. Consequently, the chief felt relieved
of the effect of the poison and the people of the tribe gave them the
goats as promised. But the Companions said to one another; &quot;Let
us not make any use of the goats until we have asked the Holy Prophet
about it&quot;, for they were not sure whether it was permissible to
accept any reward for what they had done. So they came before the
Holy Prophet and related what had happened. The Holy Prophet smiled
and said: &quot;How did you know that Surah Al-Fatihah could also be
used for curing such troubles? Take the goats and allocate my share
also in it.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">for permission to adopt a regular
profession of granting amulets and reciting charms, one should keep
in view the conditions under which Hadrat Abu Said Khudri had
recourse to it, and the Holy Prophet not only held it as permissible
but also said that a share for him also should be allocated so that
there remained no doubt in the minds of the Companions that such a
thing was permissible. The conditions in Arabia in those days were,
as they still are, that settlements were situated hundreds of miles
apart, there were not hotels and restaurants where a traveler could
buy food when he reached one of these after several days journey.
Under such conditions it was considered a moral duty that when a
traveler reached a settlement the people of the place should extend
hospitality to him. Refusal on their part in many cases meant death
for the travelers, and this was looked upon as highly blameworthy
among the Arabs. That is why the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
allowed as permissible the act of his Companions. Since the people of
the tribe had refused them hospitality, they too refused to treat
their chief, and became ready to treat him only on the condition that
they should promise to give them something in return. Then, when one
of them with trust in God recited Surah Al-Fatihah over the chief and
he became well, the people gave the promised wages and the Holy
Prophet allowed that the wages be accepted as lawful and pure. In
Bukhari the tradition related on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin
Abbas about this incident contains the Holy Prophet's words to the
effect: &quot;Instead that you should have acted otherwise, it was
better that you recited the Book of Allah and accepted the wages for
it.&quot; He said this in order to impress the truth that Allah's
Word is superior to every other kind of enchanting and practice of
secret arts. Furthermore, the Message also was incidentally conveyed
to the Arabian tribe and its people made aware of the blessings of
the Word that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had brought from
Allah. This incident cannot be cited as a precedent for the people
who run clinic in the cities and towns for the practice of secret
arts and have adopted it as a regular profession for earning
livelihood. No precedent of it is found in the life and practice of
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) or his Companions, their
followers and the earliest Imams. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

chronologically, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) arranged in
the present order the verses and Surahs revealed during 23 years on

himself but by the command of Allah Who revealed them. According to

Now, let us have a look at the two. In the beginning, after praising
and glorifying Allah, Who is Lord of the worlds, Kind, Merciful and
Master of the Judgment Day, the servants submits: &quot;Lord, You
alone I worship and to You along I turn for help, and the most urgent
help that I need from You is to be guided to the Straight Way.&quot;
In answer, he is given by Allah the whole Qur'an to show him the
Straight Way, which is concluded thus: Man prays to Allah, Who is
Lord of dawn, Lord of men, King of men, Deity of men, saying: &quot;I
seek refuge only with You for protection from every evil and mischief
of every creature, and in particular, from the evil whisperings of
devils, be they from among men or jinn, for they are the greatest
obstacle in following the Straight Way.&quot; The relation that the
beginning bears with the end, cannot remain hidden from anyone who
has understanding and insight. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>The
	act of seeking refuge necessarily consists of three parts: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)The
	act of seeking refuge itself; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) the
	seeker of refuge; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) he
	whose refuge is sought. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Seeking
	refuge implies feeling fear of something and seeking protection of
	another, or taking cover of it, or clinging to it, or going under
	its shelter for safety. The seeker after refuge in any case is the
	person, who feels that he cannot by himself resist and fight the
	thing that he fears, but stands in need of refuge with another for
	protection. Then the one whose refuge is sought must necessarily be
	a person or being about whom the seeker after refuge believes that
	he or it alone can protect him from the calamity. Now, one kind of
	refuge is that which is obtained according to natural laws in the
	physical world from a perceptible material object or person or
	power, for example, taking shelter in a fort for protection against
	the enemy's attack, or taking cover in a trench or behind a heap of
	earth, or wall, for protection against a shower of bullets, or
	taking refuge with a man or government, for protection from a
	powerful tyrant or taking refuge in the shade of a tree or building
	for protection from the sun. Contrary to this, the other kind of
	refuge is that which is sought in a supernatural Being from every
	kind of danger and every kind of material, moral or spiritual harm
	and injury on the basis of the belief that that Being is ruler over
	the physical world and can protect in supersensory ways the one who
	seeks His refuge. This second kind of refuge is the one that is
	implied not only in Surah AI-Falaq and Surah An-Nas but wherever in
	the Qur'an and the Hadith mention has been made of seeking refuge
	with Allah, it implies this particular kind of refuge, and it is a
	necessary corollary of the doctrine of Tauhid that this kind of
	refuge should be sought from no one but Allah. The polytheists
	sought this kind of protection, and seek even today, from other
	beings than Allah, e.g. the jinn, or gods and goddesses. The
	materialists turn for this also to material means and resources, for
	they do not believe in any supernatural power. But the believer only
	turns to Allah and seeks refuge only with Him, against all such
	calamities and misfortunes to ward off which he feels he has no
	power. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">For
	example, about the polytheists it has been said in the Qur'an: &quot;And
	that from among men some people used to seek refuge with some people
	from among the jinn (Al-Jinn: 16).&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And
	explaining it in E.N. 47 of Surah Al-Jinn we have cited Hadrat
	`Abdullah bin 'Abbas's tradition that when the polytheistic Arabs
	had to pass a night in an uninhabited valley, they would call out,
	saying: We seek refuge of the lord of this valley (i.e. of the jinn
	who is ruler and master of this valley).&quot; Contrary to this,
	about Pharaoh it has been said: &quot;When he witnessed the great
	Signs presented by the Prophet Moses, he showed arrogance on account
	of his might.&quot; (Adh-Dhariyat: 39). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the attitude and conduct of the God-worshipers the Qur'an says that
	they seek Allah's refuge for protection against the evil of
	everything that they fear, whether it is material or moral or
	spiritual. Thus, about Mary it has been said that when God's angel
	appeared before her suddenly in human guise (when she did not know
	that he was an angel), she cried out: &quot;I seek the merciful
	God's refuge from you, if you are a pious man.&quot; (Mary: 18). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When the
	Prophet Noah made an improper petition to Allah, and was rebuked by
	Allah in response, he immediately submitted: &quot;My Lord, I seek
	Your protection lest I should ask of You anything of which I have no
	knowledge.&quot; (Hud: 47) When the Prophet Moses commanded the
	children of Israel to sacrifice a cow, and they said that perhaps he
	was having a jest with them, he replied: &quot;I crave Allah's
	protection from behaving like ignorant people.&quot; (Al-Baqarah:
	67)

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The same
	is the case with all the acts of seeking refuge which have been
	reported in respect of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) in the

	the Holy Prophet made:

	not do.&quot; (i.e. if I have done a wrong, I seek refuge from its
	evil results, and if I have not done a work which I should have
	done, I seek refuge from the loss that 1 have incurred, or from that
	I should do what I should not do).&quot; (Muslim)

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Ibn Umar

	front being deprived of the well-being that You have granted me and
	I seek refuge lest Your wrath should descend on me suddenly, and 1

</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>The
	word used in the original is Rabbul- Falaq. Falaq actually means to
	split and to pierce through. A great majority of the commentators
	have taken it to mean bringing out the light of dawn by splitting
	the darkness of night, for in Arabic falaq as-subh is often used for
	the breaking of dawn, and in the Qur'an also the words
	:Faliq-ul-isbah (He Who causes the dawn to appear by splitting the
	darkness of night) have been used for Allah. (Al-An'am: 96). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	meaning of falaq also is to create, to bring into being, for
	everything created in the world appears by splitting something. All
	vegetation sprouts by splitting open the seed and the soil; all
	animals come out either from the womb of mother or by breaking open
	the egg, or some other obstruction. All springs gush out by
	splitting open the rock or soil. The day appears by piercing through
	the curtain of the night. The drops of rain pierce through the
	clouds and fall on the earth. In short, everything in the world
	comes into being as a result of breaking and splitting another
	thing; so much so that the earth and the heavens also in the
	beginning were one mass, then they were broken and parted.
	(Al-Anbiya': 30). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus,
	according to this meaning the word falaq is common to all creations.
	Now, if the first meaning is adopted, the verse would mean: &quot;I
	seek refuge with the Lord of rising dawn&quot;, and according to the
	second meaning, it would mean: &quot;I seek refuge with the Lord of
	all creation.&quot; Here the attribute of &quot;Rabb&quot; has been
	used for Allah instead of His proper Name, for Allah's attribute of
	being Rabb, i. e. Master, Sustainer and Providence, is more relevant
	to seeking and taking of His refuge. Then, if Rabbtrl-falaq implies
	Lord of the rising dawn, seeking His refuge would mean: &quot;I seek
	refuge with the Lord Who brings out the bright daylight from the
	darkness of night so that He may likewise bring well-being for me
	from all kinds of physical and psychical dangers.&quot; If it is
	taken to mean Rabb al-khalaq the meaning would be: &quot;1 seek
	refuge with the Lord of all creation, so that He may protect me from
	the evil of His creation.&quot;&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote4">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>In
	other words: &quot;I seek His refuge from the evil of all
	creatures.&quot; A few things in this sentence deserve
	consideration; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that the creation of evil has not been attributed to Allah, but the
	creation of creatures has been attributed to Allah and of evil to
	the creatures. That is, it has not been said: &quot;I seek refuge
	from the evils that Allah has created&quot; but that &quot;I seek
	refuge from the evil of the things He has created.&quot; This shows
	that Allah has not created any creature for the sake of evil, but
	all His work is for the sake of good and a special purpose. However,
	from the qualities that He has created in the creatures to fulfill
	the purpose of their creation, sometimes evil appears from some
	kinds of creatures in most cases. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second,
	that even if this one sentence was given and no mention made of
	seeking Allah's refuge separately from the evils of some particular
	kinds of creatures in the following sentences, this one sentence
	alone would have sufficed to express the intent, for in it Allah's
	refuge has been sought from the evil of all creatures. After this
	general prayer for refuge making mention of seeking refuge from some
	particular evils by itself gives this meaning: &quot;Though I seek
	Allah's refuge from the evil of everything created by Allah, I stand
	in great need of Allah's refuge from the particular evils that have
	been mentioned in the remaining verses of Surah Al-Falaq and Surah
	An-Nas.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Third,
	that the most suitable and effective prayer for seeking refuge from
	the evil of the creatures is that refuge should be sought with their
	Creator, for He is in any case dominant over His creatures and is
	aware of their evils, which we know, as well as of those which we do
	not know. Hence, His refuge is the refuge of the supreme Ruler Whom
	no power can fight and oppose, and with His refuge we can protect
	ourselves from every evil of every creature, whether we are aware of
	it or not. Moreover, this contains the prayer for refuge not only
	from the evils of the world but also from every evil of the
	Hereafter. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Fourth,
	that the word sharr (evil) is used for loss, injury, trouble and
	affliction as well as for the means which cause losses and injuries
	and afflictions; for example, hunger, disease, injury in accident or
	war, being burnt by fire, being stung or bitten by a scorpion or
	snake, being involved in the grief of children's death and similar
	other evils which are evils in the first sense, for they are by
	themselves troubles and afflictions. Contrary to this, unbelief,
	polytheism and every kind of sin and wickedness, for instance, are
	evils in the second sense, for they cause loss and affliction,
	although apparently they do not cause any trouble at the moment,
	rather some sins give pleasure and bring profit. Thus, seeking
	refuge from evil comprehends both these meanings. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Fifth,
	that seeking refuge from evil contains two other meanings also.
	First, that man is praying to his God to protect him from the evil
	that has already taken place; second, that man is praying to his God
	to protect him from the evil that has not yet taken place.&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote5">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>After
	seeking Allah's refuge generally from the evil of the creatures, now
	prayer is being taught for seeking refuge from the evil of some
	special creatures in particular. The word ghasiq in the verse
	literally means dark. Thus, at another place in the Qur'an it has
	been said: &quot;establish the salat from the declining of the sun
	to the darkness of the night (ila ghasaq-il- lain.&quot; (Bani
	lsra'il: 78), and wagab means to enter or to overspread. Prayer has
	been taught to seek refuge in particular from the evil of the
	darkness of night, for most of the crimes and acts of wickedness are
	committed at night, harmful animals also come out at night, and the
	night was a very dreadful thing in the days chaos prevailed in
	Arabia when these verses were revealed. Raiders came out in the dark
	of night and plundered and destroyed settlements. The people who
	were thinking of putting the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) to
	death, also made their secret plans at night, so that the murder
	could not be detected. Therefore, command was given to seek Allah's
	refuge from the evils and calamities which descend at night. Here,
	the subtle relation that exists between seeking refuge from the evil
	of the dark night with the Lord of breaking dawn cannot remain
	hidden from anybody having insight and understanding. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A
	difficulty is confronted in the explanation of this verse' in view
	of several authentic traditions. Hadrat `A'ishah has reported: &quot;Once
	during a moon-lit night, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) look
	hold of my hand and pointing to the moon said: `Seek Allah's refuge,
	for this is al ghasiq idha wagab'. (Tirmidhi, Ahmad, Nasa'i, lbn
	Jarir, Ibn al-Mundhir, Hakim, Ibn Marduyah). To explain this some
	scholars said that idha wagab here means idha khasaf, i. e. when the
	moon is eclipsed. But in no tradition has it been mentioned that
	when the Holy Prophet pointed to the moon, it was in eclipse. In the
	Arabic lexicon also idha wagab cannot mean idha khalaf. In our
	opinion the correct explanation of this Hadith is that since the
	moon rises in the night (in the daytime it does not shine even if it
	is there in the sky), what the Holy Prophet meant was this: 'Seek
	God's refuge from the night, the time when it (the moon) appears,
	for the light of the moon is not as helpful for the one who resists
	as for the one who attacks, and not as helpful for the victim of the
	crime as for the culprit.' On this very basis the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be peace) is reported to have said: &quot;When the sun has set,
	devils scatter on every side. Therefore, gather your children
	together in the house and keep your animals tied down until the
	darkness of night disappears.&quot;&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote6">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote6sym" HREF="#sdfootnote6anc">6</A>The
	word ' uqad in naffathat frl-'eqad is plural of 'uqdah, which means
	a knot that is tied on a string or piece of thread. Nafath means to
	blow. Naftathat is plural of naffathah, which may mean the men who
	blow much, and if taken as a feminine gender, women who blow much;
	it may as well relate to nufus (human beings) or to jama ats (groups
	of men), for both nafas and jama 'at are grammatically feminine.
	Blowing upon knots, according to most, rather all, commentators
	implies magic, for the magicians usually tie knots on a string or
	thread and blow upon them as they do so. Thus, the verse means: &quot;I
	seek refuge with the Lord of rising dawn from the evil of magicians,
	male and female.&quot; This meaning is also supported by the
	traditions which show that when magic was worked on the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace), Gabriel (peace be on him) had come and taught
	hint to recite the Mu awwidhatayn, and in the Mu'awwidhatayn this is
	the only sentence which relates directly to magic. Abu Muslim
	Isfahani and Zamakhshari have given another meaning also of
	naffathat fil-'uqad, which is that it implies the deceitfulness of
	women and their influencing men's resolutions, views and ideas and
	this has been compared to a magic spell, for in the love of women
	man starts behaving as if he was under a spell. Though this
	explanation is interesting, it runs counter to the commentary given
	by the earliest scholars; and it also does not correspond to the
	conditions in which the Mu'awwidhatayn were sent down as we have
	shown in the Introduction. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">About
	magic one should know that in it since help is sought of the satans
	and evil spirits or stars to influence the other person evilly, it
	has been called kufr (unbelief) in the Qur'an: &quot;Solomon was not
	involved in kufr but the satans who taught tragic to the people.&quot;
	(AI-Baqarah: 102). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But even
	if it does not contain any word of kufr, or any polytheistic
	element, it is forbidden and unlawful and the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be peace) has counted it among the seven heinous sins which
	ruin the Hereafter of man. In Bukhari and Muslim a tradition has
	been related from Hadrat Abu Hurairah, saying that the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) said: &quot;Avoid seven deadly sins:
	associating another with Allah, magic, killing a soul, which Allah
	has forbidden unjustly, devouring interest, eating the orphan's
	property, fleeing from the enemy in the battlefield, and slandering
	simple and chaste Muslim women with un-chastity.&quot;</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote7">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote7sym" HREF="#sdfootnote7anc">7</A>Hasad
	means that a person should feel unhappy at the better fortune,
	superiority or good quality that Allah has granted to another, and
	should wish that it should be taken away from the other person and
	given to him, or at least the other one should be deprived of it.
	However, hasad does not mean that a person should wish that he too
	should be blessed with the bounty that the other one has been
	blessed with. Here, Allah's refuge has been sought from the evil of
	the jealous one when he feels jealous, and takes a practical step
	with word or deed to satisfy his heart. For until he takes a
	practical step, his being unhappy may by itself be bad but it is not
	an evil for the other person so that he may seek refuge from it.
	When such an evil appears from a jealous person the best thing would
	be to seek Allah's refuge from it. Besides this, there are a few
	other things also which are helpful for obtaining immunity from the
	evil of the jealous person. First, that one should have trust in
	Allah and the faith that unless Allah so wills no one can harm him
	in any way. Second, that one should have patience over what the
	jealous person says and does and should not start behaving
	impatiently so as to be degraded morally to the level of the jealous
	person. Third, that one should in any case maintain dignity and
	practice piety even if the jealous person behaves frivolously, being
	fearless of God and shameless of the people. Fourth, that one should
	free one's mind of every thought about the jealous person and should
	disregard him altogether, for making him a subject of one's thought
	is a prelude to being influenced by him. Fifth, that one should do
	the jealous person a good turn as and when one can, not to speak of
	treating him evilly, no matter whether this good behavior mitigates
	his jealousy or not. Sixth, that one should understand rightly and
	remain steadfast to the doctrine of Tauhid for the heart which
	enshrines Tauhid, cannot be affected by anyone else's fear except
	the fear of Allah.
