bin Muzahim that this Surah was revealed eight years before Surah An

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Surah deals with the doubts and objections that were being raised
against the Qur'an, the Prophethood of Muhammad (Allah's peace and
blessings be upon him) and his teachings by the disbelievers of
Makkah. Appropriate answers to each and every objection have been
given and the people have been warned of the consequences of
rejecting the Truth. At the end of the Surah, a clear picture of the
moral superiority of the Believers has been depicted as in the
beginning of Surah Al-Mu'minun, as if to say, 'Here is the criterion
for distinguishing the genuine from the counterfeit. This is the
noble character of those people who have believed in and followed the
teachings of the Holy Prophet and this is the kind of people that he
is trying to train. You may yourselves compare and contrast this type
of people with those Arabs, who have not as yet accepted the Message,
and who are upholding &quot;ignorance&quot; and exerting their utmost
to defeat the Truth. Now you may judge for yourselves as to which you
would like to choose.&quot; Though this question was not posed in so
many words, it was placed before every one in Arabia in a tangible
shape. It may be noted that during the next few years, the practical
answer given to this question by the whole nation, with the exception
of a small minority, was that they chose Islam. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	is the same objection which the modern orientalists have raised
	against the Qur'an, but strange as it may seem, no contemporary of

	a boy had met Buhairah, the monk, and had attained religious
	knowledge from him, nor did anybody claim that he had obtained all
	that information from the Christian monks and Jewish rabbis during

	never traveled alone but in the caravans and if they said such a
	thing, it would be refuted by hundreds of their own people from the
	city. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then, one
	could ask, if he had gained all that knowledge from Buhairah when he
	was about 12, and during trade journeys when he was 25, why did he
	keep it secret from the people till he became 40? whereas he did not
	leave his country even for a single day, but lived for years among
	his own people in the same city. That is why the people of Makkah
	dared not bring such an impudent and baseless charge against him.
	Their objections related to the time when he claimed to be a Prophet
	of Allah and not to the time preceding that claim. Their argument
	was like this: &quot;This man is illiterate and cannot obtain any
	knowledge through books. He has lived among us for forty years, but
	we have never heard from him anything that might have shown that he
	had any acquaintance with what he is preaching; therefore he must
	have had the help of other people who copied these things from the
	writings of the ancients for him: he learns these things from them
	and recites them as Divine Revelations: this is a fraud.&quot; So
	much so that according to some traditions, they named some of his
	&quot;helpers&quot;, who were the people of the Book, were
	illiterate and lived in Makkah. They were: (1) Addas, a freed slave
	of Huvaitib bin `Abdul `Uzza(2) Yasar, a freed slave of 'Ala bin Al
	Hadrami, and (3) Jabr, a freed slave of `Amir bin Rabbi`ah .</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Apparently
	this is a weighty argument. For there can be no greater proof of the
	&quot;fraud&quot; of Prophethood than to specify its source. But it
	looks strange that no argument has been put forward to refute this
	charge except a mere denial, as if to say, &quot;Your charge is an
	impudent lie: you are cruel and unjust to bring such a false charge
	against Our Messenger; for the Qur'an is the Word of Allah Who knows
	all the secrets in the heavens and the earth. &quot; Had their
	charge been based on facts, it would not have been rejected with
	contempt, for in that case the disbelievers would have demanded a
	detailed and clear answer. But they realized the strength of the
	arguments and did not make such a demand. Moreover, the fact that
	the &quot;weighty&quot; argument failed to produce any doubt in the
	minds of the new Muslims, was a clear proof that it was a lie. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	enigma is clearly explained if we keep in view the prevalent
	circumstances 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	disbelievers of Makkah did not take any decisive steps to prove
	their charge, although they could, had there been any truth in their
	charge. For instance, they could have made raids on the houses of
	the alleged helpers and on the house of the Holy Prophet himself and
	taken hold of the whole &quot;material&quot; which was being used in
	this &quot;fraud&quot;, and made it public to expose his
	Prophethood. And this was not difficult for them because they never
	hesitated to resort to anything to defeat him, including
	persecution, as they were not bound by any moral code. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	alleged helpers were not strangers. As they lived in Makkah,
	everyone knew it well how learned they were. The disbelievers
	themselves knew that they could never have helped to produce a
	unique and sublime Book like the Qur'an which had the highest
	literary excellence and merit. That is why none of them challenged
	the answer to the charge. That is why even those people, who did not
	know them, considered this frivolous. Then if the alleged helpers
	were such geniuses, why did they not claim to be prophets
	themselves? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) Then,
	all the alleged helpers were freed slaves who were attached&quot;to
	their former masters even after their freedom according to the
	customs of Arabia; therefore they could not have become willing
	accomplices of the Holy Prophet in this &quot;fraud&quot; of false
	prophethood because their former masters could have coerced them to
	expose it. The only reason for them to help the Holy Prophet in his
	claim could have been some greed or interest which, under the
	circumstances, could not even be imagined. Thus, apparently there
	was no reason why they should have offended those whose protection
	and patronage they needed and enjoyed, and become accomplices in the
	&quot;fraud&quot;.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) Above
	all, all these alleged helpers embraced Islam. Could it be possible
	that those very persons, who had helped the Holy Prophet to make his
	&quot;fraud&quot; successful, could have possibly become his devoted
	followers? Moreover, if, for the sake of argument, it be admitted
	that they helped him, why was not any of them raised to a prominent
	rank as a reward of his help? Why were not 'Addas and Yasar and Jabr
	exalted to the same status as were Abu Bakr and 'Umar and Abu
	'Ubaidah? Another odd flung is that if the &quot;fraud&quot; of
	prophethood was being carried on with the help of the alleged
	helpers, how could it remain hidden from Zaid bin Harithah, 'AIi bin
	Abi Talib, Abu Bakr and other people, who were the Holy Prophet's
	closest and most devoted Companions? Thus the charge was not only
	frivolous and false, but it was also below the dignity of the Qur'an
	to give any answer to it. The charge has been cited merely to prove
	that those people had been so blinded by their opposition to the
	Truth that they could say anything.</P>

	eat food and walk about in the streets like the common people, or
	that they did not accept your Message of Truth only because you were

	reason why they are putting forward all sorts of absurd arguments to
	reject your Message, is that they do not believe in the
	life-after-death, and this denial has made them free from all moral
	obligations. For when one denies the life-after death, there remains
	no need for him to consider and decide what is true or false, or
	what is right or wrong, etc. Their argument is like this: 'There is
	going to be no life after this one on the earth when we will be
	called to account for our deeds before God. Death will be the end of
	everything, and it will therefore make no difference whether one was
	a worshiper of God or a disbeliever or a mushrik or an atheist When
	the ultimate end is to become one with the dust, there is no need of
	judging what is right and what is wrong except by the criterion of
	&quot;success&quot; and &quot;failure&quot; in this life'. Those who
	deny the Hereafter also see that worldly success or failure does not
	entirely depend upon one's faith or conduct; nay, they very often
	see that the righteous and the wicked persons meet with the same end
	irrespective of their faith for which there is no ordained
	punishment or reward in this life; one righteous person may be
	living a life of hardship while another enjoying all the good things
	of life; one wicked person may be suffering for his misdeeds while
	the other enjoying a life of pleasure and plenty. As such, as far as
	the worldly consequences of adopting a particular moral attitude are
	concerned, the disbelievers in the Hereafter cannot be satisfied
	whether it is right or wrong. In view of this, those who deny the
	Hereafter, do not see any need to consider an invitation to faith

	ma ask the question: How can the promise of the Garden and the
	threat of the Fire produce any effect on the attitude of a parson
	who denies Resurrection and the existence of Paradise and Hell? In
	order to understand the wisdom of this method of admonition, one
	should keep in view that it is meant to appeal to the self-interest
	of an obdurate person, who does not otherwise listen to such
	arguments. This is, as if to say, &quot;Even if, for the sake of
	argument, there is no proof of the reality of the life-after-death,
	there is also no proof that such an event will not occur at all, and
	there is a possibility for both. In the latter case, the Believer
	and the disbeliever both will be in one and the same position, but
	if there is life in the Hereafter, as the Prophet asserts, then the
	disbelievers will be doomed to utter ruin&quot;. Therefore, such an
	approach breaks the stubbornness of the disbelievers and proves to
	be highly effective when the entire scene of Resurrection gathering
	of the people, their accountability and of Hell and Heaven is
	presented in a vivid manner as if the Prophet had himself seen it
	with his own eyes. Fur further explanation, see Ha Mim Sajdah: 52

	was that Allah intended to start a Movement of faith, piety and
	righteousness to combat disbelief, ignorance and sin, and He had
	raised a Prophet to lead and guide the Movement. Then, on the one
	hand, Allah had taken it upon Himself to send necessary instructions

	objections and remove the doubts of opponents and give the right

	revealed by Allah; it was not merely meant to be a code of laws or
	of moral principles, but a Book, which was being sent down piecemeal

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The

	not behave like cattle, as if to say, &quot;If you had considered
	the benefits of the shadow in regard to your everyday experience,
	you would have accepted without any hesitation the Doctrine of
	Tauhid. Had the shadow been constant, there would have been no life
	en earth, for life depends on the light and heat of the sun. On the
	other hand, if there had been no shadow at all, the constant heat
	and light of the sun would have made life impossible. Besides this,
	if there had been sudden changes in the sun and the shadow, they
	would not have been able to endure it for long; therefore you should
	reflect on this phenomenon and understand it well that it has been
	so ordained by the All-Wise and the All-Powerful Creator so that it
	always increases or decreases gradually in accordance with fixed

	and shirk, which appears to have spread far and wide, will begin to
	shorten as the &quot;Sun&quot; of Guidance gradually rises; but it
	requires patience, for Allah never brings about sudden changes.

	of Allah but for mere show. On the other hand, one is miserly if one
	does not spend money for one's own needs and requirements and those
	of one's family in accordance with one's resources and position, or
	if one does not spend money for good works. The way taught by Islam
	is the golden mean between the two extremes. The Holy Prophet has
	said, &quot;It is a sign of wisdom to adopt the &quot;golden mean&quot;
	in one's living.&quot; (Ahmad, Tabarani).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote85sym" HREF="#sdfootnote85anc">84</A>The
	true servants refrain from three great sins: Shirk, murder and
	adultery. The Holy Prophet himself warned of their gravity.
	According to 'Abdullah bin Mas`ud, when some one asked him about the
	worst sins, he replied, (1) &quot;It is to set up someone as equal
	in rank with Allah, Who has created you, (2) to kill your own child
	for fear of its sustenance, and (3) to commit adultery with the wife
	of your neighbour.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmizi, Nasa`i, Ahmad).
	Obviously this is not a complete list of the &quot;heinous sins&quot;.
	But these three instances have been cited because they were most
	prevalent in the Arab society of those days . 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the inclusion of refraining from shirk among the excellences
	of the true servants, one may ask why it should be presented as
	virtue before the disbelievers who did not regard shirk as a vice.
	It is because the Arabs had doubts about the doctrine of shirk even
	though they appeared to be deeply involved in it. This is amply
	supported by their history. For instance, when Abraha invaded
	Makkah, the Quraish did not invoke their idols to save the Ka`bah
	from him, but they begged Allah to save it. Their contemporary
	poetry bears sufficient evidence that they regarded the destruction
	of the &quot;people of the elephant&quot; due to Allah's power and
	supernatural interference and not due to any help of their idols.
	The Quraish and the polytheists of Arabia had also come to know that
	when Abraha reached Ta`if on his way to Makkah, the people of Ta`if
	had offered him their services to destroy the Ka`bah and had even
	provided him guides to take him safely to Makkah through the hills,
	for fear that he might also destroy the temple of &quot;Lat&quot;,
	their chief deity. This event so much offended the Arabs that for
	years after this they continued , pelting the grave of the chief
	guide with stones for retaliation. Moreover, the Quraish and the
	other Arabs attributed their creed to Prophet Abraham and looked
	upon their religious and social customs and their Hajj rites as part
	of Abraham's religion. They knew that Prophet Abraham was a
	worshiper 'of Allah and not of idols. They also had traditions to
	show as to when they had started idol-worship, and which idol had
	been brought from where, when and by whom. The fact is that the
	common Arab did not have much of reverence for his idols. He would
	even speak insultingly of it and withheld his offerings when it
	failed to fulfil his wishes and prayers. For instance, there is the
	story of an Arab who wanted to avenge the murder of his father. He
	went to the temple of his idol, Zul-Khalasah, and wanted to take an
	omen. The response came that he should abandon his intention. At
	this the Arab became furious and cried out: 'O Zul-Khalasah! Had you
	been in my place, and your father was murdered, you would not have
	said that the murderers should not be punished.&quot; Another Arab
	took his herd of camels to the shrine of his god, named Sa'd, for
	seeking its blessings. It was a tall idol which had been smeared
	with sacrificial blood. On seeing it, the camels became terrified
	and started running in all directions. The Arab was so filled with
	rage that he started pelting the idol with stones, shouting, &quot;May
	God destroy you! I had come to you to seek blessings for my camels,
	but you have deprived me of all of them.&quot; There were certain
	idols about whose origin filthy stories were current. For instance,
	the story about Asaf and Na'ilah whose images had been placed at
	Safa and Marwa, was that they were actually a man and a woman, who
	had committed adultery inside the Holy Ka`bah and had been turned
	into stone by God as a punishment. When the deities had such
	reputation, no worshiper could cherish any reverence for them in his
	heart. From this one can easily understand that the Arabs did
	recognize the value of true God-worship deep in their hearts, but,
	on the one hand, it had been suppressed by ancient customs and ways
	of ignorance, and on the other, the priestly class among the Quraish
	had vested interests, who were busy creating prejudices against it
	among the people. They could not give up idol-worship because such a
	step would have brought to an end their supremacy in Arabia. That is
	why, refraining from shirk and worship of One Allah has been
	mentioned as a mark of superiority of the followers of the Holy
	Prophet without any fear of contradiction by the disbelievers, for
	even they in their heart of hearts knew that it was a weighty
	argument against them. &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Many
	instances of such people, who sincerely repented and reformed their
	lives, have been related in the traditions. For instance, Ibn Jarir
	and Tabarani have related an incident from Hadrat Abu Hurairah, who
	savs, &quot;One day when 1 returned home after offering the 'lsha
	prayer in the Prophet's Mosque, I saw a woman standing at my door. I
	saluted her and walked into my room, closed the door and busied
	myself in voluntary worship. After a while she knocked at the door.
	I opened the door and asked what she wanted. She said that she had
	come with a problem: She had committed zina, had become pregnant,
	given birth to a child and then killed it. She wanted to know if
	there was any chance of her sin being forgiven. I replied in the
	negative. She went back grief-stricken, exclaiming, &quot;Ah! this
	beautiful body was created for the fire!&quot; The next morning,
	after the prayer, when I related the night's incident before the
	Holy Prophet, he said, &quot;You gave a very wrong answer, Abu
	Hurairah: Haven't you read the Qur'anic verse which says: '(Those)
	who do not invoke any other deity than Allah...except the one who
	may have repented (after those sins) and have believed and done
	righteous deeds' `?&quot; Hearing this from the Holy Prophet, I went
	out in search of the woman, and had her traced again at the `Isha
	time. I gave her the good news and told her what the Holy Prophet
	had said in reply to her question. She immediately tell prostrate on
	the ground and thanked Allah, Who had opened a way for her
	forgiveness. Then she offered repentance and set a slave-girl, along
	with her son, tree.&quot; A similar incident about an old man has
	been related in the traditions. He came before the Holy Prophet and
	said, &quot;O Messenger of Allah, all my life has passed in sin:
	there is no sin which I have not committed; so much so that if my
	sins were to be distributed over the people of the whole world, they
	would all be doomed. Is there any way out for my forgiveness?&quot;
	The Holy Prophet asked him, &quot;Have you embraced Islam?&quot; He
	said, &quot;I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and that
	Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.&quot; The Holy Prophet said, &quot;Go
	back, Allah is All-Forgiving and has the power to change your evil
	deeds into good deeds.&quot; He asked,&quot;Is it about all my
	crimes and errors?'' The Holy Prophet replied, &quot;Yes, it is
	about all your crimes and errors.&quot; ( Ibn Kathir) .

	a new life of belief and obedience to Allah and by His grace and
	help will start doing good deeds instead of evil deeds that he used
	to do in his life of unbelief, and his evil deeds will be replaced
