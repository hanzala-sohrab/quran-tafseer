<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">which have been reported by Aswad bin
Yazid, Abu Ishaq and Zubair bin Mu'awiyah from Hadrat Ibn Mas'ud,
indicate that this is the first Surah of the Qur'an, which the Holy
Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had publicly
recited before an assembly of the Quraish (and according to Ibn
Marduyah, in the Ka'bah) in which both the believers and the
disbelievers were present. At the end, when he recited the verse
requiring the performance of a </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">sajdah</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

whole assembly also fall down in prostration with him, and even those
chiefs of the polytheists who were in the forefront of the opposition
to the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) could
not resist falling down in prostration. Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be
pleased with him) says that he saw only one man, Umayyah bin Khalaf,
from among the disbelievers, who did not fall down in prostration but
took a little dust and rubbing it on his forehead said that that was
enough for him. Later, as Ibn Mas'ud relates, he saw this man die in
the state of disbelief. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

eye witness of this incident is Hadrat Muttalib bin Abi Wada'ah, who
had not yet become a Muslim. Nasai and Musnad Ahmad contain his own

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ibn
Sad says that before this, in the Rajab of the 5th year of
Prophethood, a small group of the Companions had emigrated to
Abyssinia. Then, when in the Ramadan of the same year this incident
took place the news spread that the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him) had recited Surah An-Najm publicly in the
assembly of the Quraish and the whole assembly, including the
believers as well as the disbelievers, had fallen down in prostration
with him. When the emigrants to Abyssinia heard this news they formed
the impression that the disbelievers of Makkah had become Muslims.
Thereupon, some of them returned to Makkah in the Shawwal of the 5th
year of Prophethood, only to learn that the news was wrong and the
conflict between Islam and disbelief was raging as furiously as
before. Consequently, the second emigration to Abyssinia took place,
in which many more people left Makkah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thus,
it becomes almost certain that this Surah was revealed in the Ramadan
of 5th year of Prophethood. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
details of the period of revelation as given above point to the
conditions in which this Surah was revealed. During the first five
years of his appointment as a Prophet, the Holy Prophet (peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him) had been extending invitation to
Allah's Religion by presenting the Divine Revelations before the
people only in private and restricted meetings and assemblies. During
this whole period he could never have a chance to recite the Quran
before a common gathering openly, mainly because of the strong
opposition and resistance from the disbelievers. They were well aware
of how magnetic and captivating was the Holy Prophet's personality
and his way of preaching and how impressive were the Revelations of
the Qur'an. Therefore, they tried their best to avoid hearing it
them- selves and to stop others also from hearing it and to suppress
his invitation by false propaganda by spreading every kind of
suspicion against him. For this object, on the one hand, they were
telling the people that Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him) had gone astray and was now bent upon misleading others as
well; on the other hand, they would raise on uproar whenever he tried
to present the Qur'an before the people so that no one could know
what it was for which he was being branded as a misled and misguided
person. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Such
were the conditions when the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him) suddenly stood up one day to make a speech in the
sacred precincts of the Ka'bah, where a large number of the Quraish
had gathered together. Allah at that time made him deliver this
discourse, which we have now in the form of the Surah An-Najm with
us. Such was the intensity of the impression that when the Holy
Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) started reciting
it the opponents were so completely overwhelmed that they could not
think of raising any disorder, and when at the conclusion he fell
down in prostration, they too fell down in prostration along with
him. Later they felt great remorse at the weakness they had
involuntarily shown. The people also started taunting them to the
effect that whereas they had been forbidding others to listen to the
Qur'an, that day not only had they themselves listened to it, with
complete absorption but had even fallen down in prostration along
with Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). At last,
they had to invent a story in order to get rid of the people's taunt
and ridicule. They said &quot;After he had recited </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">afara'ait-ul

we heard from Muhammad the words: </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">tilk

'They are exalted goddesses: indeed, their intercession may be
expected.' From this we understood that Muhammad had returned to our
faith.&quot; As a matter of fact, only a mad person could think that
in the context of this Surah the sentences they claimed to have heard
could have any place and relevance.(For details, please see E. N.'s
96 to 301 of Surah Al Hajj). </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
theme of the discourse is to warn the disbelievers of Makkah about
the error of the attitude that they had adopted towards the Qur'an
and the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
discourse starts in a way as if to say: &quot;Muhammad is neither
deluded nor gone astray, as you are telling others in your propaganda
against him, nor has he fabricated this teaching of Islam and its
message, as you seem to think he has. In fact, whatever he is
presenting is nothing but Revelation which is sent down to him. The
verities that be presents before you, are not the product of his own
surmise and speculation but realities of which he himself is an eye
witness. He has himself seen the Angel through whom this knowledge is
conveyed to him. He has been directly made to observe the great Signs
of his Lord: whatever he says is not what he has himself thought out
but what he has seen with his own eyes. Therefore, your disputing and
wrangling with him is just like the disputing and wrangling of a
blind man with a man of sight over a thing which the blind man cannot
see but he can see.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this, three things have been presented in their successive order: </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First,
the listeners have been made to understand that: &quot;The religion
that you are following is based on mere conjecture and invented
ideas. You have set up a few goddesses like Lat and Manat and Uzza as
your deities, whereas they have no share whatever in divinity. You
regard the angels as the daughters of Allah, whereas you regard a
daughter as disgraceful for your own selves. You think that these
deities of fours can influence Allah in your favor, whereas the fact
is that all the angels together, who are stationed closest to Allah,
cannot influence Him even in their own favor. None of such beliefs
that you have adopted, is based on knowledge and reason, but are
wishes and desires for the sake of which you have taken some whims as
realities. This is a grave error. The right and true religion is that
which is in conformity to the reality, and the reality is never
subject to thee people's wishes and desires so that whatever they may
regard as a reality and truth should become the reality and truth.
Speculation and conjecture cannot help to determine as to what is
according to the truth and what is not; it is knowledge. When that
knowledge is presented before you, you turn away from it, and brand
the one who tells you the truth as misguided. The actual cause of
your being involved in this error is that you are heedless of the
Hereafter. Only this world is your goal. Therefore, you have neither
any desire for the knowledge of reality, nor you bother to see
'whether the beliefs you hold are according to the truth or not. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Secondly,
the people have been told that: Allah is the caster and Sovereign of
the entire Universe. The righteous is he who follows His way, and the
misguided he who has turned away from His way. The error of the
misguided and the righteousness of the righteous are not hidden from
Him. He knows whatever everyone is doing: He will requite the evil
with evil and the good with good. The final judgment will not depend
on what you consider yourself to be, and on tall claims you make of
your purity and chastity but on whether you are pious or impious,
righteous or unrighteous, in the sight of God. If you refrain from
major sins, He in His mercy will overlook your minor errors.'' . </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thirdly,
a few basic principles of the true Religion which had been presented
hundreds of years before the revelation of the Qur'an in the Books of
the Prophets Abraham and Moses have been reiterated so that the
people did not remain involved in the misunderstanding that the
Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) had
brought some new and novel religion, but they should know that these
are the fundamental truths which the former Prophets of Allah have
always been presenting in their respective ages. Besides, the same
Books have been quoted to confirm the historical facts that the
destruction of the 'Ad and the Thamud and of the people of the
Prophets Noah and Lot was not the result of accidental calamities,
but Allah has destroyed them in consequence of the same wickedness
and rebellion from which the disbelievers of Makkah were not inclined
to refrain and desist in any case. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
presenting these themes and discourses the Surah has been concluded,
thus: &quot;The Hour of Judgment has approached near at hand, which
no one can avert. Before the occurrence of that Hour you are being
warned through Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him)
and the Quran in the like manner as the former people had been warned
before. Now, is it this warning that you find novel and strange?
Which you mock and ridicule? Which you turn away from and cause
disorder so that no one else also is able to hear what it is ? Don't
you feel like weeping at your folly and ignorance? Abandon this
attitude and behavior, bow down to Allah and serve Him alone!&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
was that impressive conclusion hearing which even the most hardened
deniers of the Truth were completely overwhelmed, and when after
reciting these verses of Divine Word the Holy Messenger of Allah
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) fell down in prostration,
they too could not help falling down in prostration along with him. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	This is meant to make the people of the Quraish realize: &quot;The

	is the thing for which an oath has been sworn by the setting star or
	stars. &quot;Going astray&quot; means a person's adopting a wrong
	way being unaware of the right way, and &quot;being deluded&quot;
	means his adopting the wrong way knowingly and consciously. The
	verse means: &quot;Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
	blessings) is a well-known man among you. Your accusation that he
	has gone astray, or is misguided, is utterly wrong. In fact, he is
	neither gone astray nor misguided.&quot; Here, the propriety of
	swearing by the setting stars is that in the darkness of the starry
	night a person cannot see the things of his surroundings clearly,
	and from their vague appearances can form wrong judgments about
	them, e.g.. he may take a tra for a ghost in the dark, a string for
	a snake, a rock in the sand for a beast of prey. But when the stars
	have set and the day has dawned, everything appears before man in
	its real form and shape, and there remains no doubt whatever about
	the reality of anything. The same is the case also of Muhammad (upon
	whom be Allah's peace and blessings) among you. His life and
	personality is. not hidden in darkness, but is manifest like the
	bright dawn. You are aware that this &quot;companion of yours&quot;
	is a right-minded, wise and sagacious man. How can somebody from
	among the Quraish have the misunderstanding that he has gone astray?
	You also know how well-intentioned and honest and righteous person

	have been sent down, and are being sent down, to him by God. He did
	not intend to become a Prophet of his own desire so that he might
	have laid a claim to Prophet hood in order to satisfy his desire,

	their accountability, the truths that he is presenting about the
	Universe and Man and the principles of leading a pure life, are not
	a philosophy propounded by himself, but the knowledge of all this

	to everything that he spoke, or to sonic of his words and not to
	others? The answer is: As far as the Qur'an is concerned, the Divine

	others to Allah, and for explaining the themes, teachings and
	commands of the Qur'an, or for giving admonition and instruction to
	the people to fulfill the object for which the Qur'an was revealed.
	In this regard, obviously nobody can have the doubt that, God
	forbid, he fabricated these things from his own mind. In these
	matters, his position, in fact, was of the official interpreter of
	the Qur'an and of Allah's authorized representative. Although these
	things were not revealed to him literally as the Qur'an was
	revealed; yet these were necessarily based on the same knowledge
	that he had been given by Revelation. The only difference between
	the Qur'an and these was that the Qur'an, both in word and in
	meaning, was entirely from Allah, and in these other things the
	meanings were those taught by Allah and the words those which he
	himself employed to express those meanings. On the basis of this
	very distinction, the Qur'an has been described as wahi-jali
	(manifest Revelation) and the Holy Prophet's other sayings as
	wahi-khafi (concealed Revelation). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second kind of the words were those which the Holy Prophet spoke in
	connection with the struggle of raising Allah's Word and his
	services for establishing Islam. In this regard, he had to perform
	countless duties of different kinds as the leader and guide of the
	Muslim community. In this many a time he took counsel with his
	Companions as well, and followed their advice instead of his own
	view. On being asked he sometimes told them that he was expressing a
	particular view not under Allah's command but as his personal
	opinion, and on several occasions it so happened that he said
	something on the basis of his own opinion and later. an instruction
	came down against it from Allah. None of the things of this nature
	that he said or did could be based on a selfish motive. As for the
	question whether these sayings were based on Divine inspiration, the
	answer is that except for the things in regard to which he made it
	explicit that they were not based on Divine command, or about which
	he took counsel with his Companions and accepted their advice, or
	with regard to a thing against which Allah sent down an instruction
	after he had said or done something on the basis of his personal
	judgment, all other things were based on concealed Revelation (wahi
	khafi) just like the things of the first kind. For the office of the
	leader and guide of the Islamic Movement and the chief of the
	believing community and the ruler of the Islamic State, which he
	held, was not self-invented or bestowed by the people, but he had
	been appointed to it by Allah, and whatever he said and did in
	carrying out the duties of this office, his position in it was of
	the representative of Divine, Will. In this matter, whatever he said
	on the basis of his personal judgment, his judgment in those matters
	was approved by Allah, and was, derived from the light of the
	knowledge which Allah had blessed him with. That is why whenever his
	personal judgment was even slightly turned away from Allah's
	pleasure, it was immediately rectified by manifest Revelation (wahi
	jali; ). This rectification of some of his personal judgments is
	itself a proof that all the rest of his religious judgments and
	interpretations were precisely in accordance with Divine Will. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	kind of the things were those he said concerning common matters of
	life as a man, which had nothing to do with the duties of Prophet
	hood, which he said before being appointed a Prophet as well as
	continued saying even after having been appointed a Prophet. About
	this kind of the Things it should be understood at the outset that
	there was no dispute with the disbelievers concerning them. They had
	not accused him of being a misled and misguided person because of
	these but because of the first two kinds of the things. These things
	were not disputed and therefore could not become the cause of a
	verse from Allah. But although they were not the subject of any
	dispute, yet the fact is that in this private aspect of his life
	also never did the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) utter a word
	that was opposed to the truth, but at all times, under all
	conditions, his words and deeds remained within the bounds that
	Allah had prescribed for living his life as a Prophet and righteous
	man. Therefore, the light of Revelation shone in that sphere as
	well. This same thing has been reported from the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be peace) in some authentic Ahadith. In Musnad Ahmad a
	Tradition has been related on the authority of Hadrat Abu Hurairah,
	saying that the Holy Prophet once said: &quot;I never say anything
	but what is true and right. &quot; A Companion said, &quot;O
	Messenger of Allah, you say things sometimes in jest also.' The Holy
	Prophet replied: &quot;Indeed, I never say anything but the truth. &quot;
	According to Musnad Ahmad and Abu Da'ud, Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr
	bin 'As is reported to have said: &quot;I used to write down
	whatever I heard from the sacred tongue of the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be peace) so as to preserve it. The people of the Quraish
	forbade me to do this, saying: 'You arc writing down everything
	whereas the Holy Prophet is a man: he sometimes says things in the
	state of anger too'. At this I gave up writing. Afterwards when I
	mentioned this before the Holy Prophet, he said: 'You should
	continue writing: By Him in Whose hand is my life, never have I said
	anything but the truth'.&quot; (For a complete discussion of this
	question, see my book Tafhimat vol. I, Article: Prophethood and Its
	Injunctions). &nbsp;

	is, &quot;There is no human being who teaches him this, as you seem
	to think, but he obtains this knowledge through a supernatural
	source. &quot; According to some people, &quot;mighty in power&quot;
	implies Allah Himself, but a great majority of the commentators are
	agreed that it implies the Angel Gabriel (upon whom be peace). This
	same view has been reported from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Hadrat
	'A'ishah, Hadrat Abu Hurairah, Qatadah, Mujahid and Rabi` bin Anas.
	Ibn Jarir, Ibn Kathir, Razi, Alusi and others also have adopted this
	very view. Shah Waliyullah and Maulana Ashraf 'Ali Thanwi also have
	followed this same view in their translations. And the fact is that
	from the other explanations of the Qur'an itself also this very
	thing is confirmed. In Surah Takvir it has been said: &quot;This
	indeed is the word of a noble Messenger, who has great power and
	high rank with the Owner of the Throne: there he is obeyed and held
	as trustworthy. And (O people of Makkah), your Companion is not mad.
	He has seen that Messenger on the bright horizon.&quot; (vv. 19-23).
	Then, in Surah Al-Baqarah: 97, the Angel has been mentioned by name
	through whom this teaching had been revealed on the heart of the
	Prophet: &quot;Say to them: Whoever is enemy to Gabriel should
	understand that he has, by Allah's Command, revealed to your heart
	the Qur'an.&quot; If these verses are read with this verse of Surah
	An-Najm, there remains no doubt that here &quot;mighty in power&quot;
	implies the Angel Gabriel and not Allah. More about, it to follow. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here,
	some people express the doubt as to how the Angel Gabriel can be
	regarded as the Holy Prophet Muhammad's teacher. For this would mean
	that he was the teacher and the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	his pupil, and this would place him above the Holy Prophet in rank.
	But this suspicion is misplaced, because Gabriel did not impart
	instruction to the Holy Prophet from any personal knowledge of his
	own, which might give him superiority over the Holy Prophet. Allah,
	in fact, had made him a means of conveying knowledge to the Holy
	Prophet, and he was the Holy Prophet's teacher in the metaphoric
	sense for being only a medium of instruction. That does not give him
	any superiority whatever. To quote an example: After the Prayer was
	prescribed five times a day, Allah sent Gabriel (peace be upon him)
	to teach the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) the correct times of
	the Prayers, and he led him in the Prayers five times daily for two
	days. This has been related in Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi
	and Mu'watta and other collections of the Ahadith, with authentic
	chains of reporters, and in this the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) himself has explained that he was the follower and Gabriel
	his leader in the Prayers. But his being made the leader only for
	the purpose of instruction does not mean that he was superior to the
	Holy Prophet in rank.

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to the first translation, the meaning would be: Gabriel revealed to
	the servant of Allah whatever he had to reveal&quot;; according to
	the second: &quot;Allah revealed through Gabriel to His servant
	whatever He had to reveal. &quot; The commentators have given both
	these meanings; the first meaning, however, fits in better with the
	context, .and the same has been reported from Hadrat Hasan Basri and
	lbn Zaid. Here, the question may be asked: &quot;How can the pronoun
	of abd-i-hi turn to Allah instead of to the subject of auha, whereas
	Allah has nowhere been mentioned from the beginning of the Surah to
	this place ?&quot; The answer is that wherever it becomes apparent
	from the context that the antecedent of a pronoun refers to a
	particular person, the pronoun turns to him automatically whether it
	has been mentioned before or not. There are several instances of
	this available in the Qur'an itself. In Surah Al-Qadr: l, Allah
	says: &quot;We have sent it down in the Night of Glory.&quot; There
	is no mention of the Qur'an in this sentence, but the context
	explicitly shows that the antecedent of the pronoun is the Qur'an.
	At another place Allah says: &brvbar;If Allah were to seize the
	people because of their misdeeds, He would not leave any creature
	(unpunished) on its back. &quot; In this sentence there is no
	mention of the earth anywhere, but the context clearly shows that
	&quot;its back&quot; implies &quot;the earth's back&quot;. In Surah
	Ya Sin: 69, it has been said: &quot;We have not taught him poetry,
	nor does poetry behoove him.&quot; Here, there is no mention of the
	Holy Prophet, neither before this sentence nor after it, yet the
	context is explicit that the antecedent of the pronouns is the Holy
	Prophet himself. In Surah Ar-Rahman: 26, it has been said: &quot;Whatever
	exists on it shall perish.&quot; There is no mention of the earth
	either before or after it, but the style clearly shows that the
	pronoun of 'alaika turns to it. In Surah AI-Waqi'ah: 35, it has been
	said: &quot;We shall have created them especially.&quot; There is no
	noun or pronoun before or after it to which the pronoun of hunna may
	be referring. It is apparent from the context that it signifies the
	women of Paradise. Thus, as auha ila `abd-i hi cannot at all mean
	that Gabriel revealed to his servant, the meaning necessarily would
	be that &quot;Gabriel revealed w the servant of Allah&quot;, or that
	&quot;Allah revealed to His own servant through Gabriel. &quot; &nbsp;

	is, &quot;As the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be peace) observed
	all this in broad daylight in the waking condition, with open eyes,
	his heart did not deem it was a delusion, or that it was a jinn or a
	devil, who had appeared before him, or that it was an imaginary
	figure, or a vision that he was seeing while awake, but his heart
	fully confirmed what his eyes saw. He did not for a moment doubt
	that it was the Angel Gabriel and the Message he was conveying was
	indeed God's Revelation to him.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, the
	question arises: How is it that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) did not entertain any doubt at all concerning such a
	wonderful and extraordinary observation, and he confirmed with full
	faith that whatever his eyes saw was an actual fact and not an
	imaginary figure, nor a jinn or devil ? When we consider this
	question deeply we are led to five reasons for it: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that the external conditions in which this observation was made,
	testified to its truth and validity. The Holy Prophet did not
	observe this in darkness, or in a state of meditation, or in a
	vision, or in a sleep-like condition, but the day had dawned and he
	was fully awake, and he was seeing the whole scene in the broad
	daylight in the open with his own eyes precisely in the way as one
	sees the other things in the world. If doubt is cast on this, then
	whatever we see in the day time, e.g. rivers, mountains, men,
	houses, etc., also would become doubtful and illusory. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second,
	that the Holy Prophet's own internal condition also testified to its
	validity. He was in his full senses. He had no idea whatever in his
	mind that he should observe, or that he was going to observe, such a
	thing. His mind was absolutely free from such a thought and any
	longing for it, and in this state he met with this experience
	suddenly. There was no room for doubting that the eyes were seeing
	an actual scene, but that an imaginary thing had appeared before his
	eyes. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Third,
	that the being who had appeared before him in that condition was so
	marvelous and magnificent, so beautiful and bright, that neither had
	he ever had any concept of such a being before that he could take it
	for a product of his own imagination, nor could a jinn or a devil
	have such an appearance that he would have taken him for a being
	other than an angel. Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud has reported that
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: &ldquo;I saw Gabriel in
	the shape that he had six hundred wings.&rdquo; (Musnad Ahmad), In
	another Tradition Ibn Mas`ud has further explained that each single
	wing of Gabriel (on whom be peace) was so extensive that it seemed
	to be covering the whole horizon (Musnad Ahmad), Allah Himself has
	described him as shadid al-quwa (one mighty in power) and dhu-mirra
	(one endowed with great wisdom). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Fourth,
	that the teaching that the being was imparting also testified to the
	validity of the observation. The Holy Prophet had no concept of the
	knowledge that he received suddenly through him, a knowledge that
	comprehended the realities and truths of the whole Universe. About
	it he could not have the doubt that it consisted of his own ideas
	which were being set and arranged by his own mind. Likewise, there
	was no ground for thinking either that it was Satan who was
	imparting that knowledge to him and thus deluding him, for it is not
	for Satan that he should teach, nor can he ever teach, the doctrine
	of Tauhid to man as against polytheism and idol-worship, that he
	should warn of the accountability of the Hereafter, that he should
	create contempt against ignorance and its practices, that he should
	invite people to moral excellences, and should exhort a person not
	only to accept that teaching himself but should also rise to
	eradicate polytheism, injustice, wickedness and sin from the world
	and replace these evils by the virtues of Tauhid, justice, equity
	and piety. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The fifth
	and by far the most important reason is that when Allah chooses a
	certain person for His Prophet hood, He cleanses his heart of doubts
	and suspicions and evil suggestions and fills it with faith and
	conviction. In this state no hesitation or vacillation is caused in
	his mind about the validity of whatever his eyes see and his ears
	hear. He accepts with complete satisfaction of the heart every truth
	that is revealed to him by his Lord, whether it is in the form of an
	observation that he is made to witness with the eyes, or in the form
	of knowledge which he is inspired with, or in the form of a
	Revelation that is recited to him literally. In all these cases the
	Prophet is fully aware that he is absolutely safe and secure against
	Satanic interference of every kind, and whatever he is receiving in
	any form is precisely and definitely from his Lord. Like all
	God-given feelings this sense and feeling of the Prophet also is a
	certainty which does not admit of any misunderstanding. Just as the
	fish has a God-given sense of being a swimmer, the bird of being a
	bird, and the man of being a man, and there can be no likelihood of
	any misunderstanding in this regard, so has the Prophet also a God
	given sense of his being a Prophet. He does not even for a moment
	entertain the doubt that he has perhaps been involved in the
	misunderstanding of being a Prophet.

	given by Ibn Jarir in his commentary, and by Ibn kathir in

	the sight of Allah.

	Jannat which the believers and righteous will be given in the
	Hereafter, and from this same verse he has argued that that Jannat

	verse clearly starts that the Holy Prophet had not seen Allah but
	His wonderful Sings. Even according to the context, this second
	meeting also took place with the same being with whom the first
	meeting had taken place. Therefore, one will have to admit that
	neither the one whom he had first seen on the uppermost horizon was
	Allah nor he whom he saw afterwards by the farthest lote-tree was
	Allah. Had he seen Allah Almighty on either occasion it would have
	been a great thing and must certainly have been mentioned here

	of these reasons apparently there was no ground for the dispute
	whether the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) on both these
	occasions had seen Allah Almighty or the Angel Gabriel (on whom be

	the traditions of Hadith differ on this question. Below we reproduce
	in their sequence the Ahadith that have been reported from the

	Traditions of Hadrat `A'ishah: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Masruq has stated in Kitab at-Tafsir of Bukhari asked Hadrat
	'A'ishah: O mother of the faithful! Had Muhammad (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) seen his Lord and Sustainer? She replied: Your
	question has terrified me. Why do you forget that if a person lays
	claim to three of the things, he would lay a false claim? (The first
	of these things that Hadrat `A'ishah mentioned was): Whoever among
	you says that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) had seen his
	Lord and Sustainer, tells a lie. Then Hadrat `A'ishah recited these
	verses: La tudriku-hul-absar &quot;Eyes cannot comprehend Him; &quot;
	and: Ma kana li-bashar-in anyyukallima-hullah-u ills wahy-an au
	min-wara-i-hijab- in au yursila rasul an fayu-hia bi-idhni hi ma
	yasha-u: &quot;It is not given to any mortal that Allah should speak
	to him, face to face; He, speaks either through Revelation (secret
	instruction), or from behind a curtain, or He sends a messenger (an
	angel), who by Allah's Command, reveals whatever He wills.&quot;
	(Ash-Shura: 51). Then she said: &brvbar;The Holy Prophet (upon whom
	be peace) in fact had seen Gabriel (on whom be peace) in his real
	shape twice.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A part of
	this Hadith is also found in Bukhari (chapter 4 of Kitab atTauhid)
	And in the tradition that Bukhari has cited from Masruq in Kitab
	Bida 'aI-Khalq, he states: &quot;Hearing this thing from Hadrat
	`A'ishah, I asked: What would then Allah's words, Thumma dana
	fa-tadalla, fa-Kana qaba qausain-i au adha. mean ? She replied: This
	refers to Gabriel; he always appeared before the Holy Prophet in
	human shape, but on this occasion he had appeared before him in his
	real shape and nature and the whole horizon was filled with him. &quot;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In Muslim
	(Kitab al-Iman, Babu fi Dhikr Sidrat al-muntaha) this conversation
	between Hadrat `A'ishah and Masruq has been related in greater
	detail, its most important part being this: &quot;Hadrat `A'ishah
	said: The one who claims that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace
	and blessings) had seen his Lord and Sustainer imputes a lie to
	Allah. Masruq says: I was leaning back. Hearing this I sat up and
	said: Mother of the faithful, do not make haste: Has not Allah said:
	wa lagad ra'a-hu bi/-ufuq-i/ mubin? and lagad ra'a-hu nazlat-an
	ukhra '' Hadrat 'A'ishah replied: I was the first one in this Ummah
	who inquired of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) about this. He
	had replied: &quot;It was Gabriel (on whom be peace). I have never
	seen him in his real shape and form in which Allah has created him
	except on these two occasions. On these two occasions I saw him
	descending from the heavens and his great presence was covering the
	whole space between the earth and the heavens.&quot;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Ibn
	Marduyah has related this tradition of Masruq, thus: &quot;Hadrat

	had only seen Gabriel descending from the heavens.&quot;

	Lord?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied: Nur-un anna ara-hu; and in the
	other he says that the Holy Prophet gave this answer to his
	question: Ra 'aitu nur-an. Of the first answer of the Holy Prophet
	Ibn al-Qayyim has given this meaning in his Zad al-Ma ad: &quot;Between

	(upon whom be peace). He spoke to Moses twice, and Muhammad saw Him

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(8) A
	tradition of Hadrat Anas bin Malik which Imam Bukhari has cited in
	his Kitab at-Tauhid in connection with the event of the Mi'raj, on
	the authority of Sharik bin `Abdullah, contains words to the effect:
	&quot;When the Holy Prophet reached sidrat al-muntaha, Allah
	Almighty drew near him and hung suspended above him till there
	remained between the Holy Prophet and Him a distance equal to two
	bow-lengths or even Iess. Then, what Allah revealed to him included
	the Command for SO Prayers.&quot; But, besides the objections that
	Imam Khattabi, Hafiz lbn Hajar, Ibn Hazm and Hafiz `Abdul Haq
	(author of Al-Jam' bain al-Sahihain) have raised in respect of the
	authenticity and subject-matter of this tradition, the main
	objection against it is that it clearly contradicts the Qur'an, for
	the Qur'an mentions two separate occasions when the experience of
	the vision took place, the first initially at the uppermost horizon
	to which reference has been made in: Dane fa-tadalla, fa-kana qaba
	qausain-i au adna, and a second time near sidrat al muntaha. But
	this tradition mixes up the two occasions and presents them both as
	one occasion of the vision. Therefore, because of its being
	contradictory to the Qur'an, it cannot be acceptable in any case. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the other traditions that we have cited above, the weightiest among
	them are those that have been related from Hadrat `Abdullah bin
	Mas'ud and Hadrat `A'ishah, for both of them have unanimously
	reported this saying of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	himself that on neither occasion he had seen Allah but Gabriel
	(peace be on him), and these traditions fully conform to the
	explanations and allusions of the Qur'an. Furthermore, they are also
	confirmed by the sayings of the Holy Prophet which Hadrat Abu Dharr
	and Hadrat Abu Musa al-Ash'ari have reported from him. On the
	contrary the traditions that have been cited from Hadrat 'Abdullah
	bin `Abbas in the books of Hadith are self-contradictory. In some he
	regards both the experiences as a vision with the eyes, in some both
	as a vision with the heart, in some one with the eyes and the other
	with the heart, and in some he wholly negates the vision with the
	eyes. In none of these traditions he has cited any saying of the
	Holy Prophet himself and where he has cited such a saying, it
	contains no mention of either of the two experiences stated in the
	Qur'an; besides, the explanation of one of his traditions givcn by
	the other indicates that the Holy Prophet at some time bad seen
	Allah Almighty not in the waking condition but in a vision during
	sleep. Therefore, in fact, for the commentary of these verses the
	traditions ascribed to Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas cannot be held as
	reliable. Likewise, although the traditions of Muhammad bin Ka'b
	al-Qurzi cite a saying of the Holy Prophet, they do not mention the
	names of the Companions who might have heard this thing from the
	Holy Prophet himself. Moreover, in one of them it has been said that
	the Holy Prophet had clearly denied having seen Allah with the eyes.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote15sym" HREF="#sdfootnote15anc">15</A>That
	is, &quot;You regard the teachings being given to you by Muhammad
	(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) as erroneous and
	falsehood, whereas he is being given this knowledge by Allah, and
	Allah has made him see with his own eyes the verities to which he is
	testifying before you. Now consider it for yourself as to how
	irrational are the beliefs that you are following persistently and''
	as to whom you arc causing loss by opposing and resisting the person
	who is guiding you to the Right Way. In this connection, especially
	the three goddesses that were worshiped generally by the people of
	Makkah, Ta'if and other parts of Hejaz have been taken as an
	example. About them, they have been asked: Have you ever considered
	rationally whether they could have even the slightest role in the
	affairs of the Godhead of the earth and heavens? Or could they bear
	any relationship whatever with the Lord of the Universe? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	shrine of Lat was in Ta'if and the Bani Thaqif were so devoted to it
	that when Abraha was advancing to Makkah with his army of elephants
	to destroy the Ka'bah, the people only in order to save the temple
	of their deity had provided the wicked man with guides to lead him w
	Makkah so that he should spare Lat, whereas like all the Arabs the
	people of Thaqif also believed that the Ka'bah is Allah's House.
	Scholars have disputed the meaning of Lat. According to Ibn Jarir
	Tabari, it is the feminine gender of Allah, i.e. originally this
	word was allahatun which became al-Lat. According to Zamakhshari, it
	is derived from hva yalvi, . which means to turn to or bow to
	somebody. As the polytheists turned to it for worship and bowed to
	it and circumambulated it, it began to be called Lat. Ibn 'Abbas
	reads it as left (with a stress on t) and holds it is derived from
	latt yalittu, which means to churn and mix together. He and Mujahid
	state that this, in fact, was a man, who lived on a rock near Ta'if,
	and used to entertain the pilgrims to Makkah with barley drinks and
	food. When he died the people built a shrine to him on the same rock
	and began to worship him. But this explanation of Lat, in spite of
	having been reported on the authority of scholars like Ibn 'Abbas
	and Mujahid, is not acceptable for two reasons. First, that in the
	Qur'an it has been called Lat and not Latt; second, that the Qur'an
	describes all the three as goddesses, and according to this
	tradition Lat was a man, not a woman.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">'Uzza is
	derived from 'izzat, and it means the one (female) enjoying
	veneration and respect. This was the special goddess of the Quraish
	and her shrine was situated at Hurad in the valley of Nakhlah,
	between Makkah and Ta'if. (For the location of Nakhlah, see E.N. 33
	of Surah AL-Ahqaf). The people of Bani Shaiban, who were the allies
	of the Bani Hashim, were its attendants. The Quraish and the people
	of other tribes paid visits to it and presented offerings and made
	sacrifices to it. As for the Ka`bah sacrificial animals were driven
	to it also and it was held in the highest esteem. Ibn Hisham relates
	that when Abu Uhaihah was on the point of death, Abu Lahab paid him
	a visit and found him weeping. Abu Lahab asked, &brvbar;Why do you
	weep, Abu Uhaihah ? Are you afraid of death ?-and death is the
	destiny of everybody !&quot; He said, `By God, I do not weep because
	of the fear of death, but I am grieved to think as to how 'Uzza will
	be worshipped after me. &quot; Abu Lahab said, &quot;It was neither
	worshipped for your sake in your lifetime, nor will it be given up
	after you have left the world.&quot; Abu Uhaihah said, 'Now I am

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On the

	that a person should practically reach very near a grave sin but
	-should desist from actually committing it. Still others take it in
	the sense of a person's remaining involved in a sin temporarily and
	then desisting from it. And according to some it implies that a

	then alter embracing Islam they refrained from them.'

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	view of Ibn `Abbas is, and the same is also the view of Hadrat Abu
	Hurairah, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin 'As, Mujahid, Hasan Basri
	and Abu Salih, that it implies a person's being involved in a grave
	sin or indecency temporarily, or occasionally, and then giving it
	up. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Masruq and Sha'bi say, and the same also has
	been reported from Hadrat Abu Hurairah and Hadrat 'Abdullah bin
	`Abbas in authentic traditions, that this implies a person's
	approaching the very point of a grave sin and crossing all its
	preliminaries but then restraining himself at the final stage, e.g.
	a person goes out with the intention of stealing but refrains from
	it in the end, or has close association with other women, but
	refrains from committing adultery. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat

	Hereafter.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Said bin

	mind but restraining oneself from committing it practically . 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These arc
	the different explanations which have been reported in the
	traditions from the Companions and their immediate followers. The
	majority of the later commentators and doctors of law and jurists
	arc of the opinion that this verse and verse 31 of Surah An-Nisa
	classify sins into two main kinds: the major sins and the minor
	sins, and these two verses give man the hope that if he abstains
	from the major sins and open indecencies, Allah will overlook his
	minor errors. Although some distinguished scholars have also opined
	that no sin is minor and the disobedience of Allah is by itself a
	major sin, yet as stated by Imam Ghazali the distinction between the
	major and the minor sins is something which cannot be denied, for
	the sources of knowledge of the Shari'ah values and injunctions all
	point to this. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the question, what is the distinction between the major and the
	minor sins, and what kinds of sins are major and what kinds of them
	minor? we are satisfied that: &quot;Every such act is a major sin
	which has been forbidden by a clear ordinance of the Divine Book and
	the Shari'ah of the Prophet, or for which Allah and His Messenger
	have prescribed a punishment in the world, or have held out a threat
	of punishment in the Hereafter, or have cursed the one guilty of
	committing it, or given the news of infliction of punishment on
	those guilty of committing it. &quot; Apart from this class of sins
	all other acts which are disapproved by the Shari'ah, come under the
	definition of minor sins. Likewise, the mere desire for a major sin,
	or an intention to commit it, also is not a major sin but a minor
	sin; so much so that even crossing all the preliminaries of a major
	sin does not constitute a major sin unless one has actually
	committed it. However, even a minor sin becomes a major sin in case
	it is committed with a feeling of contempt for religion and of
	arrogance against Allah, and the one guilty of it does not consider
	the Shari`ah that has declared it an evil worthy of any attention
	and reverence.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote38sym" HREF="#sdfootnote38anc">38</A>From

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	the fruit of one man's deeds cannot be given to another unless he
	has a share in that deed, and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) that
	none can attain anything without striving for it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people wrongly apply these three principles to the economic problems
	of the world and conclude that no person can become the lawful owner
	of anything except of his own earned income. But this conclusion
	clashes with several laws and injunctions given by the Qur'an
	itself, e.g. the law of inheritance, according to which many
	individuals inherit a person and are regarded as his lawful heirs,
	whereas the heritage is not their earned income. As for a suckling
	for instance, it cannot be proved by any stretch of imagination that
	its labor had any share in the wealth left by its father. Likewise,
	there arc the injunctions about the zakat and voluntary charities
	according to which the wealth of one man is transferred to others
	only on the basis of their legal and moral entitlement and they
	become its lawful owners, whereas in the production of this wealth
	they did not make any contribution at all. Thus, it is against the
	intention of the Qur'an to take a verse of it and derive from it
	such conclusions as clash with the other teachings of the Qur'an
	itself. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	other people regard these principles as concerning the Hereafter and
	raise the question whether, according to these principles, the deeds
	of one man can in some way be also beneficial for the other person,
	and whether the deeds of a person which he does for another person,
	or on his behalf, can be accepted from him, and whether it is also
	possible that a person may transfer the reward of his act to
	another. If the answer to these questions be in the negative the
	sending of spiritual rewards (isal thawab) for the dead and
	performing Hajj on behalf of another, would be inadmissible; even
	the prayer of forgiveness for the other person would be meaningless,
	for this prayer also is not the concerned person's own act and deed.
	However, this extreme point of view has been adopted by none among
	the followers of Islam except the Mu`tazilites. Only they take this
	verse in the meaning that one man's acts and deeds can in no case be
	beneficial for the other. On the contrary, the followers of the
	Sunnah are unanimous that the prayer of one man is beneficial for
	the other because it is confirmed by the Qur'an; however, they
	differ only in details, and not in principles, as to whether the
	sending of spiritual rewards for another and doing a good work on
	behalf of another is beneficial or not. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	tern isal thawab means that after a person has performed a good act,
	he may pray to Allah to grant its rewards to another. In this
	regard, Imam Malik and Imam Shafe'i have expressed the opinion that
	the rewards of the pure bodily acts of worship, e.g, the Prayer, the
	Fasting and recitals of the Qur'an, etc. cannot reach the other
	person; however, the rewards of one's monetary acts of worship, e.g.
	charities, or Hajj, which is a combination of the monetary and
	bodily worships, can reach the other, for the principle is that one
	man's act should not be beneficial for the other. But since
	according to authentic Ahadith the rewards of charities can be
	conveyed and Hajj on behalf of another also can be performed, they
	admit the permissibility of conveying of rewards to the extent of
	this kind of the acts of worship only. On the contrary, the Hanafi
	viewpoint is that a man can send the reward of each of his virtuous
	acts as a gift to the other, whether it is the Prayer, or the Fast,
	or the recitation of the Qur'an, or remembrance of Allah, or
	charity, or Hajj and `Umrah. The argument is that just as a man
	after carrying out a piece of work can tell the master to pay the
	wages to such and such other person instead of him, so after
	performing a good deed also he can pray to Allah to grant its
	rewards to such and such other person instead of him. In this there
	is no rational ground for making exception of some kinds of virtues
	and keeping it restricted to some other kinds of virtues. The same
	is confirmed by a large number of the traditions:

	in Bukhari, Muslim. Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Majah, Tabari (in Awsat,

	chance to speak, she would have asked me giving away something in
	charity. Now, if I give away something in charity on her behalf,
	will she get a reward for it ?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;Yes,

	preIslamic days of ignorance to sacrifice 100 camels. His uncle,
	Hisham bin 'As, sacrificed fifty camels of his own share. Hadrat
	'Amr bin 'As, asked the Holy Prophet as to what he should do. The
	Holy Prophet replied: &quot;If your father had affirmed faith in the
	Oneness of God, you may observe fasts on his behalf. or give
	something in charity: this would be beneficial for him.&quot;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A
	Tradition has been reported in Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i and

	that Hadrat Sa'd bin 'Ubadah asked the Holy Prophet: &quot;My mother
	has died. Should I give something in charity on her behalf?&quot;
	The Holy Prophet replied in the affirmative. Several other
	traditions bearing on the same subject also have been related in
	Bukhari, Muslim, Musnad Ahmad, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ud, Ibn
	Majah, etc. on the authority of Hadrat 'A'ishah, Hadrat Abu Hurairah
	and Hadrat Ibn 'Abbas, According to which the Holy Prophet permitted
	giving away of something in charity on behalf of the deceased person
	describing it as beneficial for him. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to Daraqutni a person said to the Holy Prophet: ''I have been
	serving my parents while they were alive; what should I do now when
	they are dead?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied; &quot;This would also
	be their service if you offered the Prayer on their behalf along
	with your own Prayers, and observed the Fast on their behalf along
	with your own Fast.&quot; Another tradition in Daraqutni has been
	related from Hadrat `Ali according to which the Holy Prophet said:
	&quot;If a person passing by the graveyard recites &quot;Qul
	huwallah-u ahad&quot; eleven times and gives away its reward for the
	dead, all the dead ones will be granted their due shares of the
	rewards. &quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	large number of the traditions which support one another explicitly
	state that the transfer of the spiritual rewards is not only
	possible but rewards of all kinds of acts of worship and virtuous
	deeds can be sent and conveyed and in it there is no specification
	of any particular kind of acts and deeds. In this connection,
	however, four things should be understood well: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that the reward of that act only can be transferred, which may have
	been performed purely for the sake of Allah and according to the
	Shari'ah injunctions; otherwise obviously an act which is performed
	for the sake of another than Allah, or in contravention of the Shari
	'ah injunctions, cannot even entitle its doer himself to any reward,
	nothing to say of its transfer to another person. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	the gift of the rewards will certainly reach those righteous persons
	who are staying as guests with Allah, but no rewards are expected to
	reach those culprits who are placed in confinement there. The gift
	can reach the guests of Allah but the criminals of Allah cannot be
	expected to receive it. If a person sends his rewards to him because
	of a misunderstanding, it will not go waste but instead of reaching
	the culprit it will return to the actual worker himself just like
	the money-order which returns to the sender in case it does not
	reach the one to whom it has been sent. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly,
	the transfer of the reward is possible but not the transfer of
	punishment. That is, it is possible that one may do a good deed and
	may willingly transfer its reward to the other and it reaches him,
	but it is not possible that one may commit a sin and transfer its
	punishment to the other and it reaches him, 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	fourth thing is that a virtuous act s beneficial in two ways: First,
	on account of its those results which accrue to the soul and
	morality of the doer himself because of which he becomes worthy of a
	reward in the sight of Allah; second, on account of the reward which
	Allah grants him as a gift and favor. The transfer of the spiritual
	reward does not concern the first but only the second. This can be
	understood by an example. A person tries to attain proficiency in
	the art of wrestling by constant practice. The strength and skill
	thus gained is in any way specially meant for his own self; it
	cannot be transferred to another. Similarly, if he is attached to a
	royal court, and there is a stipend fixed for him as a wrestler, he
	alone will receive it and no one else. However, in respect of the
	prizes and gifts that his patron may like to grant him as an
	appreciation for his creditable performance, he may request that
	they may be given to his coach, or parents, or some other
	benefactor, on his behalf. The same is the case with the virtuous
	deeds: their spiritual benefits are not transferable and their
	rewards also cannot be transferred to another, but as for their
	rewards and gifts he can pray to Allah that these may be granted to
	a near and dear one, or a benefactor of his. That is why it is
	termed as isal thawab (conveying of spiritual rewards) and not as
	isal jaza' (conveying of material reward). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Another form of a person's work being beneficial for another is that
	one should either do a virtuous deed on the desire or beckoning of
	another, or without his desire or beckoning, on his behalf, which,
	in fact, was obligatory for him to carry out, but which he was
	unable to carry out himself. In this regard, the Hanafi jurists say
	that the acts of worship are of three kinds: purely physical, e.g.
	the Prayer; purely monetary, e.g. the zakat; and the compound acts
	of bodily and monetary worship, e.g. Hajj. As for the first kind,
	nobody can act as an agent of another. As for the second kind, one
	can act as an agent of the other, e.g. the husband can pay the zakat
	due on the ornaments of the wife. As for the third kind, one can act
	as an agent of the other only in case the actual person on whose
	behalf the act is being performed, is permanently, and not just
	temporarily, unfit to carry out his obligation himself. For example,
	Hajj can be performed on behalf of another only in case the person
	concerned . is unable to go for Hajj himself nor-may have the hope
	that he would ever be able to perform it himself. The Malikis and
	the Shafe is also concur on, this, However, Imam Malik lays down the
	condition that if the father has willed that his son should perform
	Hajj after him, on his behalf, the son can perform Hajj on his
	father's behalf, otherwise not, But the traditions in this regard
	are very explicit. Whether the father has expressed the desire, or
	made a will or not, the son can perform Hajj on his behalf. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Ibn
	'Abbas has related that a woman _from the tribe of Khath'am said to
	the Holy Prophet: &quot;The command for Hajj has reached my father
	at a time when he has become very old: he cannot even sit on the
	camel's back. &quot; The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;You then may
	perform Hajj on his behalf. &quot; (Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad, Tirmidi,
	Nasa'i). A tradition bearing on the same subject has also been
	related by Hadrat 'AIi. (Ahmad, Tirmidhi). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin Zabair has made mention of a tnan of the same tribe of
	Khath'am, who also put a similar question to the Holy Prophet
	concerning his aged father. The Holy Prophet asked: 'Are you his
	eldest son ?&quot; He answered in the affirmative. Thereupon the
	Holy Prophet said &quot;If your father had left behind a debt and
	you paid it off, would it stand paid on his behalf?&quot; He replied
	that it would. The Holy Prophet said: &quot;Then you should likewise
	perform Hajj also on his behalf.&quot; (Ahmad, Nasa'i). Ibn 'Abbas
	relates that a woman from the tribe of Juhainah came to the Holy
	Prophet and said: &quot;My mother had vowed to perform Hajj but she
	died before performing her vow. Now, can I perform Hajj on her
	behalf ?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;If your mother had
	left behind a debt, would you not have paid it? Likewise, you should
	also discharge the vow made to Allah, and Allah has a greater right
	that the vows made to Him be performed.&quot; (Bukhari, Nasa'i).
	Bukhari and Musnad Ahmad contain another tradition to the effect
	that a man came and put the same question to the Holy Prophet
	concerning his sister as has been mentioned above, and the Holy
	Prophet gave him also the same answer. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These
	traditions provide a clear proof that so far as the compound acts of
	bodily and monetary worships are concerned, one can act on behalf of
	another. As for the purely bodily acts of worship, there are some
	Ahadith which prove the permissibility of acting on behalf of
	another in this kind of worship as well. For example, Ibn 'Abbas has
	related that a woman from the tribe of Juhainah asked the Holy
	Prophet: 'My mother had vowed to observe the Fast and she died
	without performing her vow. Now, can I observe the Fast on her
	behalf?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;Observe the Fast on
	her behalf.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad, Abu Da'ud). And Hadrat
	Buraidah's tradition that a woman asked concerning her mother: &quot;She
	had one month's (according to another tradition two months') Fasts
	to observe; can I observe those Fasts on her behalf?&quot; The Holy
	Prophet said that she could.&quot; (Muslim, Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Abu
	Da'ud). And Hadrat 'A'ishah's tradition that the Holy Prophet said:
	&brvbar;If a person dies and he had some Fasts to observe, his
	guardian should observe those Fasts on his behalf.&quot; (Bukhari,
	Muslim, Ahmad). In the tradition related by Bazzar the Holy
	Prophet's words are to the effect: &quot;If his guardian may so
	like, he may observe those Fasts on his behalf). &quot; On the basis
	of these very traditions the Ashab al- Hadith and Imam Auza'i and
	the Zahiris have formed the view that one is permitted to perform
	bodily acts of worship also on behalf of the other. But Imam Abu
	Hanifah, Imam Malik, Shafe'i and Imam Zaid bin 'Ali have given the
	ruling that a fast cannot be observed on behalf of a dead person,
	and Imam Ahmad, Imam Laith and Ishaq bin Rahawaih opine that this
	can be done only in case the deceased person might have so vowed but
	might not have been able to perform his vow. Those who oppose this
	give the argument that the reporters of the Ahadith, which prove its
	permissibility, have themselves given their rulings against it. Ibn
	'Abbas's ruling has been related by Nasa'i, thus: &quot;No one
	should offer a Prayer or observe a Fast on behalf of another.&quot;
	And Hadrat 'A'ishah's ruling, according to 'Abdur Razzaq, is: &quot;Do
	not observe the Fast on behalf of your dead ones; feed (the needy)
	instead.&quot; The same has been related from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin
	'Umar also by 'Abdur Razzaq that the Fast should not be observed on
	behalf of the deceased person. This shows that in the beginning it
	was permissible to perform acts of bodily worship on behalf of
	others, but the practice that became established in the end was that
	it was not permissible to do so; otherwise it was not possible that
	those who have reported these Ahadith from the Holy Prophet, should
	have themselves given rulings against them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, it should be understood well that fulfillment of an
	obligation on behalf of another can be beneficial only to those
	people who have themselves been keen and desirous of fulfilling
	their obligations and might have been unable to do so being rendered
	helpless by circumstances. But a person who deliberately shirked
	going for Hajj although he had the necessary means for it and had no
	feeling whatever of this obligation in his heart either, cannot be
	benefited even if several Hajj be performed on his behalf
	afterwards. This would be analogous to the case of a person who
	deliberately avoided paying his debts and had no intention to pay
	them till the last. Afterwards even if every penny is paid off on
	his behalf, he would remain a debtor in the sight of Allah. The
	payment of the debts by another can relieve only such a person who
	in his lifetime was desirous of paying off his debts but was unable
	to do so due to straitened circumstances.</P>

	Although Imam Malik himself used to perform a sajdah here (as cited
	by Qadi Abu Bakr ibn al-`Arabi in Ahkam al-Qur 'an), yet he held the
	view that it was not obligatory to perform a sajdah here, the basis

	Fajr Prayer and performed a sajdah, then stood up, recited Surah
	al-Zilzal and performed the ruku'. (Sa'id bin Mansur). Imam Malik
