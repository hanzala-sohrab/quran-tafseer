<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Surah consists of two discourses, the first from the beginning of the
Surah to the end of verse 58, and the second from verse 59 to the end
of the Surah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
theme of the first discourse is that only those people can benefit
from the guidance of the Quran and become worthy of the good promises
made in it, who accept the realities which this Book presents as the
basic realities of the universe, and then follow up their belief with
obedience and submission in their practical lives as well. But the
greatest hindrance for man to follow this way is the denial of the
Hereafter. For it makes him irresponsible, selfish and given to
worldly life, which in turn makes it impossible for him to submit
himself before God and to accept the moral restrictions on his lusts
and desires. After this introduction three types of character have
been presented. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
first type is characterized by Pharaoh and the chiefs of Thamud and
the rebels of the people of Lot, who were all heedless of the
accountability of the Hereafter and had consequently become the
slaves of the world. These people did not believe even after seeing
the miracles. Rather they turned against those who invited them to
goodness and piety. They persisted in their evil ways which are held
in abhorrence by every sensible person. They did not heed the
admonition even until a moment before they were overtaken by the
scourge of Allah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
second type of character is of the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon
him), who had been blessed by God with wealth and kingdom and
grandeur to an extent undreamed of by the chiefs of the disbelievers
of Makkah. But, since he regarded himself as answerable before God
and had the feeling that whatever he had was only due to Allah's
bounty, he had adopted the attitude of obedience before Him and there
was no tinge of vanity in his character. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
third type is of the queen of Sheba, who ruled over a most wealthy
and well known people in the history of Arabia. She possessed all
those means of life, which could cause a person to become vain and
conceited. Her wealth and possessions far exceeded the wealth and
possessions of the Quraish. Then she professed </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">shirk</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
which was not only an ancestral way of life with her, but she had to
follow it in order to maintain her position as a ruler. Therefore, it
was much more difficult for her to give up </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">shirk</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

But when the Truth became evident to her, nothing could stop her from
accepting it. Her deviation was, in fact, due to her being born and
brought up in a polytheistic environment and not because of her being
a slave to her lusts and desires. Her conscience was not devoid of
the sense of accountability before God. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">In
the second discourse, at the outset, attention has been drawn to some
of the most glaring and visible realities of the universe, and the
disbelievers of Makkah have been asked one question after the other
to the effect : &quot;Do these realities testify to the creed of
</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">shirk</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">which you are following, or to the
truth of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Tauhid</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">to which the Qur'an invites you?&quot;
After this the real malady of the disbelievers has been pointed out,
saying, &quot;The thing which has blinded them and made them
insensitive to every glaring reality is their denial of the
Hereafter. This same thing has rendered every matter and affair of
life non-serious for them. For, when according to them, everything
has to become dust ultimately, and the whole struggle of life is
purposeless and without an object before it, the truth and falsehood
are equal and alike. Therefore, the question whether one's system of
life is based on the right or wrong foundations, becomes meaningless
for him.&quot; </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">But
the discourse, as outlined above, is not meant to dissuade the
Prophet and the Muslims from calling the obdurate and heedless people
to the way of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Tauhid</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">;
it is, in fact, intended to arouse them from their slumber. That is
why in vv. 67-93 certain things have been said repeatedly in order to
produce in the people a sense of the Hereafter, to warn them of the
consequences of being heedless of it, and to convince them of its
coining, like an eye witness of something, who convinces the other
person of it, who has not seen it. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, the real invitation of the Quran that is, the invitation
to serve One Allah alone, has been presented in a concise but
forceful manner, and the people warned that accepting it would be to
their own advantage and rejecting it to their own disadvantage. For
if they deferred their faith until they saw those Signs of God after
the appearance of which they would be left with no choice but to
believe and submit, they should bear in mind the fact that that would
be the time of judgment and believing then would be of no avail. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	is, &quot;These verses of the Qur'an give guidance and convey the
	good news of a good end only to those people who possess these two
	qualities: (1) They should affirm faith, that is, accept the
	invitation of the Qur'an and the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be
	Allah's peace and blessings), believe In one God as their only Deity
	and Lord, accept the Qur'an' as the Book of Allah, acknowledge the
	Holy Prophet as a true Prophet and their Leader, and also adopt the
	belief that after this life there is another life, in which man has
	to render his full account of deeds and be rewarded or punished
	accordingly. (2) They should not only profess faith verbally, but
	should also be inclined to follow and obey the Divine Commands
	practically, and the first indication of this inclination is that
	they should establish the Salat and pay the Zakat. The verses of the
	Qur'an will show the right way of life only to those people who
	fulfill these two conditions; they will explain to them the
	difference between the right and the wrong at every stage on the
	way, protect them against the wrong ways at every turn of the way,
	and bless them with the satisfaction that whatever be the
	consequences of following the Right Way in the world, in the
	Hereafter they will certainly attain the eternal and everlasting
	success and the good will of Allah only through it. For in order to
	derive full benefit from the teaching of a teacher, one has first to
	have faith in him, then accept to be his student, and then work
	according to his instructions. Similarly, a patient who wants to be
	benefited by a doctor has first to accept him as a physician, and
	then follow his instructions with regard to medical dosage,
	prevention, etc. Then only he can assure the patient of the desired
	results.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people have interpreted the words yu'tun-az-zakat in this verse to
	mean that they should adopt moral purity. But, wherever in the
	Qur'an the word ita-i-zakat has occurred along with the word
	iqamat-i-salat, it means payment of the Zakat, which is the second
	pillar of Islam after the Salat. Moreover, the Qur'an has used the
	word tazakka for adopting piety and purity and not ita' which is
	specifically used for the payment of the Zakat. In fact, what is
	meant to be impressed here is this: In order to benefit fully by the
	guidance of the Qur'an, it is imperative that one should adopt the
	attitude of submission and obedience in practical life as well after
	the affirmation of the Faith, and the establishment of the Salat and
	the payment of the Zakat is the first indication that one has
	actually adopted such an attitude. If there is no such indication,
	it will become obvious that one is rebellious: he might have
	acknowledged a ruler as such, but he is not inclined to carry out
	his commands.</P>

	belief in the Hereafter is an article of the Faith, and a believer
	will also believe in it along with believing in Tauhid and the
	Prophethood, here it has been specially mentioned separately in
	order to bring out its unique importance. The object is to impress
	that for those people who do not believe in the Hereafter, it is
	impossible to follow, even tread, the way taught by the Qur'an. For
	the people of this way of thinking naturally determine their
	criterion of good and evil by the results that appear, in this
	world. For them it is not possible to accept any admonition or
	guidance which seeks to determine the good and evil by the criterion
	of the gain and loss in the Hereafter. Such people in the first
	instance do not at all heed the teachings of the Prophets, but if
	for some reason, they also get included among the believers, they
	find it difficult to take even the initial steps on the way of the
	Faith and Islam because of the lack of faith in the Hereafter. For
	as soon as they will encounter the first situation where the demands
	of the worldly gains and the losses of the Hereafter will pull them
	in opposite directions, they will freely allow themselves to be
	pulled towards the worldly gains without caring in the least for the
	losses of the Hereafter, even though they may be making all sons of

	the existence of any court where his life's work has to be
	scrutinized and judged finally for good and evil, and when he does

	Bible does not either make any mention that there were jinns also in
	the Prophet Solomon's armies, and he took service from them; but the
	Talmud and the rabbinical traditions contain details of this.
	(Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. XI, p. 440). Some of the present-day
	writers have strained every nerve to prove that the words jinn and
	fair do not refer to the jinns and birds but to men who performed
	different duties in the Prophet Solomon's army. They say that the
	Jinn haply the people of the mountain tribes whom Prophet Solomon
	had subdued and who performed teats of great strength and skill
	under him; and fair implies cavalry which could move much faster
	than the infantry. But these are indeed the worst examples of
	misinterpreting the Qur'an. The Qur'an here mentions three distinct
	kinds of the army consisting of the men, the jinns and the birds,
	and all the three gave been qualified by the prefix a1 (alif-lam) to
	denote a class. Therefore, al jinn and al-tair could not be included
	in al-ins (the men), but could be two separate and different classes
	from the men. Moreover, a person who has a little acquaintance with
	Arabic cannot imagine that in this language the mere word a/ Jinn
	could ever imply a group of the men, or al-tair troops mounted on
	horses, nor could any Arab understand these meanings from these
	words. Calling a man a jinn only figuratively because of some
	supernatural feat of his, or a woman a fairy because of her beauty,
	or a fast moving person a bird dces not mean that the words Jinn and
	fairy and bird will henceforth be taken to mean a powerful man and a
	beautiful woman and a fast moving person respectively. These are
	only the metaphoric and not the real meanings of these words. In a
	discourse, a word is used in its figurative instead of its real
	meaning, and the listeners also will take it in that meaning, only
	when there exists in the context a clear pointer to its being
	figurative. What, after all, is the pointer in the context here from
	which one may understand that the words jinn and tair have been used
	not in their real and lexical meaning but in their figurative
	meaning? Contrary to this, the work and the state of a member each
	of the two groups that have been mentioned in the following verses,
	fall entirely against the purport of this interpretation. If a
	person does not want to believe in something stated in the Qur'an,
	he should frankly say that he does not believe in it. But it would
	be moral cowardice and intellectual dishonesty if one should force
	the clear words of the Qur'an to give the meaning that he wants them
	to give, and tell the world that he believes in what the Qur'an
	says, whereas he does not, in fact, believe in it but believes in

	verse also has been greatly misconstrued by some commentators of the
	present day. They say that wad-in naml does not mean &quot;valley of
	the ants&quot;, but it is the name of a valley that was in Syria,
	and namlah does not mean an ant but it is the name of a tribe. Thus,
	according to them, the verse means this: &quot;When the Prophet
	Solomon reached the valley of the ants, a Namilite said, 'O people
	of the Naml tribe ......&quot; But this also is an interpretation
	which is not supported by the words of the Qur'an. Even if we took
	wad-in-naml to be the name of a valley and supposed that it was
	inhabited by the tribe of Bani an-Naml, it would be against the
	Arabic idiom and usage to speak of a member of the tribe as namlah.
	Although there are many Arab tribes which have been named after the
	animals, e.g. Kalb (dog), Asad (lion), etc&quot;., yet no Arab would
	ever say in respect of a member of the Kalb or the Asad tribe: &quot;A
	dog said, or a lion said, etc. Therefore, it would be against the
	Arabic idiom to say in respect of a member of the Naml tribe: &quot;A
	namlah (ant) said this.&quot; Then a member of the Naml tribe's
	warning the people of his tribe, saying, &quot;O Namilites, get into
	your houses lest Solomon's hosts should trample you down without
	even knowing it,&quot; becomes meaningless, It has never happened
	that an army of men should have trampled down a group of men without
	knowing it. If the army has come with the intention of an attack, it
	would be useless for the other side to get into their houses, for in
	that case the invaders would follow them into their houses, and
	trample them more ruthlessly. And if the army is only on the routine
	march, it is just enough to clear off the way for it. Human beings
	may be harmed by the marching columns, but it can never happen that
	the soldiers on the march would trample down other men without
	knowing it. Therefore, if Bani an-Naml were a tribe of human beings,
	and one of its members were to warn his people, then in case of an
	attack, he would have said, &quot;O Namilites, flee your houses and
	take refuge in the mountains lest Solomon's armies should destroy
	you. &quot; And in case there was no danger of an attack, he would
	have said, &quot;O Namilites, clear off the way lest one of you
	should be harmed by the marching columns of Solomon's armies.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	error in the interpretation is on account of the Arabic idiom and
	the subject-matter. As for the name of the valley and the tribe of
	Bani an-Naml inhabiting it, it is a mere hypothesis for which there
	exists no scientific proof. Those who hold that wad-in -naml was the
	name of a valley have themselves pointed out that it had been so
	named because of the abundance of ants in it. Qatadah and Muqatil
	say, &quot;It is a valley in the land of Syria where ants are found
	in abundance. But in no book of history and geography and in no
	archaeological research it is mentioned that it was inhabited by a
	tribe called Bani an-Naml. Thus, it is merely a concoction that has
	been invented to support one's own interpretation.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	story is also found in the Israelite traditions but its latter
	portion falls against the Qur'an as well as against the regal
	dignity of the Prophet Solomon. According to it, when the Prophet
	Solomon was passing through a valley which abounded in ants, he
	heard an ant calling out to the other ants to say, &quot;Get into
	your holes, otherwise you will be trampled down by Solomon's hosts.&quot;
	At this, Prophet Solomon displayed great vanity before the ant to
	which the ant rejoined, &quot; What are you?-the product of a mere
	sperm-drop! &quot; Hearing this the Prophet Solomon felt greatly
	ashamed. (Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. X1, p. 440). This shows how the
	Qur'an corrects the wrong traditions of the Israelites, and cleanses
	the filthy spots with which they had themselves branded the
	characters of their Prophets. It is these traditions about which the

	cavalry, or platoon, or communication department, was missing, whom

	were a well-known commercial people of southern Arabia, whose
	capital city of Ma'rib lay about 55 miles to the north-east of
	San`a', the present capital of Yaman. They rose to power after the
	decline of the Minaean Kingdom in about 1100 B.C. and flourished for
	a thousand years in Arabia. Then in 115 B.C. they were replaced by
	the Himyarites, the other well-known people of southern Arabia, who
	ruled Yaman and Hadramaut in Arabia and Habash in Africa. The
	Sabaeans controlled the whole trade that passed between eastern
	Africa, India, the Far East and Arabia itself, on the one hand, and
	Egypt, Syria, Greece and Rome on the other. That is why they were
	famous for their wealth in the ancient times; so much so that
	according to the Greek historians they were the richest people of
	the world. Besides trade and commerce, another great reason for
	their prosperity was that they had built dams here and there in
	their country to store rainwater for irrigation purposes, which had
	turned their whole land into a veritable garden. The Greek;
	historians have made mention of the unusual greenery of their
	country; and the Qur'an also refers to it in Surah Saba': 15.The
	statement of the hud-hud, `I have obtained knowledge of things of
	which you have no knowledge&quot;, does not imply that the Prophet
	Solomon was wholly unaware of Saba'. Obviously, the ruler of Syria

	Red Sea (Gulf of `Aqabah), could not be unaware of a people who
	ruled the southern shores (Yaman) of the same Red Sea, and who also

	the queen of Sheba gave king Solomon ..... And king Solomon gave to
	the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked ..... So she
	turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.&quot;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The story
	of the Prophet Solomon and the queen of Sheba as given in the
	rabbinical traditions resembles in most parts with the Qur'anic
	version. The hopoe's absence, then its .arrival and reporting about
	Sheba and its queen, the Prophet Solomon's sending her a letter
	through it, the hoopoe's dropping the letter in front of the queen
	right at the time when she was going for sun-worship, the queen's
	calling for her ministers' council, then her sending of valuable
	gifts to Solomon, her traveling to Jerusalem and meeting him
	personally, her arrival in the palace and thinking that Prophet
	Solomon was sitting in the midst of a pool of water, tucking up her
	skirt in order to enter it-all this has been mentioned in these
	traditions as in the Qur'an. But there is no mention whatsoever in
	these traditions of the Prophet Solomon's reply on receipt of the
	gift, having the queen's th rune fetched from Ma'rib, his bowing
	down before God in thankfulness for every favor of His, and the
	queen's embracing the Faith ultimately, at his hand, his belief in
	the oneness of God, etc. And worst of all, these wicked people have
	accused Prophet Solomon of having committed adultery, God forbid,
	with the queen of Sheba, giving rise to an illegitimate race, which
	gave birth to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, who destroyed
	Jerusalem. (Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. XI, p. 443). The fact of the
	matter is that n section of the Jewish learned men have been highly
	critical of the Prophet Solomon. They have accused him of heinous
	crimes like violating the Commandments of the Torah, of pride of
	government, pride of wisdom, of being a hen-pecked husband, and of
	luxurious living, polytheism and idol-worship. (Jewish Encyclopedia,
	Vol. XI, pp. 439-441). It is due to this propaganda that the Bible
	presents him only as a king instead of a Prophet, a king who was
	lost in the love of polytheistic women against the Divine
	Commandments, whose heart was turned away from God, and was turned
	to other gods and goddesses. (I Kings, 11: 1-11). As against this it
	can be seen what great favor has the Qur'an done to the Israelites
	by cleansing the personalities of their elders of the tilth thrown
	at them by themselves, and yet the Israelites, ungrateful as they
	are, look upon the Qur'an and him who brought it as their enemies.

	opponents over and over again. Soon after he started his mission of
	inviting the people to the Faith, the delegation of the chiefs of
	the Quraish, who went to Abu Talib, had said, &quot;Give up to us
	this nephew of yours: he has opposed your religion and your

	the question whether Allah is better or the false deities appears to
	be odd. As a matter of fact, there can be no question of goodness in
	the false gods and, therefore, they cannot be compared to Allah. As
	for the polytheists, even they had no misconception that Allah could
	be compared to their gods. But they were asked this question in
	order to be warned against their error. For obviously none in the
	world would do anything unless he saw some good in it. Now if the
	polytheists served their deities and implored them for their needs
	instead of Allah, and presented their offerings before them, this
	would be meaningless unless they perceived some good in them. That
	is why they have been explicitly asked to consider whether Allah is
	better or their deities, for they could not face and answer this
	forth-right question. Even the most hardened polytheist among them
	could not venture to say that their deities were better. But if they
	acknowledged that Allah is better it would demolish their whole
	creed, for then it would be unreasonable to adopt the inferior
	against the superior creed. The Meaning of the Qur'an Thus, the
	Qur'an at the very outset made the opponents helpless. After this,
	pointed questions have been asked, one after the other, about the
	manifestations of the power and creation of Allah to the effect:
	&quot;Whose works are these? Is there besides Allah any other god
	also associated with these works'? If not, why have you then set up
	these others as your deities?&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to traditions, whenever the Holy Prophet recited this verse, he
	would immediately respond to it, saying: &quot;Nay, but Allah is
	better, and He alone is the Everlasting and Exalted and High.&quot;

	one from among the mushriks could answer that someone other than
	Allah had done these works, or someone else was Allah's associate in
	doing these. The Qur'an at other places says with respect to the
	pagans of Makkah and the Arab mushrikin: &quot;If you ask them, 'Who
	has created the heavens and the earth?' they will surely say: 'The
	All-Mighty, the All-Knowing One has created them'.&quot;
	(Az-Zukhruf: 9) &quot;And if you ask them, Who has created them?
	they will surely say, 'Allah'.&quot; (Az-Zukhruf: 87), &quot;If you
	ask them, 'Who sent down rain water from the sky and thereby raised
	the dead earth back to life ?' They will surely say, 'Allah'.&quot;
	(Al-`Ankabut: 63). &quot;Ask them: Who provides for you from the
	heavens and the earth? Who has power over these faculties of hearing
	and sight? Who brings forth the living from the dead and the dead
	from the living? Who controls and directs the system of the
	universe?' They will surely say, 'Allah'.&quot; (Yunus: 31 ). Not
	only the polytheists of Arabia but of the whole world generally
	acknowledged, and acknowledge even today, that Allah is the Creator
	of the universe and He alone controls and directs its system.
	Therefore, none of them could answer this question even obstinately
	for the sake of the argument that their deities were Allah's
	associates in those works, for if he had done so, thousands of his
	own people would have belied him saying that, that was not their
	belief.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This and
	the other questions that follow not only contain a refutation of the

	this first very question, it has been asked, &quot;Who has sent down
	rainwater and caused to spring up by it beautiful gardens?&quot;
	Just consider whether the presence of the substances essential for
	the growth of countless kinds of plant life, in the soil or near the
	soil, and the existence in water of those very qualities which are
	in accordance with the requirements of animal and vegetable life,
	and the evaporation of this water again and again from the seas, and
	its condensation and raining regularly in different parts of the
	earth from time to time, and the coordination between the soil and
	the air, the water, the temperature;.etc., conducive to proper
	growth of plant life and fulfillment of the countless requirements
	of every sort of animal life, could be just accidental, or the
	result of the wise scheming and planning the supreme power and will
	of an All-Wise Designer. And is it possible that this accident
	should continue to recur constantly for millions and millions of
	years on end? Only an obstinate person who has been blinded by
	prejudice will regard it as accidental, for no truth loving,
	sensible person can make such a senseless claim or accept it.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote74sym" HREF="#sdfootnote74anc">74</A>It
	is not a simple thing for the earth to be a place of rest for the
	countless kinds of different creations living on it. If man looks
	into the wise harmony and coordination with which this sphere of the
	earth has been established, he is simply amazed and starts feeling
	that these harmonies and concordances and relations could not be
	brought about without the grand design of an All-Wise, All Knowing
	and All-Powerful God. This sphere of the earth is floating in space
	and is not resting on anything, yet there is no commotion and no
	vibration in its movement. Had there been any vibration in it, such
	as we experience during an earthquake, life could not exist here.
	This sphere comes before the sun and hides from it regularly, which
	causes the alternation of the day and night. Had it turned the same
	face perpetually towards the sun and kept the other side always
	hidden, no life could be possible here, for on the bright side all
	life would have been shriveled up, and on the dark side all life
	would have been frozen to death. The sphere is enveloped by a five
	hundred mile thick atmosphere, which protects it against the'
	continual bombardment of meteors, otherwise the twenty million
	meteors on the average, which dart towards the earth daily at 30
	miles per second, would have caused such destruction as would not
	have allowed any man animal or tree to survive. The same atmosphere
	controls the temperature, raises clouds from the oceans, carries
	water to different parts of the earth and provides the required
	gases that sustain the human, animal and plant life. Without it the
	earth could not become a fit place of rest for any kind of animal
	life. Just under the earth's surface all those minerals and
	chemicals which are essential to the survival of vegetable and
	animal life have been provided in abundance. Wherever these natural
	resources do not exist, the land there cannot sustain any kind of
	life. A great store of water has been arranged on the earth in the
	form of oceans, rivers, lakes, springs and underground channels and
	snow on the mountains which melts and flows down in the form of
	rivers. Without such an arrangement there could be no life. Then the
	earth has been endowed with an appropriate gravitational pull by
	which it keeps the water and the air and all other things found on
	it attracted to it. If this pull had been a little less strong, it
	could not have stopped the air and the water from escaping. It would
	also have so much increased the temperature that life here would
	have become difficult. On the other hand, if the gravitational pull
	had been a little stronger, the atmosphere would have been denser,
	its pressure would have increased, evaporation would have become
	difficult and rains impossible; the cold would have increased and
	less areas on earth would have been inhabitable; men and animals
	would have been shorter in size but heavier in weight, which would
	have made movement difficult. Besides, this sphere has been located
	at a suitable distance from the sun, which is most appropriate for
	the population here. If the distance had been longer, the earth
	would have received less of heat, the climate would have been much
	colder, the seasons much longer and the earth would be hardly
	inhabitable. On the other hand, if the distance had been shorter,
	the intensity of the heat along with other factors would have
	rendered it unfit for the kind of life man is living here.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These are
	a few of those harmonies and concordances due to which earth has
	become a place of rest for its population. A man with a little
	common sense who is aware of these facts cannot imagine for a moment
	that these concordances have come into existence without the design
	of an All-Wise Creator, as a mere accident, nor can he ever conceive
	that a god or goddess, jinn or prophet, saint or angel, could have
	had any hand in the creation and bringing into operation of this

	simple fact hat has been expressed in this one sentence is so vast
	in meaning and detail that as one considers it more and more deeply
	one goes on getting new and ever new proofs of Allah's existence and
	His unity. to the first place, take the question of the creation
	itself. Man by his knowledge has not been able to discover what is
	life, how and where form it comes. So far the admitted scientific
	fact is that the mere arrangement of inanimate matter by itself
	cannot bring about life. Though the atheists assume,
	unscientifically, that life comes into existence automatically when
	all the elements essential for its creation combine together
	accidentally in the right proportion, yet if the mathematical law of
	chance is applied to it, the possibility of its occurrence comes to
	naught. All attempts made so far to produce animate matter out of
	inanimate matter experimentally in the laboratory have met with
	utter failure in spite of employing every possible care. At the most
	what has been created is DNA, which is the basic constituent of the
	living cell. This is the essence of life but not life itself. Life
	in itself even now is a miracle which cannot be explained
	scientifically except by saying that it is the result of a Creator's
	will and command and design. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Furthermore,
	life does not exist in a solitary form but in a limitless variety of
	forms. Man has so far discovered more or less a million species of
	animals and two hundred thousand species of plants on the earth,
	which in their constitution and special characteristics are so
	clearly and absolutely different from one another, and have been
	maintaining their distinctive features since the earliest known
	times so consistently that no Darwin could ever give any rational
	explanation of this great variety of life except the existence of
	the creative design of One God. Not a link has so far been
	discovered between any two species, which might have broken up the
	form of the characteristics and constitution of one species and
	might be struggling to attain the characteristics and constitution
	of another species. The whole record of the fossils is without such
	a precedent, and among the existing animals also there is no such
	&quot;eunuch&quot; in its physical form. Any member of any species
	that exists is found with the distinctive features of its own
	species, and every story that is invented and announced from time to
	tune about the discovery of some missing link is destroyed by the
	facts themselves. Therefore, the inevitable fact is that it is the
	All-Wise Designer, the Planner of creation, its Enforcer and its
	Fashioner, Who has endowed life with all its countless different
	forms. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This was
	about the beginning of the creation. Now let us consider its
	reproduction. The Creator has placed in the constitution and
	snake-up of every animal and vegetable species such a wonderful
	mechanism, which goes on producing through its countless members an
	endless race exactly with its own distinctive form and nature and
	characteristics, and it never has happened even by mistake that in
	these millions and millions of tiny sex workshops a certain workshop
	of a species may have turned out a specimen of a different species.
	The observations of modern Genetics in this connection present
	wonderful facts. Every plant has been so endowed with the capability
	of procreating its species that the new generation should possess
	all the distinctive characteristics of its own species and its every
	member should be distinguished in its special features from the
	members of all other species. This element for the survival of the
	species and its procreation is contained in a part of a cell of
	every plant, which can be seen with effort only through a most
	powerful microscope. This tiny engineer directs the whole
	development the plant precisely and definitely on the way which is
	the way .of its own distinctive species. That is why all the plants
	that have emerged from a grain of wheat arty where in the world have
	in turn produced only wheat. In no climate and in no region has it
	ever happened that from the whole race of a grain of wheat even a
	single grain of barley might have emerged. The same is the case with
	animals and men. None of them has been created just for once, but on
	an inconceivably high scale a huge factory of reproduction is
	functioning every where, which is constantly bringing into
	existence, from the members of every species, countless other
	members of the same species. If one considers the microscopic germ
	of procreation which along with all the distinctive features and
	hereditary characteristics of its species is found in a small
	portion of its tiny self and thou looks at the extremely delicate
	and complex physiological system and the subtle, intricate processes
	by which the procreative seed of every member of every species
	produces a member of the same species, one cannot conceive for a
	moment that such a tine and subtle system could come into being by
	itself, and then keep on functioning by itself in millions and
	millions of the members of different species. This thing stands in
	need of an All-Wise Designer not only for its beginning but for its
	proper and perpetual functioning also it needs an Administrator Who
	is at once Wise and Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent, Who is ever
	watching and guiding the work of these workshops.

	in this work of God, but no unbiased person possessed of a little

	Being, the All-Knowing Allah. For Him nothing is unknown everything
	is known and evident. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In order
	to bring out this reality the method of the question as employed
	above with regard to creation, design and sustenance of the universe
	has not been adopted here. The reason is that the manifestations of
	those attributes are clear and evident which everyone sees, and
	which even the pagans and polytheists acknowledged, and do even
	today, that they are the works of Allah. So, the argument adopted
	above was: When all these works, as you admit, are being done by
	Allah, and no one else is His partner in these, why have you then
	made others His associates in Divinity, and in His worship? However,
	the attribute of knowledge . has no perceptible manifestation which
	may be referred to and pointed out. It can be comprehended only by
	thought and reflection. Therefore, it has been put forward as an
	assertion instead of a question. Now it is for every intelligent
	person to think and consider for himself whether it is reasonable to
	believe that there should be any other than Allah, who is
	all-knowing, i.e. who knows all those conditions and things and
	realities which existed in the universe in the past; or exist now;
	or will exist in the future. And if there is none other who is all
	knowing, and cannot be, then is it reasonable to believe that any of
	those who are not aware fully of the realities and conditions and
	circumstances can become the answerer of the people's prayers,
	fulfiller of their needs and remover of their hardships ? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is
	a subtle relationship between Divinity and the knowledge of the
	unseen and hidden. Since the earliest times in whatever being has
	man imagined the presence of an attribute of Godhead, he has taken
	it for granted that it knows everything and nothing is hidden from
	it. In other words, it is self-evident for man to believe that
	making or marring the destinies, answering the prayers, fulfilling
	the needs and helping everyone in need of help, can be the work of
	the being who knows everything and from whom nothing is hidden. That
	is why whomever man has regarded as possessor of the powers and
	authority of Godhead he has necessarily regarded him as the knower
	of all hidden things as well. For his intellect testifies rightly
	that knowledge and authority are inter-dependent. Now if it is a
	fact that none but God is the Creator and the Designer and the
	Answerer of the prayers and the Providence, as has been proved in
	the foregoing verses, then it is also a self-evident reality that
	none but God is the Knower of the hidden things. After all, who in
	his senses could imagine that an angel or a jinn or a prophet or a
	saint or any other creature would be knowing where and what kinds of
	animals existed in the oceans and in the atmosphere and under the
	layers of the earth and upon its surface? And what is the correct
	number of the planets in the heavens? And what kinds of creatures
	exist in each of them? And where is each one of these creatures
	living and what are its requirements? All this should necessarily be
	known to Allah, because He has created them and He alone has to
	watch over their conditions and control their affairs and arrange
	for their sustenance. But how can some one else with his limited
	self have this vast and all-embracing knowledge and what has he to
	do with the functions of creation and sustenance that he should know
	these things? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then this
	quality is also not divisible in the sense that a person, for
	instance, may be the knower of everything on the earth, or the
	knower of everything concerning human beings only, on the earth. It
	is in the same way indivisible as are God's Creativity and His
	Providence and His Self-Subsistence indivisible. After all, how can
	it be possible for one to know all the affairs and all the
	conditions and states of all human beings who have been born in the
	world since the beginning of creation, and will be born till
	Resurrection, from the time their mothers conceived them till the
	time they will breath their last ? And how and why will he know all
	this ? Is he the creator of these countless multitudes ? Did he
	create their seed in their fathers' sperm-drop ? Did he mold and
	shape them in their mother's womb? Did he arrange for their normal
	birth'? Did he make the destiny of each one of them? Is he
	responsible for taking decisions with regard to their life and
	death, their health and ill-health, their prosperity and adversity,
	and their rise and fall in the world ? And since when did he become
	responsible for it? Since before his own birth or since after it ?
	And how can these responsibilities remain confined only to human
	beings? This is only a part of the universal administration of the
	heavens and the earth. The Being Who is controlling the whole
	universe is the Being Who alone can be responsible for the creation
	and death of men, for restricting and extending their provisions and
	for making and marring their destinies.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">That is
	why it is a fundamental article of Islam that none other than Allah
	is the Knower of the hidden and unseen things. Allah may disclose

	He pleases and bless him with the knowledge of one or more of the
	hidden things as a whole. Being the Knower of all hidden and unseen
	things is the attribute only of Allah, Who is the Lord of all
	creation &quot;He alone has the keys of the `unseen' of which none
	has the knowledge but He.&quot; (Al-An`am: 59) &quot;Allah alone has
	the knowledge of the Hour: He alone sends down the rain and He alone
	knows what is (taking shape) in the wombs of the mothers. No living
	being knows what he will earn the next day, nor does anybody know in
	what land he will die.&quot; (Luqman 34) &quot;He knows what is
	before the people and also what is hidden from them; and they cannot
	comprehend anything of His knowledge save whatever He Himself may
	please to reveal.&quot; (Al Baqarah: 255). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Qur'an does not rest content with this general and absolute negation
	of the knowledge of the hidden and unseen for the different forms of
	creation, but about the Prophets in particular, and the Holy Prophet
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) himself it clearly says that
	they do not possess the knowledge of the hidden and unseen, and that
	they were given only that much knowledge of the hidden by Allah as
	was necessary to enable them to carry out the duties of Prophethood.
	Surah Al-An`am.: 50, Al-A'raf: 187, At-Taubah: 101, Hud: 31,
	AlAhzab: 63, Al-Ahqaf: 9, At-Tahrim: 3 and Al-Jinn: 26-28 do not
	leave any room for doubt in this regard. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">All these
	elucidations of the Qur'an support and explain the verse under
	discussion after which there remains no doubt that looking upon
	another than Allah as the knower of the hidden and unseen and
	believing that someone else also possesses the knowledge of all the
	past and future events, is an absolutely un-Islamic belief. Bukhari,
	Muslim, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Imam Ahmad, Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abu Hatim
	have cited this saying of Hadrat `A'ishah. through authentic
	reporters: &quot;Whoever claimed that the Holy Prophet (peace be
	upon him) knew what was going to happen the next day, accused Allah
	of lying, for Allah says: O Prophet, say, `None in the heavens and
	the earth has the knowledge of the hidden and unseen but Allah'.&quot;
	Ibn al-Mundhir has reported this on the authority of 'Ikrimah, the
	well-known pupil of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas: &quot;A person
	asked the Holy Prophet: O Muhammad, when will Resurrection be? And
	our territory is suffering from famine: when will it rain ? And my
	wife is pregnant: what will she deliver, a boy or a girl? And I know
	what I have earned today; but what shall I earn tomorrow? And I know
	where I was born, but where shall I die?&quot; In reply, the Holy
	Prophet recited verse 34 of Surah Luqman as cited above. Then the
	well-known Tradition as reported in Bukhari; and Muslim and other
	works of Hadith also supports the same. According to it one of the
	questions asked by Angel Gabriel from the Holy Prophet when he sat
	among the Companions in human shape before him, was: &quot;When will
	Resurrection be?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;The one being
	questioned knows no better than the one questioning.&quot; Then
	added, &quot;This is one of those five things whose knowledge is
	possessed by none but Allah,&quot; and then he recited the
	above-cited verse of Surah Luqman .

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote86sym" HREF="#sdfootnote86anc">86</A>This
	brief sentence contains two strong arguments for the Hereafter as
	well as admonition: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Firstly,
	those communities who rejected the Hereafter could not help becoming
	criminals: they lived irresponsibly; they committed cruelties and
	all kinds of sin; and ultimately their moral depravity led them to
	utter ruin. This continuous experience of human history which is
	testified by the doomed communities all over the world, clearly
	shows that belief and unbelief in the Hereafter has a deep
	relationship with the soundness or the unsoundness of human
	behavior. Belief in it generates sound behavior and denial of it
	unsound behavior. This is a clear proof of the fact that belief in
	it is in accordance with the reality; that is why belief helps life
	to follow the right path. And rejection of it is against the
	reality; that is why rejection leads life into crooked alleys. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	the destruction of the communities, which became criminals, one
	after the other, in the long experience of history is a clear
	pointer to the fact that this universe is not being ruled by the
	deaf and blind and senseless forces, but this is a wise system which
	is functioning according to the unalterable law of retribution,
	which is dealing with the human communities only on moral grounds,
	in which no community is given long enough rope to commit whatever
	evil it likes and continue to enjoy life and commit injustices after
	it has once risen to power and prosperity. But when a wicked
	community happens to reach a certain stage, a mighty hand topples it
	from power and hurls it into the abyss of ignominy. Anyone who
	realizes this fact can have no doubt that the same law of
	retribution calls for the establishment of a new world after this
	world, where all individuals and nations and the whole mankind
	collectively should be rewarded and punished for their deeds. For
	the requirements of justice cannot be fulfilled only by the
	destruction of a wicked nation; this does not in any way redress the
	grievances of the oppressed people; this does not punish those who
	had enjoyed life and left the world before the coming down of the
	scourge; this does not also take to task those wicked people who
	went on leaving behind them legacies of immoralities and deviations
	for the coming generations. The torment that visited the nation only
	put a stop to the further tyrannies of its last generation. The
	court has not yet started working, to punish every wicked person for
	the evil done, to compensate every oppressed person for the losses
	incurred, and to reward all those who stood by the right against the
	onslaught of evil, endeavored to reform things and faced
	persecutions in this way throughout their lives. All this should
	necessarily happen at some time. For the continuous operation in the
	world of the law of retribution clearly points to the temperament
	and technique of the ruling government of the universe that it
	judges human deeds by moral standards and punishes and rewards them
	accordingly.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides
	these two arguments, the aspect of admonition in this verse is:
	&quot;Learn lessons from the fate of the guilty people of the past,
	and do not persist in the foolish belief of the denial of the
	Hereafter, which, in fact, was responsible for making them
	criminals. &quot;

	&quot;no wonder&quot;, etc. occur in the Divine discourse, they do
	not contain any sense of doubt, but express Allah's Independence and
	Self-Sufficiency. Allah's power is so great that His willing a thing
	and its happening is one and the same thing. It is inconceivable
	that He should will a thing and it should not happen. Therefore,

	are a part of the Israelite history, and which are being disputed by

	to Ibn `Umar, this will happen when there remains no one in the
	world to command the people to do good and forbid them to do evil.
	Ibn Marduyah has reported a Hadith on the authority of Abu Said
	Khudri; according to which the latter heard the same thing from the
	Holy Prophet himself. This shows that when man gives up the duty of
	exhorting others to do good and forbidding them to do evil, Allah
	will bring forth a beast to serve as the final warning just before
	Resurrection. This, however, is not clear whether it will be just
	one beast, or a particular species of beasts, who will spread all
	over the earth. The words daabbat-an-min-al-ard might contain both
	the meanings. In any case, what it will say will be: &quot;The
	people did not believe Allah's Revelations in which Resurrection was
	foretold. Now the same Resurrection is about to come; Iet everyone
	know that what Allah said was true&quot;. The sentence, &quot;The
	people did not believe in Our Revelations&quot;, is either a part of
	the beast's own speech, or Allah's narration of its words. If these
	are its own words, the word &quot;Our&quot; will be understood in
	the style of an official who speaks on behalf of his government and
	not on his personal behalf. In the second case, since Allah is
	narrating the beast's words, He has used &quot;Our Revelations&quot;
	in the normal sense.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As to the
	time and occasion of the appearance of this beast, the Holy Prophet
	has said: &quot;The sun will rise in the west and the beast will
	suddenly appear in the open daylight. Whichever of these signs
	appears first, it will be closely followed by the other.&quot;
	(Muslim) In the other traditions related in Muslim, Ibn Majah,
	Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad, etc. the Holy Prophet foretold that the
	signs of Resurrection-emergence of the Anti-Christ (Dajjal),
	appearance of the beast, smoke and the rising of the sun in the west

	will have taken place, each limb of man-his ears, his eyes, even his

	the Messengers of Allah that Resurrection will take place, and a new
	World will be established when everyone will be called to account
	for his deeds. Therefore, they will neither be bewildered nor
	alarmed, which will be the case with those who had denied this Day
	and retrained heedless of it, till their last breath in the world
	.They will also be satisfied because they had worked for this Day
	and had brought necessary provisions from the world for their
	success here. Therefore, they will not be stupefied and confounded
	as will be those who had invested all their energies and
	capabilities 'in their struggle for achieving worldly successes
	only, and had never thought that there would be life hereafter also
	for which they should make some provision. Contrary to them, the
	believers will be satisfied that the Day for the sake of which they
	had given up the unlawful benefits and pleasures of life and had
	undergone hardships and toil, had at last come, and they will not be
	deprived of the rewards of their works.&quot;

	will be punished in the Hereafter only to the extent of the evil
	committed, but a good act will be rewarded much more generously by
	Allah than what the doer will actually deserve for it. For more

	this Surah was sent down at a stage when the message of Islam was
	confined to Makkah and its addressees were the people of that City
	only, it was said, &quot;I have been commanded that I should worship
	the Lord of this City.&quot; And the characteristic of the Lord was
	stated to be that He had made that City sacred. This was meant to
	warn the disbelievers of Makkah, as if to say, &quot; You may if you
	so like prove thankless to that God Who has done you the great favor
	of making this City of yours a haven of peace in the strife-ridden
	land of Arabia, and Who by His grace has made it the center of
	spiritual affiliation for the whole of Arabia, but I have been
	commanded to be grateful to him and bow down before Him. None of
	your deities had the power to make this City a sanctuary and make
	the quarrelsome and plundering tribes of Arabia have respect for it.
	I cannot abandon my real Benefactor and bow down before those who
	have done me no favor at all.</P>
