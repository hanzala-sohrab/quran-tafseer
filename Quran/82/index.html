theme is the Hereafter. According to a tradition related in Musnad
Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn al-Mundhir, Tabarani, Hakim and Ibn Marduyah, on
the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin Umar, the Holy Messenger (upon
whom be peace) said: &quot;The one who wants that he should see the
Resurrection Day as one would see it with one's eyes, should read
Surah At-Takwir, Surah Al-Infitar and Surah Al-Inshiqaq.&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this Surah first the Resurrection Day has been described and it is
said that when it occurs, every person will see whatever he has done
in the world. After this, man has been asked to ponder the question:
&quot;O man, what has deluded you into thinking that the God, Who
brought you into being and by Whose favor and bounty you possess the
finest body, limbs and features among all creatures, is only
bountiful and not just? His being bountiful and generous does not
mean that you should become fearless of His justice.&quot;Then, man
has been warned, so as to say: &quot;Do not remain involved in any
misunderstanding. Your complete record is being prepared. There are
trustworthy writers who are writing down whatever you do.&quot; In
conclusion, it has been forcefully stated that the Day of
Resurrection will surely take place when the righteous shall enjoy
every kind of bliss in Paradise and the wicked shall be punished in
Hell. On that day no one shall avail anyone anything. All powers of
judgment shall be with Allah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	Surah At-Takwir it has been said: &quot;When the oceans are set
	ablaze,&quot; and here: &quot;When the oceans are torn apart.&quot;
	When the two verses are read together, and this fact also is kept in
	view that even according to the Qur'an a terrible earthquake will
	occur on the Resurrection Day, which will shake up the entire earth
	all at once, the state of the splitting of the oceans and their
	being set ablaze ' seems to be as follows: first, because of the
	terrible convulsion, the bottom of the oceans will split asunder and
	their water will start sinking into the interior of the earth where
	an intensely hot lava is constantly boiling up. Coming into contact
	with the lava, water will dissolve into its two constituent parts,
	oxygen which helps combustion, and hydrogen, which is itself
	combustible. Thus, in the process pf dissolution and combustion, a
	chain reaction will start, which will set all the oceans 'of the
	world ablaze. This is our conjecture, the correct knowledge is only
	with Allah.&nbsp;

	is, &quot;There is no reasonable ground for you to be deluded. Your
	own physical existence itself tells that you did not come into being
	by yourself; your parents also did not make you. Man also did not
	come about as a result of the elements combining together by
	themselves accidentally; but a Wise and Powerful God has composed
	you into this perfect human shape and form. There are other kinds of
	animals in the world compared with which your excellent form and
	structure and your superior powers and faculties stand out in sharp
	contrast. Reason demanded that in view of all this you should have
	submitted gratefully and should never have dared commit disobedience
	of your beneficent Sustainer. You also know that your Lord and
	Sustainer is not only Compassionate and Bountiful but Almighty and
	Omnipotent as well. When an earthquake, cyclone or flood occurs by
	His Command, all your devices and measures tail to be effective. You
	also know that your Lord and Sustainer is not ignorant and foolish
	but Wise and knowing, and the necessary demand of wisdom and
	knowledge is that whoever is given intellect should also be held
	responsible for his acts; whoever is given powers should also be
	held accountable as to how he used those powers; and whoever is
	given the choice to do good or evil on his own responsibility,
	should also be rewarded for his good act and punished for his evil
	act. All these truths are clearly and plainly known to you;
	therefore, you cannot say that there exists a reasonable ground for
	you to be deluded concerning your Lord. Your own nature is
	sufficient evidence that the beneficence of the Master should never
	cause the servant to be fearless of Him, and be involved in the
	misunderstanding that he may do whatever he pleases, no one can harm
	him in any way.&nbsp;

	is, &quot;whether you deny the meting out of rewards and
	punishments, belie it, or mock it, the reality cannot change. The
	reality is .that your Lord has not left you to your self in the
	world, but has appointed over each one of you honest and upright
	guardians, who are recording objectively and faithfully all your
	good and evil acts, and none of your acts is hidden from them,
	whether you commit it in darkness, or in private, or in far off
	jungles, or in secret when you are fully satisfied that whatever you
	have done bas remained hidden from human eye. For these guardian
	angels Allah has used the words kiram-an katibin, i.e. writers who
	are honorable and noble They are neither attached in personal love
	with somebody, nor are inimical to anybody, so that they would
	prepare a fictitious record on the basis of their favoring one man
	and disfavoring another unduly. They are neither dishonest that
	without being present on duty they would make wrong entries by
	themselves; nor are they bribable so that they would take bribes and
	make false reports in favor of or against somebody. They are far
	above these moral weaknesses. Therefore, both the good and the bad
	people should be fully satisfied that each man's good acts will be
	recorded without any omission, and no one will have an evil act
	recorded in his account which he has not done. Then the second
	quality that has been mentioned of these angels is: &quot;They know
	whatever you do &quot; That is, they are not like the secret,
	intelligence agencies of the world, from which, despite all their
	search and scrutiny, many things remain hidden. They are fully aware
	of everyone's deeds. They accompany every person, at all places,
	under all conditions, in such a way that he himself does not know
	that someone is watching him, and they also know with what intention
	has somebody done a certain thing. Therefore the record prepared by
	them is a complete record in which nothing has been left
	un-recorded. About this very thing it has been said in Surah Al-Kahf
	49: &quot;Woe to us! What sort of a book it is, it has left nothing
	unrecorded of our doings, small or great. They will see before them
	everything, whatever they had done.&quot;
