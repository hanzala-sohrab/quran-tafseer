that a bitter conflict had begun between the, Holy Prophet and the
disbelievers of Makkah, though the persecution by them had not yet
become tyrannical. It appears that the surah was sent down during the
climax of the &quot;Famine&quot; in Makkah (vv. 75-76), which
according to authentic traditions occurred during the middle stage of
Prophethood. Moreover, according to a tradition related by 'Urwah bin
Zubair, Hadarat Umar who had embraced Islam by that time, said, &quot;This
Surah was revealed in my presence and I myself observed the state of
the Holy Prophet during its revelation. When the revelation ended ,
the Holy Prophet remarked, 'On this occasion ten such verses have
been sent down to me that the one who measures up to them, will most
surely go to Paradise'. Then he recited the initial verses of the
surah.&quot; (Ahmad, Tirmizi, Nasai, Hakim). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

relating the stories of the Prophets, a fundamental principle has
been enunciated: Success and prosperity in the worldly life is not a
criterion of success in the sight of Allah. If some persons (or a
person) are enjoying prosperity, wealth, power and the like in this
world, it does not mean that they are favorites of Allah. Likewise,
the poverty and adversity of other people is not a proof that Allah
is displeased with them. The real criterion is Faith (or lack of it).
This declaration was needed because the antagonists of the Holy
Prophet were the great chiefs of Makkah, who (and their followers)
were deluded by their own prosperity that God and their deities were
well pleased with them. On the other hand, they argued, the fact that
Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) and his followers were indigent
and in a state of helplessness, was a clear proof that Allah was not
pleased with them, and they were under the curse of their deities. </FONT></FONT></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">55

	the disbelievers that the criterion of success and failure that they
	had in mind was not correct. It was based on misconceptions besides
	being transitory and limited in nature: it led to failure and not
	true success. On the contrary, the followers of Muhammad (Allah's

	successful, because by accepting the invitation to the Right
	Guidance given by the Messenger of Allah, they had struck a bargain

	in the Text is from khushu (to bow down, to express humility) which
	is a condition of the heart as well as of the body. Khushu' of the
	heart is to fear and stand in awe of a powerful person, and khushu `
	of the body is to bow one's head and lower one's gaze and voice in
	his presence. In Salat one is required to show khushu ` both of the
	heart and of the body, and this is the essence of the Prayer. It has
	been reported that when the Holy Prophet once saw a person offering
	his Prayer as well as playing with his beard, he remarked: &quot;Had
	he khushu ` in his heart, his body would have manifested it. &quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Though
	khushu ` is actually a condition of the heart, as stated by the
	above tradition, it is manifested by the body as a matter of course.
	The Shari `ah has enjoined certain etiquette which, on the one hand,
	helps produce khushu ` in the heart, and on the other, helps sustain
	the physical act of the Prayer in spite of the fluctuating condition
	of the heart. According to this etiquette, one should neither turn
	to the right or left, nor raise one's head to look up: one may,
	however, look around from the corner of the eye, but as far as
	possible, one must fix the gaze on the place where the forehead
	would rest in prostration; one is also forbidden to shift about,
	incline side ways, fold the garments or shake off dust from them. It
	is also forbidden that while going down for prostration, one should
	clean the place where one would sit or perform prostration.
	Similarly it is disrespectful that one should stand stuffy erect,
	recite the verses of the Qur'an in a loud resounding voice, or sing
	them, or belch or yawn repeatedly and noisily. It has also not been
	approved that one should offer the Prayer in a hurry. The injunction
	is that each article of the Prayer should be performed in perfect
	peace and tranquility, and unless one article has been completely
	performed, the next should not be begun. If one feels hurt by
	something during the Prayer, one may cast it aside by one hand, but
	moving the hand repeatedly or using both the hands for the purpose
	is prohibited. with this etiquette of the body, it is also important
	that one should irrelevant things during the Prayer. If thoughts

	an examination paper with his whole mind and body and soul absorbed
	in it. Just as the student knows and feels that each moment of the
	limited time at his disposal is important and decisive for his
	future life, and is not inclined to waste it, so the Believer also
	spends each moment of his life on works which are useful and
	productive in their ultimate results. So much so that even in
	matters of recreation and sport, he makes a choice of only those
	things which prepare him for higher ends in life and do not result
	in mere wastage of time. For him time is not something to be killed

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>The
	word Zakat literally means purification and development-to help
	something grow tip smoothly and develop without obstruction. As an
	Islamic term, it implies both the portion of wealth taken out for
	the purpose of purifying the rest of wealth and the act of
	purification itself. The words of the original Text mean that the
	Believer constantly practices purification. Thus the meaning is not
	confined to the paying off of Zakat dues only but it is extended to
	self-purification which includes purification of morals as well as
	wealth, property and life in general. Then it does not mean
	purification of one's own self, but includes the purification of the
	lives of other people as well. So the verse means: &quot;The
	Believers are the people who purify themselves as well as others.&quot;
	This thing has been stated at other places in the Qur'an -also, for
	instance: &quot;Successful is he who practiced -purification and
	remembered his Lord and prayed.&quot; (LXXXVII: 1415), and:
	&quot;Successful is he who purified himself and failure is he who

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote7sym" HREF="#sdfootnote7anc">7</A>This
	is a parenthesis which is meant to remove the common
	misunderstanding that sex desire is an evil thing in itself and
	satisfying it even in lawful ways is not desirable, particularly for
	the righteous and godly people. This misunderstanding would have
	been strengthened had it been only said that the Believers guard
	their private parts scrupulously, because it would have implied that
	they live unmarried lives, away from the world, like monks and
	hermits. Therefore a parenthesis has been added to say that there is
	nothing wrong in satisfying the sex desire in lawful ways. What is
	evil is that one should transgress the prescribed limits for
	satisfying the sex desire.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here are
	briefly a few injunctions which are based on this parenthetical
	clause: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) Two
	categories of women have been excluded from the general command of
	guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in
	ode's possession, i.e. slave-girls. Thus the verse clearly lays down
	the law that one is allowed to have sexual relations with one's
	slave-girl as with one's wife. the basis being possession and not
	marriage. If marriage had been the condition, the slave-girl also
	would have been included among the wives, and there was no need to
	mention them separately. Some modern commentators, who dispute the
	permissibility of having sexual relations with the slave-girl, argue
	from An-Nisa' (IV) : 25 to prove that one can have sexual relations
	with a slave-girl only after entering wedlock with her, because that
	verse enjoins that if a person cannot afford to marry a free Muslim
	woman, he may marry a Muslim slave-girl. But these commentators have
	a strange characteristic: they accept a part of a verse if it suits
	them, but conveniently ignore another part of the same verse if it
	goes against their wish and whim. The law about marrying the
	slave-girls as enunciated in IV :25 reads: &quot;....you may marry
	them with the permission of their guardians and give them their fair
	dowries.&quot; Obviously the person under reference here is not the
	master of the slave girl himself but the person who cannot afford to
	marry a free Muslim woman, and therefore , wants to marry a
	slave-girl, who is in the possession of another person. For if the
	question had been of marrying one's own slave-girl, who would then
	be the &quot;guardian&quot; whose permission would have to be
	sought? Then, the interpretation they give of this verse contradicts
	other verses dealing with the same subject in the Qur'an. A sincere
	person who wants to understand the Qur'anic law in this regard
	should study An-Nisa' (IV); 3, 25; AI-Ahzab (XXXIII): S0, 52, and
	Al-Ma`arij (LXX): 30 together with this verse of Al-Mu'minun. (For
	further explanation, see E.N. 44 of An-Nisa). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	law prescribed in the parenthesis is only applicable to men as is
	clear from the Text. A woman in the time of Hadrat `Umar did not
	understand this fine point of the language and indulged in sexual
	gratification with her slave. When her case was brought before the
	consultative body of the Companions, they gave the unanimous
	decision: &quot;She misinterpreted the Book of Allah&quot; Nobody
	should entertain the doubt that if this exception is meant for the
	men only, how could then the husbands become lawful for the wives?
	This doubt is unjustified because when the husbands are exempted
	from the command of guarding their private parts in regard to their
	wives, the wives automatically stand exempted from the command with
	regard to their husbands, and there is no nerd to grant them
	exemption separately. Thus the command of exemption remains
	applicable and effective only in respect of the man and the woman
	legally in his possession, and the slave becomes unlawful for the
	woman possessing him. The wisdom of why the slave has been forbidden
	to the woman is that he can only satisfy her sexual desire but
	cannot become guardian and governor of herself and her household,
	which leaves a serious flaw in the family life. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	sentence &quot;.... but those who go beyond this (in lust for sexual
	desire), shall be transgressors&quot; has made satisfaction of sex
	desire in other ways unlawful, whether it be through fornication,
	homosexuality, sex gratification with animals, or some other means.
	The jurists differ only with regard to masturbation. Imam Ahmad bin
	Hanbal regards it as lawful, but Imams Malik and Shafi`i regard it
	as absolutely unlawful: and though the Hanafites also regard it as
	unlawful, they give the opinion that if a person indulges sometimes
	in masturbation under the fit of passion, it is expected that he
	will be forgiven the error. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) Some
	commentators have proved the prohibition of Mut ah (temporary
	marriage) from this verse. They argue that the &quot;woman with whom
	one has entered into wedlock temporarily, can neither be regarded as
	a Wife nor a slave-girl. A slave-girl obviously she is not, and she
	is also not a wife, because the legal injunctions normally
	applicable to the wife are not applicable to her. She neither
	inherits the man nor the man her; she is neither governed by the law
	pertaining to `Iddah (waiting period after divorce or death of
	husband), divorce, subsistence, nor by that pertaining to the vow by
	man that he will not have conjugal relations with her, false
	accusation, etc. She is also excluded from the prescribed limit of
	four wives. Thus, when she is neither a &quot;wife&quot; nor a
	&quot;slave-girl&quot; in any sense, she will naturally be included
	among those &quot;beyond this&quot;, whose seeker has been declared
	a &quot;transgressor&quot; by the Qur'an. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is a
	strong argument but due to a weakness in it,-it is difficult to say
	that this verse is decisive with regard to the prohibition of
	Mut`ah. The fact is that the Holy Prophet enjoined the final and
	absolute prohibition of Mut ah in the year of the conquest of
	Makkah, but before it Mut ah was allowed according to several
	authentic traditions. If Mut 'ah had been prohibited in this verse,
	which was admittedly revealed at Makkah, several years before the
	migration, how can it be imagined that the Holy Prophet kept the
	prohibition in abeyance till the conquest of Makkah? The correct
	position therefore is that prohibition of Mut ah is not based on any
	express law of the Qur'an but is based on the Sunnah of the Holy
	Prophet. Had it not beep prohibited by the Sunnah, it would have
	been difficult to declare it as prohibited only on the authority of
	this verse. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It would
	be worth-while to clarify two other points in connection with
	Mut'ah: (a) lts prohibition is based on the Sunnah of the Holy
	Prophet and therefore it is wrong to say that it was prohibited by
	Hadrat 'Umar. As a matter of fact, Hadrat `Umar only enforced it as
	a law of Islam and publicised it among the people. This had not been
	done earlier because the Holy Prophet had forbidden Mut 'ah only
	during the latter part of his worldly life. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b) The
	Shiite view that Mut ah is absolutely lawful and permissible has no
	sanction and support in the Qur'an or Sunnah. The fact is that a few
	of the Companions, their followers and jurists who regarded it
	permissible in the early days of Islam, did so only in case of
	extreme necessity and need. None of them held the view that it was
	absolutely lawful like marriage and could be practised in normal
	circumstances. Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Abbas, who is generally cited
	as a prominent supporter of the view of permissibility, has himself
	explained his position thus: &quot;It is just like carrion which is
	lawful for a person only in extreme necessity.&quot; Even Hadrat Ibn
	'Abbas had to revise his opinion when he saw that people were
	abusing permissibility and had started practising Mut ah freely
	regardless of genuine need and necessity. Again, even if the
	question, whether Hadrat Ibn '.Abbas and the few likeminded jurists
	had revised their opinion or not, is ignored, the fact is that the
	supporters of Mut'ah allow it only in case of extreme necessity.
	Holding Mut ah as absolutely permissible, practising it without any
	real necessity, or resorting to it even when one has a legally
	wedded wife or wives is a kind of licence which is abhorred by good
	taste, much less it be attributed to the Shari ah of Muhammad
	(Allah's peace be upon him) and imputed to the learned jurists of
	his family. I think that among the Shiite Muslims themselves no
	respectable person would like that somebody should ask for the hand
	of his daughter or sister not in marriage but for the purpose of
	Mutah. For if Mutah is held as absolutely permissible, it would
	imply that there should exist in society a low class of women, like
	the prostitutes, who should be available for the purpose as and when
	required, or if not that, Mutah be restricted to the daughters and
	sisters of the poor stratum of society and the well-to-do be given
	the freedom and right to exploit them as and when they like. Can
	such an injustice and discrimination be expected of the Divine Law?
	And will Allah and His Messenger permit an act which every
	respectable woman would regard not only disgraceful for herself but
	shameful, too?

	On the contrary, the one who was apparently deprived of these things

	on a very limited scale, and even in this, there is an aspect of the
	test. Therefore it is an utter folly to consider material &quot;success&quot;
	and &quot;prosperity&quot; to be a proof that the recipient is in
	the right and so the beloved of the Lord, and vice versa. Moreover,
	the tests and trials of individuals and communities are of many
	varieties and a seeker after truth must understand at the outset
	that the worldly &quot;success&quot; or &quot;failure&quot; of the

	must have a firm belief that truth and righteousness will ultimately
	gain victory over falsehood and wickedness. As regards the criterion
	of truth and falsehood and right and wrong, one must judge this in
	the light of Revelations and teachings of the Messengers, because
	common sense confirms the same, and it is also supported by the
	general conception which mankind has always had of good and evil.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) As a
	corollary of the above, it would have become clear that according to
	the Qur'an (and this is confirmed by common sense), the conception
	of &quot;reward&quot; and &quot;punishment&quot; should also be
	different from the common one. For instance, if a wicked person or
	community is enjoying &quot;prosperity&quot;, it is not a reward of
	its evil deeds but a harder test for it, and it is not a blessing
	but the wrath of Allah. It means that Allah has decided to punish
	the &quot;prosperous people&quot; with a severe scourge. On the
	other hand, if the righteous people are suffering from hardships and
	afflictions, it is not a punishment from Allah but a blessing in
	disguise to pass them through the &quot;fire&quot; to remove
	impurity, if any, from the pure gold. If this hard trial is a
	blessing for the righteous people, it is a test for the wicked
	people to give them a severe punishment for the persecution of the
	former.</P>
