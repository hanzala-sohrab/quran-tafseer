In addition, the people have also been warned that refusal to accept

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>About
the Hereafter what this Surah presents in short but pithy sentences
is this: The people's different and conflicting beliefs about the end
of human life are themselves an express proof that none of these
beliefs and creeds is based on knowledge; everyone by himself has
formed an ideology on the basis of conjecture and made the same his
creed. Someone thought that there would be no life-after-death;
someone believed in the life- after-death, but in the form of the
transmigration of souls someone believed in the life hereafter and
the meting out of the rewards and punishments but invented different
sorts of props and supports to escape retribution. About a question
of such vital and fundamental importance a wrong view of which
renders man's whole life-work wrong and waste and ruins his future
for ever, it would be a disastrous folly to build an ideology only on
the basis of speculation and conjecture, without knowledge. It would
mean that man should remain involved in a grave misunderstanding,
pass his whole life in the heedlessness of error, and after death
should suddenly meet with a situation for which he had made no
preparation at all. There is only one way of forming the right
opinion about such a question, and it is this: Man should seriously
ponder over the knowledge about the Hereafter that the Prophet of
Allah is conveying to him from Him, and should study carefully the
system of the earth and heavens and his own existence: and should see
whether the evidence of that knowledge's being sound and correct is
afforded by everything around him or not. In this regard, the
arrangement of the wind and rain, the structure of the earth and the
creatures found on it, man's own self, the creation of the heavens
and of everything in the world in the form of pairs have been
presented as evidence of the Hereafter, and instances have been cited
from human history to show that the temper of the empire of the
Universe requires that the law of retribution must operate here. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">briefly, it has been said : &quot;Your
Creator has not created you for the service of others but for His own
service. He is not like your false gods, which receive sustenance
from you and godhead of which cannot function without your help, but
He is a God Who is the Sustainer of all, Who does not stand in need
of sustenance from anyone and Whose Godhead is functioning by His own

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this very connection, it has also been stated that whenever the
Prophets of Allah have been opposed and resisted, they have not been
opposed and resisted on the basis of any rational ground but on the
basis of the same obduracy and stubbornness and false pride that is
being shown against the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him), and there is no other motive for it than
rebellion and arrogance. Then the Holy Prophet has been instructed
not to bother about the rebels but to go on performing his mission of
invitation and admonition, for it is useful and beneficial for the
believers although it may not be so for the other people. As for the
wicked people who still persist in their rebellion, they should know
that their predecessors who followed the same way of life, have
already received their shares of the punishment, and these people's
share of the punishment has been made ready for them. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	creatures their shares of the provisions according to Allah's
	command. According to a tradition, Hadrat `Umar explained this very

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>This
	is the thing for which the oath has been sworn. The oath implies
	this: The unique order and regularity with which the wonderful
	system of the rain is functioning before your eyes, and the wisdom
	and good reasons which clearly underlie it, testify to the reality
	that this world is not a meaningless and useless toy-house where the
	great drama of life is being presented at random since millions and
	millions of years. Hut, it is, in fact, a wise system of the highest
	order in which everything that happens has a purpose and reason
	behind it. In this system it is not possible that n creature like
	man should have been given intellect, sense and the powers to
	exploit things to advantage, should have been granted moral sense to
	distinguish the good and evil, right and wrong deeds and then might
	have ban left alone foolishly and meaninglessly in the world to
	behave as he pleased, and that he should never be questioned as to
	how he had used and employed the powers of the heart and mind and
	body, the vast means placed at his disposal w work in the world, and
	the power and authority granted to him to employ the countless
	creatures of God to advantage. In this system of the Universe where
	everything is purposeful, how can the creation of a unique being
	like man only be purposeless? In a system where everything is based
	on wisdom, how can the creation of man only be useless and futile?
	The purpose of the creation of those things which do not possess
	consciousness and intellect is fulfilled in this very physical
	world. Therefore, it would be right and reasonable if they were
	destroyed after they had reached the end of their life term, for
	they have not been granted any powers and authority for which they
	might have to be called to account. But a creature which possesses
	intellect and consciousness and authority, whose activities are not
	confined only to the physical world, but are also moral in nature,
	and whose actions entailing moral consequences do not take place
	only till the end of life, but continue to register their moral
	effects on it even after death, cannot be destroyed like plants and
	animals just after it has fulfilled the function of its physical
	existence. Whatever good or evil act he has committed by his own
	will and choice, he must get the reward 'or suffer the punishment
	for it justly and equitably, for this is the basic requirement of
	the factor under which, contrary to other creatures, he has been
	endowed with the freedom of choice and will. If he is not held
	accountable, if he is not rewarded or punished according to his
	moral acts, and if he also is destroyed at the conclusion of his
	physical life like the creatures which have been given no freedom of
	will and choice, his creation would inevitably be altogether futile,
	and a Wise Being cannot be expected to indulge in a futile exercise.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides,
	there is also another reason for swearing an oath by these four
	phenomena of the Universe regarding the occurrence of the Hereafter
	and the meting out of rewards and punishments. The ground on which
	the deniers of the Hereafter regard the life after death as
	impossible is this: When we are mixed up with dust after death and
	our particles have scattered away in the earth, how can it be
	possible that all these scattered particles of the body are
	reassembled and we are made to rise up again? The error of this
	apprehension is by itself removed when we consider deeply the four
	phenomena of the Universe, which have been presented as an argument
	for the Hereafter. The rays of the sun have their effect on all the
	collections of water on the surface of the earth, where their heat
	reaches. In this process countless drops of water evaporate from the
	collection, but they do not become extinct, and every drop remains
	preserved in the air as vapors. When Allah commands the same wind
	gathers the same vapors of the drops together, combines them into
	thick clouds, spreads those clouds on different parts of the earth
	and precisely at the time appointed by Allah causes each single drop
	to fall back to the earth in the form as it was in the beginning.
	This phenomenon that is occurring before the eyes of man daily
	testifies that the particles of the bodies of the dead men can also
	gather together at one command by Allah and the men can be raised up
	in the shape in which they lived before. Whether these particles are
	in the dust, or in the water, or in the air, in any case they remain
	preserved in this very earth and its atmosphere. Why should it be
	difficult for the God Who gathers together the vapors of water after
	they had dispersed in the air, by means of the same air, and then
	causes them to rain as water, to gather together the scattered
	particles of the human bodies from the air, water and earth and then
	combine them in their original form and shape?

	difference of views because of the similarity. That is, just as the
	clouds and the clusters of stars in the sky have different
	appearances and there is uniformity among them, so are also your
	views about the Hereafter, each different from the other. Some one
	says that this world is eternal and no Resurrection can take place.
	Another say s that this system is not eternal and can come to an end
	in the course of time, but whatever becomes extinct, including man,
	cannot possibly be resurrected. Another one regards resurrection as
	possible but, holds the belief that man in order to be requited for
	his good and evil deeds is born and reborn again and again in this
	very world. Some one believes in Hell and Heaven but combines the
	transmigration of the souls also with it. He thinks that the sinner
	goes to Hell to suffer the punishment as well as is born and reborn
	in this world for the sake of the punishment. Some one says that the
	life in the world is in itself an agony; as long as man's self
	remains attached to physical life, he goes on dying and taking birth
	again and again in this very world, and his real salvation is that
	he should attain annihilation. Some one believes in the Hereafter
	and Hell and Heaven, but says that God by giving death to His only
	son on the cross had atoned for the original sin of man, and man
	will escape the evil consequences of his evil acts by believing in
	the son. Some other people generally believe in the Hereafter and
	the meting out of the rewards and punishments but at the same time
	regard certain holy men as the intercessors, who are such favorites
	of Allah, or wield such influence with Him, that any one who
	attaches himself to them as a disciple, can escape the punishment
	whatever he may do in the world. About these holy men also there is
	no agreement among their devotees; every group of them has its own
	separate intercessor. This difference of the views itself is a proof
	that whenever man has formed an opinion about his own and the
	world's end, independent of Revelation and Prophet hood, he has
	formed it without knowledge; otherwise if man in this regard really
	had some direct means of knowledge there would not have arisen so
	many different and contradictory beliefs.

	the Qur'an is warning man of an important truth. To judge or make an
	estimate on the basis of conjecture and speculation in the ordinary
	matters of worldly life may be useful to some extent, although it
	would be no substitute for knowledge, but it would be disastrous to
	make estimates and give judgments merely according to one's own
	conjectures and speculations in a question of such fundamental
	nature and importance as whether we are, or are not, responsible and
	accountable to anyone for the deeds and actions of our lifetime, and
	if we arc, to whom we are accountable, when and what shall be the
	accountability, and what will be the consequences of our success and
	failure in that accountability. This is not a question on which man
	may form an estimate merely according to his conjecture and
	speculation and then stake his entire life capital on the gamble.
	For if the conjecture proves to be wrong, it would mean that the man
	has doomed himself to utter ruin. Furthermore, this question is not
	at all included among those questions about which one may form a
	right opinion by the exercise of analogy and conjecture, For
	conjecture and analogy can work only in those matters which are
	perceptible for man, whereas this is a question which does not come
	under perception in any way, Therefore, it is not at all possible
	that a conjectural and analogical judgment about it may be right and
	correct. As for the question: What is the right way for man to form
	an opinion about the matters which are no perceptible and

	of the Hereafter is not at all preparing himself for any
	accountability and is engrossed in the thought that there would be
	no life after death, whereas the time would suddenly come when
	against all this expectations he would open his eyes in the new life
	and he would realize that there he has to render an account of each
	of his acts and deeds. The person who is expending his life under
	the idea that he would come back to this very world after death,
	will come to know as soon as he dies that all doors of return are
	closed, that there is no chance of compensating for the misdeeds of
	the previous life by any new actions, and that there is another life
	ahead in which he has to meet with and suffer the consequences of
	his worldly life for ever after. The person who commits suicide in
	the hope that after he has destroyed his self and its desires he
	would escape the agony of life in the form of total annihilation,
	will find as soon as he passes through the gate of death that there
	is an everlasting life ahead and not mortality, where he has to
	explain as to why he had been straining every nerve to destroy the
	self that he had been blessed with instead of developing and
	adorning it in every possible way. Likewise, the one who continued
	committing disobedience of Allah throughout life, placing, reliance
	upon some son of Allah's becoming an atonement or some holy one's
	becoming an intercessor, will come to know as soon as he appears
	before Allah that there is neither any atoner there nor anyone
	wielding such influence and power that he may save him from Allah's

	religious duty on them. But this is the right that a well-.to-do

	after he has paid off the zakat, and he discharges it willingly even
	if it has not been made obligatory by the Shari'ah. lbn 'Abbas,

	misunderstanding that he has become relieved of his duty of
	discharging the right of Allah and His servants that there was in
	his possessions after he has paid the zakat, and now he is not bound

	Contrary to this, every servant of Allah, who is really pious and

	does not let slip any opportunity when he could do some good to the
	people in the world. He is not of the way of thinking that he has
	done whatever good he had been enjoined w do and now no more good is
	required to be done by him. The one who has recognized the true

	from here to the end of verse 46, brief allusions have been made,
	one after the other, to the end of Allah's Prophets and some of the
	nations of the past, which arc meant to impress two things: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that in human history God's law of retribution has been working
	constantly, in which precedents are found of the rewards for the
	righteous and of punishments for the wicked people continuously.
	This is a clear evidence of the fact that even in the life of this
	world the Creator's relationship with man is not merely based on the
	physical law but the moral law also is working side by aide with it.
	And when the temper of the kingdom of the universe is such that the
	creation which has been given an opportunity to act morally while
	living in a physical body, should not only be dealt with on the
	basis of physical laws, like animals and plants, but the moral law
	also should be applied to its moral acts this by . itself points to
	the truth that a time must come in this kingdom when on the
	completion of man's role in the physical world full results of his
	moral acts should also appear strictly in accordance with the moral
	law because in the physical world they do not appear fully. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second thing that has been impressed by these historical allusions
	Is that the nations which did not believe in the Prophets of Allah
	and based thou conduct and attitude in life on the denial of the
	Oneness of Allah, the Prophet hood and the Hereafter, were
	ultimately doomed to destruction. This continuous experience of
	history testifies that God's law of morality that was conveyed
	through the Prophets, and on the basis of which man will be
	subjected to accountability in the Hereafter, is entirely based on
	the truth. For whichever nation determined its conduct and attitude
	in the world independent of this law, considering itself
	irresponsible and un-accountable, has gone straight to its doom. &nbsp;

	Allah rescued the people of that one house and then sent down the
	torment on the land, which did not spare any one of the wicked
	people. In this verse three important themes have been discussed: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	Allah's law of retribution does not decree the total destruction of
	a nation as long as there remains a considerable element of good in
	it. As against the majority of the bad people if it still contains a
	small element of those who continue trying to invite others to the
	right way, Allah gives it an opportunity to work, and goes on
	increasing the respite of the nation which is not yet wholly devoid
	of goodness. But in case theca remains no element of goodness at all
	in the nation, Allah's law is that He somehow rescues by His power
	and grace some of the good people, who might have become weary and
	helpless fighting evil in its settlements, and deals with the rest
	as every sensible master would deal with his rotten fruit. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) That
	&quot;Muslim&quot; is not the name only of the people who arc the
	followers of the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) but
	of all the Prophets before him and their followers who were also
	Muslims. Their religions were not mutually exclusive that one might
	be the religion of the Prophet Abraham, another of the Prophet Moses
	and still another of the Prophet Jesus, but they all were Muslims
	and their religion was this same Islam. This truth has been
	explained at several places in the Qur'an and there is no room for
	ambiguity in this regard. For instance, sec Al Baqarah: 128,
	131-132; Al-'Imran: 67: Al-Ma'idah: 44, 111; Yunus: 72,84; Yusuf:

	the words `Mu 'min &quot; and Muslim &quot; have been used as
	synonyms in this verse. If this verse is read with verse 14 of
	Al-Hujurat, the error of the thinking of those people becomes
	obvious, who regard Mu 'min and Muslim as two independent terms of
	the Qur'an, which have been used in one and the same meaning every
	where, and Muslim is necessarily used for the person who might have
	entered the fold of Islam by professing the Faith only verbally,
	without true faith. (For further explanation, see E. N . 31 of Surah

	sign&quot;: the Dead Sea, southern part of which still presents the
	signs of a great disaster. The archaeologists have expressed the
	opinion that the principal cities of the people of Lot were probably
	sunk underground and the waters of the Dead Sea spread over them.
	For that part of this sea which is situated to the south of the
	small peninsula called &quot;AI-Lisan&quot; clearly seems to be a
	later development, and the signs of the ruins of the Dead Sea found
	to the north of this peninsula are very different from those found
	in the south. From this it is concluded that the southern part was
	once higher than the sea level. At some later time it sank and went
	under water. The period of its sinking also seems to be about 2000
	B.C. and the same precisely is the time of the Prophets Abraham and
	Lot historically. In 1965 an American archaeological research party
	discovered a large grave-yard at Al-Lisan which contains more than
	twenty thousand graves. From this one is led to think that nearby it
	there must have existed a large city. But no ruins of any such city
	are found in the adjoining area, which might have given rise to such
	a big grave-yard. This fact also strengthens the doubt that the city
	whose grave-yard it was has sunk under the sea. The area to the
	south of the sea still abounds in the ruins and the underground
	stocks of sulfur, resin, tar and natural gas found in this area lead
	one to believe that hell must have been let loose at this place at
	Borne time by the eruption of lava and the play of lightning. (For
	further explanation, see E.N. 114 of Ash-Shu'ara').

	duty; if the other man is not convinced, let hire alone. If the
	preacher does not any more attend to him, he cannot be blamed for
	letting a person remain involved in error, because now the other
	person himself is responsible for his deviation and error. &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote52sym" HREF="#sdfootnote52anc">52</A>The
	Holy Prophet has not been addressed here to be taught this method
	because, God forbid, in his preaching he unnecessarily pursued the
	people and Allah wanted to stop him from this fact, the actual
	reason for stating this method is that when a preacher of the truth
	has done his best to make the people understand his message in a
	rational way and then seeing the signs of stubbornness in them
	withdraws from them, the people inveigh against him and start
	accusing him of indifference and inattention whereas, they, as they
	say, want to discuss things in order to understand his message. The
	fact, however, is that they do not intend to understand anything but
	only to involve the preacher in disputation and waste his time.
	Therefore, Allah Himself said in clear words: &quot;Turn away from
	them: you are not at all to blame for showing any indifference
	towards them.&quot; After this nobody could blame the Holy Prophet
	that according to the Book that he had brought he had been appointed
	to make them understand his religion: then why he did not answer
	their objections.

<DIV ID="sdfootnote53">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote53sym" HREF="#sdfootnote53anc">53</A>That
	is, &quot;I have not created them for the service of others but for
	My own service. They should serve Me, for I am their Creator. When
	no one else has created them, no one else has the right that they
	should serve him; and how can it be admissible for them that they
	should serve others instead of Me, their Creator?&quot; Here, the
	question arises that Allah Almighty is not the Creator only of the
	jinn and men but of the entire Universe and of every thing in it.
	Then, why has it been said only about the jinn and men that He has
	not created them for the service of others but of Himself ? whereas
	every single creature is there to serve Allah. The answer is: On the
	earth only the jinn and men have been granted the freedom that they
	may serve Allah within their sphere of choice if they so like;
	otherwise they can turn away from Allah's service as well as serve
	others beside Hun. The rest of the creatures in the world do not
	have this kind of freedom. They do not have any choice whatever that
	they may not worship and serve Allah, or may serve any other.
	Therefore, only about the jinn and men it has been said here that by
	turning away from the obedience and servitude of their Creator
	within the bounds of their option and choice and by serving others
	than the Creator, they are fighting their own nature. They should
	know that they have not been created for the service of any other
	but the Creator, and for them the right way is that they should not
	abuse the freedom granted them, but within the bounds of this
	freedom also they should serve God voluntarily just as every
	particle of their body is serving Him involuntarily in the sphere
	where they have not been granted any freedom, 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The word
	`ibadat (service, worship) in this verse has not been used in the
	sense of only prayer, fasting and other kinds of such worship so
	that one may understand that the jinn and men have been created only
	for performing the Prayer, observing the Fast and for praising and
	glorifying Allah. Although this sense also is included in it, this
	is not its complete sense. Its complete sense is that the jinn and
	men have not been created for the worship, obedience and carrying
	out of the orders of any other but Allah. They are not there to bow
	to any other, to carry out the orders of any other, to live in fear
	of any other, to follow the religion enjoined by any other, to look
	upon any other as the maker and destroyer of ones destiny, and to
	supplicate any other than Allah for help. (For further explanation,
	see E.N. 63 of Surah Saba, E.N. 2 of Az-Zumar, E.N. 30 of A1
	Jathiyah). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	thing that incidentally becomes quilt obvious from this verse is
	that the jinn arc a separate and independent creation from men. This
	brings out the error of the thinking of those people, who assert
	that sonic people from among mankind have been called the jinn in
	the Qur'an. This same thing is also confirmed and testified by the
	following verses of the Qur'an: AI-An'am :100, 128, AI-A`raf, 38,
	179, Hud: 119, AI-Hijr: 27 to 33, Bani Isra`il: 88, AI-Kahf: S0,
	As-Sajdah: 13, Saba: 41, Suad: 75, 76, Ha Mim As-Sajdah: 25,
	AI-Ahqaf: 18, Ar-Rahman: 15, 39, 56. (For a complete discussion of
	this question, see E. N . 21 of AI-Anbiya', E.N.'s 23, 45 of
	An-Naml, E.N. 24 of Saba). &nbsp;

	I indeed do not stand in need of their service, but it is the demand

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And in

	indeed, stand in need of these their worshipers. If they do not help
	sustain their godhead, it would not function even for a day. The
	gods do not provide for the worshipers but the worshipers provide
	for the gods instead. The gods do not feed them but they feed the

	protect the gods instead. The worshipers, in fact, are their army
