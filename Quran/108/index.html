az-Zubair and Hadrat Aishah as saying that this Surah is Makki. Kalbi
and Muqatil also regard it as Makki, and the same is the view held by
the majority of commentators. But Hadrat Hasan Basri, Ikrimah,
Mujahid and Qatadah regard it as Madani. Imam Suyuti in </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Al-Itqan</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">of Muslim has also preferred the same.
The reason for this assumption is the tradition which traditionists
of the rank of Imam Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Daud, Nasai, Ibn Abi Shaibah,
Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Marduyah, Baihaqi and others have related from
Hadrat Anas bin Malik, saying: &quot;The Holy Prophet was among us.
In the meantime he dozed; then he raised his head, smiling, according
to some traditions, the people asked what for he was smiling,
according to others, he himself told them that a Surah had just been
revealed to him. Then, with </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Bismillah
ir-Rahman ir-Rahim</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
he recited Surah Al-Kauthar; then he asked the people whether they
knew what Kauthar was. When they said that Allah and his Messenger
had the best knowledge, he said; It is a river which my Lord has
granted me in Paradise.&quot; (The details follow under &quot;</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Kauthar</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;).
The basis of the reasoning from this tradition for this Surah's being
Madani is that Hadrat Anas belonged to Madinah, and his saying that
this Surah was revealed in his presence is a proof that it was
Madani. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">the Holy Prophet had not only been
informed of this gift of Allah Almighty but also shown it, there was
no reason why Surah Al-Kauthar should have be revealed at Madinah to
give him the good news of it. Thirdly, if in an assembly of the
Companions the Holy Prophet himself had given the news of the
revelation of Surah Al-Kauthar which Hadrat Anas has mentioned in his
tradition, and it meant that that Surah had been revealed for the
first time then, it was not possible that well-informed Companions
like Hadrat Aishah, Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas and Hadrat Abdullah bin
Zubair should have declared this Surah to be a Makki revelation and
most of the commentators also should have regarded it as Makki. If
the matter is considered carefully, there appears to be a flaw in the
tradition from Hadrat Anas in that it does not say what was the
subject under discussion in the assembly in which the Holy Prophet
gave the news about Surah Al-Kauthar. It is possible that at that
time the Holy Prophet was explaining something. In the meantime he
was informed by revelation that that point was further explained by
Surah Al-Kauthar, and he mentioned the same thing, saying that that
Surah was revealed to him just then. Such incidents did take place on
several occasions, on the basis of which the commentators have opined
about certain verses that they were revealed twice. This second
revelation, in fact, meant that the verse had been revealed earlier,
but on some later occasion the Holy Prophet's attention was invited
to it by revelation for the second time. In such traditions, the
mention of the revelation of a certain verse is not enough to decide
whether it was revealed at Makkah or Madinah, and when precisely it
was revealed. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Had
this tradition of Hadrat Anas not been there to cause doubt, the

it was revealed at Makkah, and in the period when the Holy Prophet

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before
this in Surahs Ad-Duha and Alam Nashrah we have seen that when in the
earliest phase of Prophethood the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
was passing through the most trying conditions when the whole nation
had turned hostile, there was resistance and opposition on every
side, and the Holy Prophet and a handful of his Companions did not
see any remote chance of success. Allah in order to console and
encourage him at that time had sent down several verses. In Surah Ad-
Duha it was said: &quot;And surely the later period (i.e. every later
period) is better for you than the former period, and soon your Lord
shall give you so much that you shall be well pleased&quot;. In Surah
Alam Nashrah: &quot;And We exalted your renown for you.&quot;That is,
&quot;Though the enemies are trying to defame you throughout the
country, We, on the contrary, have arranged to exalt your name and
fame.&quot;And: &quot;The fact is that along with every hardship
there is also ease.&quot;That is, &quot;You should not be
disheartened by the severity of conditions at this time; this period
of hardships will soon pass, and the period of success and victory
will follow.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Such
were the conditions in which Allah by sending down Surah Al-Kauthar
consoled the Holy Prophet as well as foretold the destruction of his
opponents. The disbelieving Quraish said: &quot;Muhammad (upon whom
be Allah's peace) is cut off from his community and reduced to a
powerless and helpless individual. According to Ikrimah when the Holy
Prophet was appointed a Prophet, and he began to call the people to
Islam, the Quraish said: &quot;Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace
and blessings) is cut off from his people as a tree is cut off from
its root, which might fall to the ground any moment.&quot; (Ibn
Jarir). Muhammad bin Ishaq says: &quot;Whenever the Prophet (upon
whom be peace) was mentioned before As bin Wa'il as-Sehmi, the chief
of Makkah, he used to say: Let him alone for he is only a childless
man (</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">abtar</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">)
with no male offspring. When he dies, there will be no one to
remember him.&quot; Shamir bin Atiyyah says that Uqbah bin Abi
Mu'ait, also used to say similar things about the Holy Prophet, (Ibn
Jarir). According to Ibn Abbas, once Ka'b bin Ashraf (the Jewish
chief of Madinah) came to Makkah and the Quraish chiefs said to him:
&quot;Just see this boy, who is cut off from his people; he thinks he
is superior to us, whereas we manage the Hajj, look after the Ka'bah
and water the pilgrims.&quot; (Bazzar). Concerning this very incident
Ikrimah reports that the Quraish had used the words </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">as-sunbur

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">(a weak, helpless and childless man
who is cut off from his people) for the Holy Prophet. (Ibn Jarir) Ibn
Sa'd and lbn Asakir have related that Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas said;
&quot;The eldest son of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was
Qasim; next to him was Zainab, next to her Hadrat Abdullah and next
to him three daughters, viz. Umm Kulthum, Fatimah and Ruqayyah. Of
them first Hadrat Qasim died and then Hadrat Abdullah. Thereupon As
bin Wail said: &quot;His line has come to an end: now he is </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">abtar</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">(i. e. cut of from root).&quot;Some
traditions add that As said &quot;Muhammad is </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">abtar</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">:
he has no son to succeed him. When he dies, his memory will perish
and you will be rid of him.&quot;The tradition from Ibn Abbas, which
Abd bin Humaid has related, shows that Abu Jahl also had said similar
words on the death of the Holy Prophet's son, Abdullah. Ibn Abi Hatim
has related on the authority of Shmir bin Atiyyah that the same kind
of meanness was shown by Uqbah bin Abi Mu'ait by rejoicing at this
bereavement of the Holy Prophet. Ata says that when the second son of
the Holy Prophet died, his own uncle, Abu Lahab (whose house was next
to his) hastened to the pagans and gave them the &quot;good news&quot;:

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Such
were the disturbing conditions under which Surah Al-Kauthar was sent
down. The Quraish were angry with him because he worshiped and served
only Allah and repudiated their idolatry publicly. For this very
reason he was deprived of the rank, esteem and honor that he enjoyed
among his people before Prophethood and was now as cut off from his
community. The handful of his Companions also were helpless, poor
people who were being persecuted and tyrannized. Furthermore, he was
bereaved by the death of two sons, one after the other, whereat the
near relatives and the people of his clan, brotherhood and
neighborhood were rejoicing and uttering such words as were
disheartening and disturbing for a noble person who had treated even
his enemies most kindly. At this Allah just in one sentence of this
brief Surah gave him the good news, better news than which has never
been given to any man in the world, besides the decision that it will
be his opponents who will be cut off from their root and not he. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	full meaning of the word kauthar, as used here, cannot perhaps be
	expressed in one word in any language of the world. This is an
	intensive form of the noun kathrat which literally means abundance,
	but the context in which it has been used does not give the meaning
	of mere abundance but abundance of good, of spiritual benefits and
	blessings, and of such abundance which is unbounded and limitless,
	and it does not imply any one good or benefit or blessing but
	abundance of countless benefits and blessings.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Have
	a look again at the background of this Surah given in the
	Introduction. The enemies thought that Muhammad (upon whom be
	Allah's peace and blessings) had been completely ruined: he was cut
	off from the community and had become utterly helpless and
	powerless; his trade was ruined; his male children who could
	perpetuate his name were dead; the message that he presented was
	such that except for a handful of the people no one in entire
	Arabia, not to speak of Makkah, was prepared to listen to it
	therefore, failure and disappointment would be his lot as long as he
	lived and there would be no one in posterity to remember him when he
	died. Under such conditions when Allah said: &quot;We have granted
	you the Kauthar,&quot; it by itself gave the meaning: Your foolish
	opponents think that you are ruined and deprived of the good things
	that you enjoyed before Prophethood, but the fact is that We have
	favored you with unbounded good and countless blessings.&quot; This
	included the matchless moral qualities which the Holy Prophet was
	blessed with; this included the great blessings of Prophethood and
	the Qur'an, the knowledge and wisdom that were granted to him; this
	included the blessing of Tauhid and also of such a system of life,
	whose simple and intelligible, rational and natural, and
	comprehensive principles had the potential to spread throughout the
	world and of continuing to spread for ever afterwards. This also
	included the blessing of the exaltation of renown because of which
	the holy Prophet's blessed name continues to be exalted throughout
	the world since 1400 years and will continue to be so exalted till
	Resurrection. </FONT></FONT>

	standard-bearer of Truth in the world for ever, which can claim to
	have produced the greatest number of the pious, virtuous and noble
	charactered men in any one nation, and which even when corrupted and
	deprived has the highest good in it as against every other nation of
	the world. This also included the blessing that the Holy Prophet
	during his very lifetime witnessed his invitation and message
	attaining to the highest success and the preparation of a community
	which had the power to dominate the world. This also included the
	blessing that although on his being deprived of the male offspring
	the enemies thought he would be lost to posterity, yet Allah not
	only blessed him with the spiritual offspring in the form of
	Muslims, who will continue to exalt his name in the world till
	Resurrection but also granted him from his one daughter, Hadrat
	Fatimah, the natural progeny, who have spread throughout world and

	addition, Kauthar also implies two other great blessings which Allah
	will bestow on him in the Hereafter. We had no means of knowing
	these; therefore the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) himself gave
	us news of them, and told us that Kauthar also implied them. First,
	the Fountain of Kauthar, which he will be granted on the
	Resurrection Day in the Plain of Assembly; second, the River
	Kauthar, which he will be granted in Paradise. About both such a

	will extend from Aylah (the present Israeli seaport of Ilat) to

	Concerning it the Holy Prophet warned the people of his time again

	effect changes in my Way, will be removed from the Fountain and will
	be disallowed to approach it. I shall say: they are my companions,
	but it will be said: &quot;Don't you know what they did after you?

	Majah: Kitab al-Manasik. The Hadith which Ibn Majah has related in
	this connection contains very pathetic words. The Holy Prophet said:
	&quot;Beware! I shall have arrived at the Fountain before you and
	shall pride myself by your means upon the greater numbers of my
	Ummah as against other ummahas Do not at that time cause my face to
	be blackened. Beware: I shall have some people released, and some
	people shall be separated from me. I shall say: O my Lord, they are
	my companions. He will reply: Don't you know what innovations they
	introduced after you?&quot; According to Ibn Majah, these words were
	said by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) in his Sermon at

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>Different
	commentaries of it have been reported from different scholars. Some
	of them take the Prayer to mean the five times obligatory Prayer
	(salat); some take it to imply the Prayer of `Id al-Adha, and some
	say that it implies the Prayer itself. Likewise, the meaning of
	wanhar and sacrifice according to some illustrious scholars, is to
	place the right hand over the left hand and to fold them on the
	chest in the Prayer; some say that it implies raising both hands
	with Allahu Akbar at the commencement of the Prayer; some say that
	it implies raising both hands at the commencement of the Prayer, at
	bowing for Ruku ` and after rising from Ruku `; and some say that it
	means performing the `Id al-Adha Prayer and then offering the animal
	sacrifice. But if the context in which this command has been
	enjoined, is considered, its meaning clearly seems to be: &quot;O
	Prophet, when your Lord has granted you so many and so splendid
	blessing, then you should perform the Prayer only for His sake and
	offer sacrifice only for His sake.&quot; This Command was given in
	the environment when not only the pagans of Quraish but the pagans
	of entire Arabia and the world worshiped their self-made gods and
	offered sacrifices at their shrines. Therefore, the intention of the
	Command is &quot;Contrary to the polytheistic practice, you should
	remain steadfast to your creed: your Prayer is only for Allah and
	your sacrifice also is for Him alone, as it has been said at another
	place: `Declare, O Prophet, my salat and my sacrifice and my life
	and my death are all for Allah, Lord of the universe, Who has no
	partner with Him. This is what I have been enjoined, and I am the
	first to surrender to Him.'(Al-An`am:162-163). This same meaning has
	been explained of it by Ibn 'Abbas. `Ata`, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Hasan
	Bari, Qatadah, Muhammad bin Ka`b al-Kurzi, Dahhak, Rabi` bin Anas,
	`Ata` al-Khurasani and many other major commentators (may Allah
	bless them all) (Ibn Jarir). However, this by itself is correct that
	when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) enforced by Allah's
	command the practice of the `Id al-Adha Prayer and the offering of
	animal sacrifice at Madinah, he himself gave the first place to the
	Prayer (salat and the second to the sacrifice, as commanded in the
	verses: Inna salati wa nusuki and fa-salli li-Rabbika wanhar, and
	enjoined an the Muslims also to do the same, i.e. they should first
	perform the Prayer and then offer the sacrifice. This is neither the
	explanation of this verse nor the occasion of its revelation but a
	deduction made by the Holy Prophet from these verses and his
	deduction of injunctions also is a kind of Divine inspiration.&nbsp;

	abtar: &quot;He himself is abtar&quot;, i.e. though he calls you
	abtar he in fact himself is abtar. Some explanations of abtar have
	already been given in the Introduction to the Surah. It is derived
	from batar which means to cut off, but idiomatically it is used in a
	comprehensive meaning. In the Hadith, the rak ah of the Prayer which
	is not coupled with another rak'ah is called butaira', i.e. the
	lonely rak ah. According to another Hadith &quot;Every piece of
	work, which is in any way important, is abtar if it is started
	without the glorification and praise of Allah&quot;, implying that
	it is cut off from the root, It has no stability, and it is doomed
	to failure. A man who fails to achieve his object is abtar as also
	the one who is deprived of all means and resources. A person who is
	left with no hope of any good and success in life is also abtar. A
	person who has been cut off from his family, brotherhood, associates
	And helpers is also abtar. The word abtar is also used for the man
	who has no male child, or whose male child or children have died,
	for after him there remains no one to remember him and he is lost to
	posterity . after death. In almost all these meanings the
	disbelieving Quraish called the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	abtar. At this, Allah said: &quot;O Prophet, not you but your
	enemies are abtar.&quot; This was not merely a &quot;reprisal&quot;,
	but a prophecy out of the most important prophecies of the Qur'an,
	which literally proved true. when it was made, the people regarded
	the Holy Prophet as abtar, and no one could imagine how the big
	chiefs of the Quraish would become abtar, who were famous not only
	in Makkah but throughout Arabia, who were successful in life, rich
	in worldly wealth and children, who had their associates and helpers
	everywhere in the country, who enjoyed intimate relations with all
	the Arabian tribes, being monopolists in trade and managers of Hajj.
	But not long afterwards the conditions altogether changed. There was
	a time when on the occasion of the Battle of the Trench (A.H. 5) the
	Quraish had invaded Madinah with the help of many Arabian and Jewish
	tribes, and the Holy Prophet being besieged had to resist the enemy
	by digging a trench around the city. After only three years, in A.H.
	8, when he attacked Makkah, the Quraish had no helper and they had
	to surrender helplessly. After this within a year or so the whole
	Arabia came under his control, deputations of tribes from all over
	the country began to visit him to take the oaths of allegiance and
	his enemies were left utterly helpless and resourceless. Then they
	were so lost to posterity that even if their children survived, none
	of them today knows that he is a descendant of Abu Jahl, Abu Lahab,
	As bin Wail, or `Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ait, the enemies of Islam, and
	even if he knows it, he is not prepared to claim that his ancestors
	were those people. On the contrary, blessings are being invoked on
	the children of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) throughout the
	world; millions and millions of Muslims take pride in bearing
	relationship to him; hundreds of thousands of people regard it as a
	mark of honor and prestige to have descended not only from him but
	from his family and even the families of his Companions. Thus, some
	one is a Sayyid, another an 'Alavi, and `Abbasi, a Hashmi, a
	Siddiqi, a Faruqi, an `Uthmani, a Zubairi, or an Ansari, but no one
	is an Abu Jahli or Abu Lahabi. History has proved that not the Holy
	Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) but his
	enemies were, and are, abtar.&nbsp; &quot;
