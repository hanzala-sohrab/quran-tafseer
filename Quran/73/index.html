two sections of this Surah were revealed in two separate periods. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The

As for the question, in which specific period of the life at Makkah
it was revealed, it is not answered by the tradition, but the
internal evidence of the subject matter of this section helps to
determine the period of its revelation. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First,
in it the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been instructed to
the effect: &quot;Arise during the night and worship Allah so that
you may develop the capability to shoulder the heavy burden of
Prophethood and to discharge its responsibilities.&quot; This shows
that this Command must have been given in the earliest period of the
Prophethood when training was being imparted to the Holy prophet by
Allah for this office. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Secondly,
a Command has been given in it that the Qur'an be recited in, the
Tahajjud Prayer for half the night, or thereabout. This Command by
itself points out that by that time at least so much of the Qur'an
had been revealed as could be recited for that long. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thirdly,
in this section the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been
exhorted to have patience at the excesses being committed by his
opponents, and the disbelievers of Makkah have been threatened with
the torment. This shows that this section was revealed at a time when
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had openly started preaching
Islam and the opposition to him at Makkah had grown active and
strong. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

the second section (v. 20) although many of the commentators have
expressed the opinion that this too was sent down at Makkah, yet some
other commentators regard it as a Madani Revelation, and this same
opinion is confirmed by the subject matter of this section. For it
mentions fighting in the way of Allah, and obviously, there could be
no question of it at Makkah; it also contains the Command to pay the
obligatory </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">zakat</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the first seven verses the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been
commanded to the effect: &quot;Prepare yourself to shoulder the
responsibilities of the great Mission that has been entrusted to you;
its practical form is that you should rise during the hours of night
and stand up in Prayer for half the night, or for a little more or
less of it.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 8-14, he has been exhorted to the effect: &quot;Devote yourself
exclusively to that God Who is the Owner of the whole universe.
Entrust all your affairs to Him with full satisfaction of the heart.
Bear with patience whatever your opponents may utter against you. Do
not be intimate with them. Leave their affair to God: He Himself will
deal with them.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
in vv. 15-19, those of the people of Makkah, who were opposing the
Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) have been warned, so as to say: &quot;We
have sent a Messenger to you just as We sent a Messenger to the
Pharaoh. Just consider what fate the Pharaoh met when he did not
accept the invitation of the Messenger of Allah. Supposing that you
are not punished by a torment in this world, how will you save
yourselves from the punishment for disbelief on the Day of
Resurrection.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">This
is the subject matter of the first section. The second section,
according to a tradition from Hadrat Sa'id bin Jubair, was sent down
ten years later, and in it the initial Command given in connection
with the Tahajjud Prayer, in the beginning of the first section, was
curtailed. The new Command enjoined, &quot;Offer as much of the
Tahajjud Prayer as you easily can, but what the Muslims should
particularly mind and attend to is the five times obligatory Prayer a
day:, they should establish it regularly and punctually; they should
discharge their </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">zakat</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">dues accurately; and they should spend
their wealth with sincere intentions for the sake of Allah. In
conclusion, the Muslims have been exhorted, saying: &quot;Whatever
good works you do in the world, will not go waste, but they are like
the provision which a traveler sends up in advance to his permanent
place of residence. Whatever good you send up from the world, you
will find it with Allah, and the provision thus sent up is much
better than what you will have to leave behind in the world, and with
Allah you will also get a much better and richer reward than what you
have actually sent up before.&quot;</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

	with &quot;O you who sleeps covered up&quot; instead of with &quot;O

	itself gives the meaning: &quot;Gone is the time when you used to

	the Qur'an ......&quot;: Do not recite it quickly and in haste, but
	slowly and distinctly: pause at every verse so that the mind
	understands the meaning and purport of Divine Revelation well and
	takes effect from it. if it contains the mention of Allah's Being
	and Attributes, it may awe-inspire the heart with His glory and
	majesty; if it expresses His mercy, the heart may be filled with
	feelings of gratitude to Him; if it mentions His wrath and His
	punishment, the heart may be overwhelmed by fear of Him; if it
	enjoins something or forbids something, one may understand what has
	been enjoined and what has been forbidden. In short, the recital
	does not only consist in uttering the words with the tongue, but it
	should involve thoughtful consideration of the meaning. When Hadrat
	Anas was asked about the Holy Prophet's method of reciting the
	Qur'an, he replied: The Holy Messenger stretched the words when
	reciting them. For example, when he recited Bismillah ir-Rahman
	it-Rahim he would stretch and prolong the sound of Allah, Rahman and
	Rahim (Bukhari). When Hadrat Umm Salamah was asked the same
	question, she replied that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	recited every verse separately and distinctly and observed a pause
	at the end of every verse. For instance, he recited
	AI-hamdu-lillah-i Rabb-il'alamin, and paused, then recited ar-Rahman
	ir-Rahim, and paused, and then recited Malik-i yaum id-di'n.
	&quot;(Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi). In another tradition,
	Hadrat Umm Salamah has stated that the Holy Prophet recited each
	word distinctly and clearly. (Tirmidhi, Nasa'i). Hadrat Hudhaifah
	bin Yaman says: &quot;Once I stood beside the Holy Prophet in the
	Night Prayer to see how he recited the Qur'an. I noticed that he
	glorified Allah where He should be glorified, invoked and
	supplicated Allah where He should be invoked and supplicated, and
	sought refuge of Allah where His refuge should be sought.&quot;
	(Muslim, Nasa'i). Hadrat Abu Dharr has stated that once during the
	Night Prayer when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) came to the
	sentence: In to adhdhib-hmn ... (If You punish them, then they are
	Your servants; and if You forgive them, then You are Almighty,
	All-Wise), he went on repeating it over and over again until it
	became dawn.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Bukhari).&nbsp;

	it cannot be explained in any one sentence. Its one meaning is: As
	the rising for worship by night and standing up for a long tithe in
	the Prayer is against human nature and the self of man seeks ease
	and comfort at that time. this act is an exercise which is most
	effective in controlling and disciplining the self. The person who

	efficiently and firmly to make the message of true Faith prevail in

	producing harmony and concord between the heart and the tongue, for
	during these hours of the night none else intervenes between the
	servant and his God, and whatever man utters with his tongue in this
	state, is the very voice of his heart. The third meaning is: This is
	a very efficacious means of bringing about conformity between the
	exterior and the interior of man, , for the person who in the
	solitude of the night would abandon his comfort and ease and arise
	for worship, would do so only out of sincerity: there can be no

	develops steadfastness in him: he is enabled to walk in the path of
	God more firmly and can face and endure the hardships of that way

	this verse in which reduction has been made in the injunction
	concerning the Tahajjud Prayer, there are different traditions.
	Musnad Ahmad, Muslim and Abu Da'ud have related a tradition, on the
	authority of Hadrat `A'ishah, saying that this second command was
	sent down one year after the first command, and the standing up in
	the Prayer at night was made voluntary instead of obligatory.
	Another tradition which Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim have related,
	again on the authority of Hadrat `A'ishah, says that this command
	came down 8 months after the first command, and a third tradition
	which Ibn Abi Hatim has related again from her, says that it came
	down 16 months later. Abu Da'ud, Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim have
	cited the period of one year from Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Abbas. But
	Hadrat Sa'id bin Jubair has stated that it was sent down ten years
	later. (Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim). In our opinion this last view is
	most sound, for the subject-matter of the first section clearly
	shows that it was sent down in Makkah and that too in the earliest
	stage when at the most four years might have passed since the advent
	of Prophethood. Contrary to this, this second section, .in view of
	the express evidence of its subject matter, seems to have been
	revealed at Madinah when fighting had started with the disbelievers
	and the zakat also had been enjoined as an obligatory duty. On this
	basis inevitably the two sections should have been sent down at an
	interval of at least ten years between them.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote21sym" HREF="#sdfootnote21anc">21</A>As
	the Prayer is prolonged due mainly to a lengthy recital of the
	Qur'an, it is said: &quot;You may recite as much of the Qur'an as
	you easily can in the Tahajjud Prayer This would automatically cause
	the Prayer to be shortened&quot; . Although the words here are
	apparently in the imperative mood, it is agreed by all that Tahajjud
	is not an obligatory but a voluntary Prayer. In the Hadith also it
	has been explained that on an inquiry by a person the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) replied: &quot;Five times Prayer in the day and
	night is obligatory on you. He asked: Is anything besides this also
	binding on me? The Holy Prophet said: No, unless you may like to

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This

	recital of the Qur'an. For just as Allah at other places has used
	the words ruku' and sajdah for the prayer, so here He has mentioned
	recital of the Qur'an, which implies its recital in the Prayer. If
	somebody objects to this conclusion, saying: When the Tahajjud
	Prayer itself is voluntary, how can recital of the Qur'an in it be
	obligatory? The answer is: Even in case of the voluntary Prayer it
	is incumbent on one to fulfil all the pre-requisites of the Prayer
	and to perform all its basic elements and obligatory parts. No one
	can say that in case of the voluntary Prayer, purity of the garments
	and body, ablutions and concealment of the satar (minimal part of
	the body to be covered) are not obligatory, and the standing up and
