<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">in verse thereby implying that it is
the Surah in which the word </FONT><EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">al-hashr</FONT></EM>

a tradition from Hadrat Sa'id bin Jubair to the effect &quot;When I
asked Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas about Surah Al-Hashr, he replied that
it was sent down concerning the battle against the Bani an-Nadir just
as Surah Al-Anfal was sent down concerning the Battle of Badr. In
another tradition from Hadrat Sa'id bin Jubair, the words cited from
Ibn Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) are: </FONT><EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Qul:
Surah an-Nadir</FONT></EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">: Say, it is
Surah an-Nadir.&quot; The same thing has been related also from
Mujahid, Qatadah, Zuhri, Ibn Zaid, Yazid bin Ruman, Muhammad bin
Ishaq and others. They are unanimous that the followers of the Book
whose banishment has been mentioned in it, imply the Bani an-Nadir.
Yazid bin Ruman, Mujahid and Muhammad bin Ishaq have stated that this
whole Surah, from beginning to end, came down concerning this very
battle. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As for the question as
to when this battle took place, Imam Zuhri has stated on the
authority of Urwah bin Zubair that it took place six months after the
Battle of Badr. However, Ibn Sa'd, Ibn Hisham and Baladhuri regard it
as an event of Rabi' al-Awwal, A. H. 4, and the same is correct. For
all traditions agree that this battle took place after the incident
of Bi'r Ma'unah, and historically also it is well known that the
incident of Bir Ma'unah occurred after the Battle of Uhud and not
before it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Historical Background</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In order to understand
the subject matter of this Surah well, it is necessary to have a look
at the history of the Madinah and Hejaz Jews, for without it one
cannot know precisely the real causes of the Holy Prophet's dealing
with their different tribes the way he did. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>No authentic history
of the Arabian Jews exists in the world. They have not left any
writing of their own in the form of a book or a tablet which might
throw light on their past, nor have the Jewish historians and writers
of the non-Arab world made any mention of them, the reason being that
after their settlement in the Arabian peninsula they had detached
themselves from the main body of the nation, and the Jews of the
world did not count them as among themselves. For they had given up
Hebrew culture and language, even the names, and adopted Arabism
instead. In the tablets that have been unearthed in the
archaeological research in the Hejaz no trace of the Jews is found
before the first century of the Christian era, except for a few
Jewish names. Therefore, the history of the Arabian Jews is based
mostly on the verbal traditions prevalent among the Arabs most of
which bad been spread by the Jews themselves. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The Jews of the Hejaz claimed that
they had come to settle in Arabia during the last stage of the life
of the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him). They said that the Prophet
Moses had dispatched an army to expel the Amalekites from the land of
Yathrib and had commanded it not to spare even a single soul of that
tribe. The Israelite army carried out the Prophet's command, but
spared the life of a handsome prince of the Amalekite king and
returned with him to Palestine. By that time the Prophet Moses had
passed sway. His successors took great exception to what the army had
done, for by sparing the life of an Amalekite it had clearly
disobeyed the Prophet and violated the Mosaic law. Consequently, they
excluded the army from their community, and it had to return to
Yathrib and settle there for ever.(</FONT><EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Kitab
al-Aghani</FONT></EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">, vol. xix, p.
94). Thus the Jews claimed that they had been living in Yathrib since
about 1200 B.C. But, this had in fact no historical basis and
probably the Jews had invented this story in order to overawe the
Arabs into believing that they were of noble lineage and the original
inhabitants of the land. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The second Jewish immigration,
according to the Jews, took, place in 587 BC. when Nebuchadnezzer,
the king of Babylon, destroyed Jerusalem and dispersed the Jews
throughout the world. The Arab Jews said that several of their tribes
at that time had come to settle in Wadi al-Qura, Taima, and
Yathrib.(Al-Baladhuri, </FONT><EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Futuh
al-Buldan</FONT></EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">). But this too
has no historical basis. By this also they might have wanted to prove
that they were the original settlers of the area. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As a matter of fact,
what is established is that when in A. D. 70 the Romans massacred the
Jews in Palestine, and then in A. D. 132 expelled them from that
land, many of the Jewish tribes fled to find an asylum in the Hejaz,
a territory that was contiguous to Palestine in the south. There,
they settled wherever they found water springs and greenery, and then
by intrigue and through money lending business gradually occupied the
fertile lands. Ailah, Maqna, Tabuk, Taima, Wadi al Qura, Fadak and
Khaiber came under their control in that very period, and Bani
Quraizah, Bani al-Nadir, Bani Bahdal, and Bani Qainuqa also came in
the same period and occupied Yathrib. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Among the tribes that
settled in Yathrib the Bani al Nadir and the Bani Quraizah were more
prominent for they belonged to the Cohen or priest class. They were
looked upon as of noble descent and enjoyed religious leadership
among their co- religionists. When they came to settle in Madinah
there were some other tribes living there before, whom they subdued
and became practically the owners of this green and fertile land.
About three centuries later, in A. D. 450 or 451, the great flood of
Yemen occurred which has been mentioned in vv. 16-17 of Surah Saba
above. As a result of this different tribes of the people of Saba
were compelled to leave Yemen and disperse in different parts of
Arabia. Thus, the Bani Ghassan went to settle in Syria, Bani Lakhm in
Hirah (Iraq), Bani Khuzaah between Jeddah and Makkah and the Aus and
the Khazraj went to settle in Yathrib. As Yathrib was under Jewish
domination, they at first did not allow the Aus and the Khazraj to
gain a footing and the two Arab tribes had to settle on lands that
had not yet been brought under cultivation, where they could hardly
produce just enough to enable them to survive. At last, one of their
chiefs went to Syria to ask for the assistance of their Ghassanide
brothers; he brought an army from there and broke the power of the
Jews. Thus, the Aus and the Khazraj were able to gain complete
dominance over Yathrib, with the result that two of the major Jewish
tribes, Bani an-Nadir and Bani Quraizaha were forced to take quarters
outside the city. Since the third tribe, Bani Qainuqa, was not on
friendly terms with the other two tribes, it stayed inside the city
as usual, but had to seek protection of the Khazraj tribe. As a
counter measure to this Bani an Nadir and Bani Quraizah took
protection of the Aus tribe so that they could live in peace in the
suburbs of Yathrib. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before the Holy
Prophet's arrival at Madinah until his emigration the following were
the main features of the Jews position in Hejaz in general and in
Yathrib in particular: </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In the matter of
	language, dress, civilization and way of life they had completely
	adopted Arabism, even their names had become Arabian. Of the 12
	Jewish tribes that had settled in Hejaz, none except the Bani Zaura
	retained its Hebrew name. Except for a few scattered scholars none
	knew Hebrew. In fact, there is nothing in the poetry of the Jewish
	poets of the pre-Islamic days to distinguish it from the poetry of
	the Arab poets in language, ideas and themes. They even
	inter-married with the Arabs. In fact, nothing distinguished them
	from the common Arabs except religion. Notwithstanding this, they
	had not lost their identity among the Arabs and had kept their
	Jewish prejudice alive most ardently and jealously. They had adopted
	superficial Arabism because they could not survive in Arabia without
	it. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Because of this
	Arabism the western orientalists have been misled into thinking that
	perhaps they were not really Israelites but Arabs who had embraced
	Judaism, or that at least majority of them consisted of the Arab
	Jews. But there is no historical proof to show that the Jews ever
	engaged in any proselytizing activities in Hejaz, or their rabbis
	invited the Arabs to embrace Judaism like the Christian priests and
	missionaries. On the contrary, we see that they prided themselves
	upon their Israelite descent and racial prejudices. They called the
	Arabs the Gentiles, which did not mean illiterate or uneducated but
	savage and uncivilized people. They believed that the Gentiles did
	not possess any human rights; these were only reserved for the
	Israelites, and therefore, it was lawful and right for the
	Israelites to defraud them of their properties by every fair and
	foul means. Apart from the Arab chiefs, they did not consider the
	common Arabs fit enough to have equal status with them even if they
	entered Judaism. No historical proof is available, nor is there any
	evidence in the Arabian traditions, that some Arab tribe or
	prominent clan might have accepted Judaism. However, mention has
	been made of some individuals, who had become Jews. The Jews,
	however, were more interested in their trade and business than in
	the preaching of their religion. That is why Judaism did not spread
	as a religion and creed in Hejaz but remained only as a mark of
	pride and distinction of a few Israelite tribes. The Jewish rabbis,
	however, had a flourishing business in granting amulets and charms,
	fortune telling and sorcery, because of which they were held in
	great awe by the Arabs for their &quot;knowledge&quot; and practical
	wisdom. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Economically they
	were much stronger than the Arabs. Since they bad emigrated from
	more civilized and culturally advanced countries of Palestine and
	Syria, they knew many such arts as were unknown to the Arabs; they
	also enjoyed trade relations with the outside world. Hence, they had
	captured the business of importing grain in Yathrib and the upper
	Hejaz and exporting dried dates to other countries. Poultry farming
	and fishing also were mostly under their controls They were good at
	cloth weaving too. They had also set up wine shops here and there,
	where they sold wine which they imported from Syria. The Bani
	Qainuqa generally practiced crafts such as that of the goldsmith,
	blacksmith and vessel maker. In all these occupations, trade and
	business these Jews earned exorbitant profits, but their chief
	occupation was trading in money lending in which they had ensnared
	the Arabs of the surrounding areas. More particularly the chiefs and
	elders of the Arab tribes who were given to a life of pomp, bragging
	and boasting on the strength of borrowed money were deeply indebted
	to them. They lent money on high rates of interest and then would
	charge compound interest, which one could hardly clear off once one
	was involved in it. Thus, they had rendered the Arabs economically
	hollow, but it had naturally induced a deep rooted hatred among the
	common Arabs against the Jews. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<LI><P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The demand of
	their trade and economic interests was that they should neither
	estrange one Arab tribe by befriending another, nor take part in
	their mutual wars. But, on the other hand, it was also in their
	interests, that they should not allow the Arabs to be united and
	should keep them fighting and entrenched against each other, for
	they knew that whenever the Arab tribes united, they would not allow
	them to remain in possession of their 1large properties, gardens and
	fertile lands, which they had come to own through their profiteering
	and money lending business. Furthermore, each of their tribes also
	had to enter into alliance with one or another powerful Arab tribe
	for the sake of its own protection so that no other powerful tribe
	should overawe it by its might. Because of this they had not only to
	take part in the mutual wars of the Arabs but they often had to go
	to war in support of the Arab tribe to which their tribe was tied in
	alliance against another Jewish tribe which was allied to the enemy
	tribe. In Yathrib the Bani Quraizah and the Bani an-Nadir were the
	allies of the Aus while the Bani Qainuqa of the Khazraj. A little
	before the Holy Prophet's emigration, these Jewish tribes had
	confronted each other in support of their respective allies in the
	bloody war that took place between the Aus and the Khazraj at Buath.

</OL>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Such were the
conditions when Islam came to Madinah, and ultimately an Islamic
State came into existence after the Holy Prophet's (upon whom be
Allah's peace) arrival there. One of the first things that he
accomplished soon after establishing this state was unification of
the Aus and the Khazraj and the Emigrants into a brotherhood, and the
second was that he concluded a treaty between the Muslims and the
Jews on definite conditions, in which it was pledged that neither
party would encroach on the rights of the other, and both would unite
in a joint defense against the external enemies. Some important
clauses of this treaty are as follows, which clearly show what the
Jews and the Muslims had pledged to adhere to in their mutual
relationship: </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">&quot;The Jews must bear their
expenses and the Muslims their expenses. Each must help the other
against anyone who attacks the people of this document. They must
seek mutual advice and consultation, and loyalty is a protection
against treachery. They shall sincerely wish one another well. Their
relations will be governed by piety and recognition of the rights of
others, and not by sin and wrongdoing. The wronged must be helped.
The Jews must pay with the believers so long as the war lasts.
Yathrib shall be a sanctuary for the people of this document. If any
dispute or controversy likely to cause trouble should arise, it must
be referred to God and to Muhammad the Apostle of God; Quraish and
their helpers shall not be given protection. The contracting parties
are bound to help one another against any attack on Yathrib; Every
one shall be responsible for the defense of the portion to which he
belongs&quot; (</FONT><EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">lbn Hisham</FONT></EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">,
vol. ii, pp. 147 to 150). </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This was on absolute
and definitive covenant to the conditions of which the Jews
themselves had agreed. But not very long after this they began to
show hostility towards the Holy Prophet of Allah (upon whom be
Allah's peace) and Islam and the Muslims, and their hostility and
perverseness went on increasing day by day. Its main causes were
three: </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First, they envisaged
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) merely as a chief of
his people, who should be content to have concluded a political
agreement with them and should only concern himself with the worldly
interests of his group. But they found that he was extending an
invitation to belief in Allah and the Prophethood and the Book (which
also included belief in their own Prophets and scriptures), and was
urging the people to give up disobedience of Allah and adopt
obedience to the Divine Commands and abide by the moral laws of their
own prophets. This they could not put up with. They feared that if
this universal ideological movement gained momentum it would destroy
their rigid religiosity and wipe out their racial nationhood. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Second, when they saw
that the Aus and the Khazraj and the Emigrants were uniting into a
brotherhood and the people from the Arab tribes of the surrounding
areas, who entered Islam, were also joining this Islamic Brotherhood
of Madinah and forming a religious community, they feared that the
selfish policy that they had been following of sowing discord between
the Arab tribes for the promotion of their own well being and
interests for centuries, would not work in the new system, but they
would face a united front of the Arabs against which their intrigues
and machinations would not succeed. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Third, the work that
the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom be Allah's 'peace) was
carrying out of reforming the society and civilization included
putting an end to all unlawful methods&quot; in business and mutual
dealings. More than that; he had declared taking and giving of
interest also as impure and unlawful earning. This caused them the
fear that if his rule became established in Arabia, he would declare
interest legally forbidden, and in this they saw their own economic
disaster and death. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">For these reasons they made
resistance and opposition to the Holy Prophet their national ideal.
They would never hesitate to employ any trick and machination, any
device and cunning, to harm him. They spread every kind of falsehood
so as to cause distrust against him in the people's minds. They
created every kind of doubt, suspicion and misgiving in the hearts of
the new converts so as to turn them back from Islam. They would make
false profession of Islam and then would turn apostate so that it may
engender more and more misunderstandings among the people against
Islam and the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace). They would
conspire with the hypocrites to create mischief and would cooperate
with every group and tribe hostile to Islam. They would create rifts
between the Muslims and would do whatever they could to stir them up
to mutual feuds and fighting. The people of the Aus and the Khazraj
tribes were their special target, with whom they had been allied for
centuries. Making mention of the war of Buath before them they would
remind them of their previous enmities so that they might again
resort to the sword against each other and shatter their bond of
fraternity into which Islam had bound them. They would resort to
every kind of deceit and fraud in order to harm the Muslims
economically. Whenever one of those with whom that had business
dealings, would accept Islam, they would do whatever they could to
cause him financial loss. If he owed them something they would worry
and harass him by making repeated demands, and if they owed him
something, they would withhold the payment and would publicly say
that at the time the bargain was made he professed a different
religion, and since he had changed his religion, they were no longer
under any obligation towards him. Several instances of this nature
have been cited in the explanation of verse 75 of Surah Al Imran
given in the commentaries by Tabari, Nisaburi, Tabrisi and in </FONT><EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Ruh
al Ma'ani</FONT></EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">They had adopted this hostile
attitude against the covenant even before the Battle of Badr. But
when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and the Muslims
won a decisive victory over the Quraish at Badr, they were filled
with grief and anguish, malice and anger. They were in fact
anticipating that in that war the powerful Quraish would deal a death
blow to the Muslims. That is why even before the news of the Islamic
victory reached Madinah they had begun to spread the rumor that the
Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) had fallen a martyr and the
Muslims had been routed, and the Quraish army under Abu Jahl was
advancing on Madinah. But when the battle was decided against their
hopes and wishes, they burst with anger and grief. Ka'b bin Ashraf,
the chief of the Bani an-Nadir, cried out:&quot;By God, if Muhammad
has actually killed these nobles of Arabia, the earth's belly would
be better for us than its back.&quot; Then he went to Makkah and
incited the people to vengeance by writing and reciting provocative
elegies for the Quraish chiefs killed at Badr. Then he returned to
Madinah and composed lyrical verses of an insulting nature about the
Muslim women. At last, enraged with his mischief, the Holy Prophet
(upon whom be Allah's peace) sent Muhammad bin Maslamah Ansari in
Rabi al-Awwal, A. H. 3, and had him slain. (</FONT><EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Ibn

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The first Jewish tribe which, after
the Battle of Badr, openly and collectively broke their covenant were
the Bani Qainuqa. They lived in a locality inside the city of
Madinah. As they practiced the crafts of the goldsmith, blacksmith
and vessel maker, the people of Madinah had to visit their shops
fairly frequently. They were proud of their bravery and valor. Being
blacksmiths by profession even their children were well armed, and
they could instantly muster 700 fighting men from among themselves.
They were also arrogantly aware that they enjoyed relations of
confederacy with the Khazraj and Abdullah bin Ubbay, the chief of
the, Khazraj, was their chief supporter. At the victory of Badr, they
became so provoked that they began to trouble and harass the Muslims
and their women in particular, who visited their shops. By and by
things came to such a pass that one day a Muslim woman was stripped
naked publicly in their bazaar. This led to a brawl in which a Muslim
and a Jew were killed. Thereupon the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
Allah's peace) himself visited their locality, got them together and
counseled them on decent conduct. But the reply that they gave was;
&quot;O Muhammad, you perhaps think we are like the Quraish. They did
not know fighting; therefore, you overpowered them. But when you come
in contact with us, you will see how men fight.&quot; This was in
clear words a declaration of war. Consequently, the Holy Prophet
(upon whom be Allah's peace) laid siege to their quarters towards the
end of Shawwal (and according to some others, of Dhi Qa'dah) A. H. 2.
The siege had hardly lasted for a fortnight when they surrendered and
all their fighting men were tied and taken prisoners. Now Abdullah
bin Ubayy came up in support of them and insisted that they should be
pardoned. The Holy Prophet conceded his request and decided that the
Bani Qainuqa would be exiled from Madinah leaving their properties,
armor and tools of trade behind. (</FONT><EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Ibn

<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For some time after
these punitive measures (i. e. the banishment of the Qainuqa and
killing of Ka'b bin Ashraf the Jews remained so terror stricken that
they did not dare commit any further mischief. But later when in
Shawwal, A. H. 3, the Quraish in order to avenge themselves for the
defeat at Badr, marched against Madinah with great preparations, and
the Jews saw that only a thousand men had marched out with the Holy
Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) as against three thousand men of
the Quraish, and even they were deserted by 300 hypocrites who
returned to Madinah, they committed the first and open breach of the
treaty by refusing to join the Holy Prophet in the defense of the
city although they were bound to it. Then, when in the Battle of Uhud
the Muslims suffered reverses, they were further emboldened. So much
so that the Bani an-Nadir made a secret plan to kill the Holy Prophet
(upon whom be Allah's peace) though the plan failed before it could
be executed. According to the details, after the incident of Bi'r
Maunah (Safar, A. H. 4) Amr bin Umayyah Damri slew by mistake two men
of the Bani Amir in retaliation, who actually belonged to a tribe
which was allied to the Muslims, but Amr had mistaken them for the
men of the enemy. Because of this mistake their blood money became
obligatory on the Muslims. Since the Bani an-Nadir were also a party
in the alliance with the Bani Amir, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
Allah's peace) went to their clan along with some of his Companions
to ask for their help in paying the blood money. Outwardly they
agreed to contribute, as he wished, but secretly they plotted that a
person should go up to the top of the house by whose wall the Holy
Prophet was sitting and drop a rock on him to kill him. But before
they could execute their plan, he was informed in time and be
immediately got up and returned to Madinah. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now there was no
question of showing them any further concession. The Holy Prophet at
once sent to them the ultimatum that the treachery they had meditated
against him had come to his knowledge; therefore, they were to leave
Madinah within ten days; if anyone of them was found staying behind
in their quarters, he would be put to the sword. Meanwhile Abdullah
bin Ubayy sent them the message that he would help them with two
thousand men and that the Bani Quraizah and Bani Ghatafan also would
come to their aid; therefore, they should stand firm and should not
go. On this false assurance they responded to the Holy Prophet's
ultimatum saying that they would not leave Madinah and he could do
whatever was in his power. Consequently, in Rabi' al-Awwal, A. H. 4,
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) laid siege to them, and
after a few days of the siege (which according to some traditions
were 6 and according to others 15 days) they agreed to leave Madinah
on the condition that they could retain all their property which they
could carry on thee camels, except the armor. Thus, Madinah was rid
of this second mischievous tribe of Jews. Only two of the Bani
an-Nadir became Muslims and stayed behind. Others went to Syria and
Khaiber. </FONT></FONT>

	and whose forts were well fortified could not stand siege even for a

	single man from among them was slain. Allah says that this happened
	not because of any power possessed by the Muslims but because the
	Jews had tried to resist and fight Allah and His Messenger, and

	the reader should understand one thing at the outset so as to avoid
	any confusion about the banishment of the Bani an-Nadir. The Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) had concluded a formal written
	treaty with the Bani an-Nadir. They had not broken this agreement as
	such that it should have become void But the reason why they were
	attacked was that after making different kinds of minor violations
	of it, they at last committed such an offense which amounted to the
	breach of trust. That is, they plotted to kill the leader of the
	other party to the treaty, i. e. the Islamic State of Madinah. The
	plot became exposed, and when the were accused of breaking the
	agreement they could not deny it Thereupon, the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be Allah's peace) told them either to leave Madinah or to be
	ready for a war. This notice was in accordance with this injunction
	of the Qur'an: &quot;If you ever fear treachery from any people,
	throw their treaty openly before them. &quot; (AI-Anfal: 58) That is
	why Allah is describing their exile as His own action, for it was
	precisely in accordance with Divine Law. In other words, they were
	not expelled by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and
	the Muslims but by Allah Himself. The other reason why Allah has
	described their exile as His own action, has been stated in the
	following verses.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>The
	word hashr in the Text means to gather the scattered individuals to
	gather or to take out scattered individuals after mustering them
	together. Thus, the words li-awwal-il-hashr mean: with the first
	hashr or on the occasion of the first hashr. As for the question,
	what is implied by the first hashr here, the commentators have
	disputed it. According to one group it implies the banishment of the
	Bani an-Nadir from Madinah, and this has been described as their
	first hashr in the sense that their second hashr took place in the
	time of Hadrat `Umar, when the Jews and the Christians were expelled
	from the Arabian peninsula, and the final hashr will take place on
	the Day of Resurrection. According to the second group it implies
	the gathering of the Muslim army together to fight the Bani
	an-Nadir; and li-awwal-il-hashr means that as soon as the Muslims
	had gathered together to fight them, and no blood yet had been shed,
	they, by the manifestation of Allah's power, offered to be banished
	from Madinah of their own accord. In other words, these words have
	been used here in the meaning of &quot;at the very first assault&quot;.
	Shah Waliullah has translated it &quot;at the first gathering of the
	army&quot;. Shah 'Abdul Qadir has translated it &quot;at the first
	mustering.&quot; In our opinion this translation very nearly gives
	the meaning of these words.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>To
	understand this one should keep in mind the fact that the Bani
	anNadir had been well established here for centuries. They lived in
	compact populations outside Madinah without any lien element. Their
	settlement was well fortified, which had fortified houses as are
	generally built in feud-ridden tribal areas. Then heir numerical
	strength also equaled that of the Muslims, and inside Madinah itself
	many of the hypocrites were their supporters..Therefore, the.
	Muslims could never expect that they would, even without fighting,
	be so unnerved by the siege as to leave their homes willingly.
	likewise, the Bani an-Nadir also could not have imagined that some
	power would compel them to leave their homes within six days,
	Although the Bani Qainuqa' had been expelled before them, and their
	false pride of valor had proved to be of no avail, they lived in a
	locality inside Madinah and did not have any separate fortified
	settlement; therefore, the Bani an-Nadir thought that their
	inability to withstand the Muslims was not exceptionable, Contrary
	to this, in view of their own fortified settlement and strongholds
	they could not imagine that some power could turn them out so
	easily. That is why when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's
	peace) served a notice on them to leave Madinah within ten days,
	they boldly retorted, saying: We are not going to quit: you may do
	whatever you please.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, the
	question arises: On what basis has Allah said: 'They were thinking
	that their fortresses would save them from Allah'. Did the Bani
	an-Nadir really know that they were not facing Muhammad bin
	`Abdullah (upon whom be Allah's peace) but Allah? And did they, in
	spite of knowing this, think that their fortresses would save them
	from Allah? .This is a question which would confound every such
	person who does not know the psychology of the Jewish people and
	their centuries-old traditions. As regards the common men, no one
	can imagine that despite their knowing consciously that they were
	facing Allah, they would Entertain the false hope that their forts
	and weapons would save them from Allah. Therefore, an ignorant
	person would interpret the Divine Word, saying that the Bani
	an-Nadir in view of the strength of their forts were apparently
	involved in the misunderstanding that they would remain safe from
	the Holy Prophet's attack, but in reality they were fighting Allah
	and from Him their forts could not save them. But the fact is that
	the Jews in this world are a strange people, who have been knowingly
	fighting Allah: they killed the Prophets of Allah knowing them to be
	His Prophets, and they declared boastfully and arrogantly that they
	had killed the Prophets of Allah. Their traditions say that their
	great Patriarch, the prophet Jacob, wrestled with Allah throughout
	the night and Allah could not throw him even till daybreak. .Then,
	when at daybreak Allah asked Jacob to let Him go, Jacob replied that
	he would not let Him go until He blessed him. Allah asked him his
	name, and he answer `Jacob Allah said that his name would no longer
	be Jacob, but Israel, &quot;because you strove with God and with
	men, and prevailed.&quot; (See Gen. 32: 25-29 in the latest Jewish
	translation; The Scriptures Scriptures, published by the Jewish
	Publication Society of America 1954). In the Christian translation
	of the Bible too this subject has been rendered likewise. In the
	footnote of the Jewish translation, &quot;Israel&quot; has been
	explained as: He who striveth with God. &quot; In the Cyclopaedia of
	Biblical Literature the meaning given of Israel&quot; by the
	Christian scholars is: &quot;Wrestler with God.&quot; Then in Hosea
	(O.T.) the Prophet Jacob has been praised thus: &quot;By his
	strength he had power with God: yea, he had power over the angel,
	and prevailed. &quot; (Ch. 12: 3-4). Now, obviously, the people of
	Israel are the children of the same Prophet Israel who, according to
	their faith, had striven with God and wrestled with Him. For them it
	is not at all difficult that they should stand firm and fight even
	God. On this very basis, they, even according to their own
	profession, killed the Prophets of God, and under the same false
	pride they put the Prophet Jesus on the cross and bragged: &quot;We
	have killed Jesus Christ, son of Mary, Messenger of Allah. &quot;
	Therefore, it was not against their traditions that they fought
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) despite their knowledge that
	he was Allah's Messenger. If not their common people, their rabbis
	and learned men knew full well that he was the Messenger of Allah.
	The Qur'an itself contains several evidences to this effect. (For
	instance, see E:N.'s 79, 95 of Al-Baqarah, E.N.'s 190, 191 of
	An-Nisa, E.N.'s 70, 73 of As-Saaffat). &nbsp;

	are many lessons which one can learn from this event, which have
	been alluded to in this brief but eloquent sentence These Jews were
	none other but the followers of the former Prophets: they believed
	in God, in the Book, in the former Prophets and the Hereafter.
	Accordingly, they were the former Muslims. But when they turned
	their back on religion and morality and adopted open hostility to
	the truth only for the sake of their selfish desires and worldly
	motives and interests, and showed scant regard for their treaties
	and agreements, Allah's grace was turned away from them, otherwise
	Allah had no personal enmity with than. Therefore, first of all, the
	Muslims themselves have been admonished to heed their fate and Learn
	a lesson from it, lest they too should start behaving as if they
	were the beloved children of God, as the Jews did, and should be
	involved in the misunderstanding that their being included among the
	followers of the Last Prophet of God would by itself guarantee for
	them Allah's bounty and His support, apart from which they were not
	bound to adhere to any demand of religion and morality. Besides,
	those people of the world also have been asked to learn a lesson
	from this event, who oppose the truth consciously, and then place
	reliance upon their wealth and power, their means and resources,
	thinking that these would save them from the Divine punishment. The
	Jews of Madinah were not unaware that the Holy Prophet Muhammad
	(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) had not risen for the
	supremacy of a people or tribe, but he was presenting an ideological
	invitation the addressees of which were all men, and every man, no
	matter what race or country he belonged to, could join his Ummah by
	accepting the invitation, without discrimination or distinction.
	They were themselves witnessing that Bilal of Habash, Suhaib of
	Rome, and Salman of Persia enjoyed the same position and status in
	the Muslim community as was enjoyed by the people of the Holy
	Prophet's own house. Therefore, they were not feeling any danger
	that the Quraish and the Aus and the Khazrij would gain an upper
	hand over them. Nor were they unaware that the ideological
	invitation that he was presenting was precisely the same as their
	own Prophets had been presenting. The Holy Prophet never put forward
	the claim that he had come with a new religion, unknown to the
	people, and that the people should give up their former religion and
	accept his religion ' instead. But what he claimed was that the
	religion being presented by him was the same that the Prophets of
	God had been preaching and presenting since the beginning of
	creation. And from their Torah they could themselves confirm that it
	was actually the same religion, the principles of which were not any
	different from the principles of the religion of the Prophets. On
	the same basis they were told in the Qur'an: Affirm faith in the
	teaching sent down by Me, which confirms the teaching that you
	already possess, and you should not be its first deniers.&quot; They
	were also witnessing what character and morals the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be Allah's peace) possessed, and what revolution had
	taken place in the lives of those who had accepted his message. For
	a long time the Ansar of Madinah had been their closest neighbors.
	They knew what kind of people they had been before embracing Islam
	and what they became after their conversion to Islam. Thus, they
	were well aware of the invitation, of the inviter and of the results
	of accepting the invitation. But in spite of witnessing and knowing
	all this, only on account of their racial prejudice and worldly
	interests, they expended all their energy against the message of
	truth about which there was no room for doubt at least in their
	minds. After such an obvious and open hostility to the truth they
	expected that their strongholds would save them from Allah, whereas
	the whole human history bears evidence that the one who is resisted
	by the power of God, cannot save and protect himself by any weapon,
	means or device.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote9sym" HREF="#sdfootnote9anc">9</A>The
	reference is to the fact that the Muslims cut down or burnt many of
	the palm-trees that stood in the oases around the settlement of the
	Bani an Nadir in order to facilitate the siege, However, they left
	those trees standing which did not obstruct the military operations.
	At this the hypocrites of Madinah and the Bani Quraizah, and the
	Bani an-Nadir themselves, raised a clamor, saying that, on the one
	hand, Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) prohibited
	spreading disorder in the world, but, on the other, fruit trees were
	being cut down by his command, which amounted to spreading disorder
	in the world. At this Al-Hashr Allah ,sent down the Command:
	'Whatever trees you cut down, or whatever you left standing, your
	neither act was unlawful, but it had Allah's permission.&quot; The
	legal injunction that is derived from this verse is that the
	destruction caused for the sake of military operations does not come
	under &quot;spreading disorder in the world. &quot; But spreading
	disorder in the world is that an army under the fit of war hysteria
	.should intrude into the enemy territory and start destroying the
	crops, cattle. gardens, houses and everything in its way without any
	reason. In this matter. the general instruction is the same which
	Hadrat Abu Bakr Siddiq gave while dispatching the Muslim army to
	Syria: &quot;Do not cut down fruit trees; do not destroy crops; do
	not ravage the settlements.&quot; This was precisely in accordance
	with the Qur'anic teaching, which condemns those who spread chaos;
	'When they get power they direct all their efforts towards spreading
	corruption in the land, destroying harvests and killing people.&quot;
	(AI-Baqarah: 205). But the specific command in respect of the war
	exigencies is that if destruction is necessary for military
	operations against the enemy, it is lawful. Thus, Hadrat 'Abdullah
	bin Mas'ud has given this explanation in the commentary of this
	verse: 'The Muslims had cut down only those trees of the Bani
	an-Nadir that stood on the battlefield. &quot; (Tafsir Nisaburi).
	Some of the Muslim jurists have overlooked this aspect of the matter
	and expressed the opinion that the permissibility of cutting the
	trees of the Bani an-Nadir was confined only to that particular
	event. It does not make it generally permissible that whenever war
	necessitates trees of the enemy be cut down and burnt. Imam Auza'i,
	Laith and Abu Thaur hold this same opinion. But the majority of the
	jurists hold the view that for the sake of important military
	operations it is permissible. However, this is not permissible for
	the purpose of mere destruction and pillage. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One may
	ask: This verse of the Qur'an could satisfy the Muslims, but how
	could those who did not accept the Qur'an as Divine Word be
	satisfied at this reply to their objection that both acts were
	permissible as they had Allah's permission for it? The answer is:
	This verse of the Qur'an was sent down to satisfy only the Muslims;
	it was not sent down to satisfy the disbelievers. Since due to the
	objection of the Jews and the hypocrites, or due to their own
	thinking, they had been involved in the misgiving whether they were
	guilty of spreading disorder in the earth, Allah gave them the
	satisfaction that both the acts, cutting down some trees to
	facilitate the siege and leaving some other trees standing which did
	not obstruct the siege, were in accordance with Divine Law. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	traditionists in their traditions have disputed the point whether
	the order to cut and burn the trees had been given by the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace himself, or whether the Muslims
	had done it of their own accord, and then later asked the Holy
	Prophet about its legal aspect. Hadrat Abdullah bin 'Umar has
	reported that the Holy Prophet himself had ordered it. (Bukhari,
	Muslim , Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Jarir). The same also has been reported
	by Yazid bin. Ruman (Ibn Jarir). On the contrary, Mujahid and
	Qatadah say that the Muslims had on their own cut down the trees;
	then a dispute arose among them whether what they had done was
	permissible or not. Some said it was permissible and some said it
	was not. At last Allah sent down this verse and approved the act of
	both. (Ibn Jarir). The same thing is supported by a tradition of
	Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas: 'The Muslims were confused because Some
	of them had cut the trees and others had not; therefore, they wanted
	to ask the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) as to who would
	be rewarded for the act and who would be punished.' (Nasa i). Those
	of the jurists who have preferred the first tradition give the
	argument that this was the Holy Prophet's personal judgment, which
	was later ratified by revelation from Allah, and this a proof of the
	fact that in matters where no Divine Command existed, the Holy
	Prophet used to follow his personal judgment. On the other hand,
	those jurists who have preferred the second tradition, argue that
	the two groups of the Muslims had adopted two different views on the
	basis of their own personal judgments and Allah ratified both.
	Therefore, if the learned men arrive at different conclusions by
	judicious exercise of their personal judgment, then although their
	opinions might differ, they would all be correct in the Divine Shari
	ah. &nbsp;

	is, &quot;Allah willed that they should be disgraced if you cut down
	the trees and also if you left them standing.&quot; In the first
	case, they were disgraced when they saw that the trees of the
	gardens which they had planted with their own hands and which they
	had owned since ages, were being cut down before their very eyes and
	they were watching it helplessly. Even an ordinary peasant and
	gardener cannot tolerate another's misappropriation or intrusion
	into his field or garden. He would protect his field or garden at
	the risk of his life if somebody tried to destroy it in his
	presence. For if he cannot prevent destruction of his property, it
	would be a sign of his extreme humiliation and weakness. But here a
	whole tribe, which had been living at this place fearlessly and
	boldly for centuries, was watching helplessly that its neighbors had
	invaded its gardens and were destroying the trees while it could do
	nothing. After this even if they stayed on in Madinah they would
	have lived in disgrace and humility. In the second case, they were
	disgraced when on leaving Madinah they saw that the lush green
	gardens which had been in their possession till the previous day
	were now passing into the possession of the Muslims. Had they the
	power they would have laid waste the entire gardens by their own
	hands SO that not a single whole tree passed into the hands of the

	here to the end of verse 10, Allah explains how the lands and
	properties that were restored to the Islamic State after the exile
	of the Ban; an- Nadir, are to be managed and administered. As it was
	the first occasion that a land was conquered and included in the
	Islamic territory, and many more lands were destined to be conquered
	in the future, the law governing the conquered lands was enunciated
	at the outset. Here, a note-worthy point is that Allah at this place
	has used the words: Ma af'-Allahu ala Rasuli-hi min-hum &quot;whatever
	Allah restored to His Messenger from them.&quot; These words clearly
	imply that the rebels of Allah Almighty are not entitled to own the
	earth and things existing on it. If they have become their owners
	and are appropriating them, their ownership and appropriation of
	these things is, in fact, in the nature of usurpation of a master's
	property by a dishonest servant. The real right of these properties
	is that these should be spent and used in the service and obedience
	of their real Master, Allah, Lord of the worlds, according to His
	will, and their this use is possible only through the agency of the
	righteous believers. Therefore, the true position of the properties
	which pass from the ownership of the disbelievers into the hands of
	the Muslims as the result of a lawful war, is that their real Owner
	has withdrawn them from His disobedient and disloyal servants, and
	restored them to His obedient and loyal servants. That is why, in
	the terminology of the Islamic Law such properties have been
	described as Fai (restored properties). &nbsp;

	the result of the effort of the actual fighting army so that the
	army on that basis may have the right that the properties may be
	distributed among the soldiers, but its real nature is that Allah by
	His bounty has given dominance to His Messengers and the system that
	they represent over them. In other words, the passing of these
	properties into the Muslims' hands is not the direct result of the
	effort and struggle of the fighting army, but the result of the
	total strength that Allah has bestowed on His Messenger and his

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus, the
	Shari ah has made a distinction between ghanimah (spoils of war) and
	fai (restored properties). The injunction :n respect of the ghanimah
	has been given in surah AI-Anfal: 41, and it is this &quot;It should
	be divided in five parts, four parts of which be distributed among
	the fighting army and the fifth deposited in the Public Treasury
	(Bait al-Mal), and expended on the items mentioned in the verse.&quot;
	As for the fai, the injunction is that it should not be distributed
	among the army, but it should be reserved for the items of
	expenditure being stated in the following verse. The distinction
	between the two has been made plain by the words: &quot;You have not
	rushed your horses and camels on them,&quot; which imply the
	military operations. Thus, the properties which are taken as a
	direct result of such operations are the ghnimah and those which arc
	not the result of these operations are the fai. The distinction
	between ghanimah and tai that has been mentioned in this verse, has
	been explained in greater detail by the juristis of Islam. Ghanimah
	are only those transferable properties which are taken from the
	enemy during military action; other things than these, e.g. lands,
	houses and other transferable and nontransferable properties of the
	enemy, are excluded from the definition of ghanimah and are fai. The
	source of this explanation is the letter that Hadrat 'Umar (may
	Allah be pleased with him) had written to Hadrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas
	after the conquest of 'Iraq. In that letter he wrote: &quot;Distribute
	the properties and goods which the soldiers of the army collected
	and brought to your camp among the Muslims who participated in the
	war, and leave the lands and the canals with those who work on them
	so that the proceeds thereof are used for the salaries of the
	Muslims.&quot; (Abu Yusuf. Kitab al-Kharaj, p. 24; Abu 'Ubaid, Kitab
	al-Amwal, p. 59; Yahya bin Adam, Kitab al-Kharaj, pp. 27-28, 48). On
	this very basis, Hadrat Hasan Basri says: &quot;Whatever is taken
	from the enemy camp, is the right of those who won victory over it?
	and the lands are for the Muslims.&quot; Yahya bin Adam, p. 27). And
	Imam Abu Yusuf says: &ldquo;Whatever the Muslims take from the enemy
	troops, and whatever goods and arms and cattle they collect and
	bring to their camp, is ghanimah; from this one-fifth will be
	deducted and the rest distributed among the soldiers.&quot; (Kitab
	al-Kharaj, p. 18). The same is the opinion of Yahya bin Adam, which
	he has expressed in his Kitab al-Kharaj (p. 27). Even more than
	this, what makes the distinction between ghanimah and fai clearer is
	that after the Battle of Nahawand when the ghanimah had been
	distributed and the conquered lands had been included in the Islamic
	State. a man named Sa'ib bin Aqra' found two bags of jewels outside
	the fort. He was confused whether it was the ghanimah which should
	be distributed in the army, or the fai which should be deposited in
	the Bait al-Mal Consequently, he came to Madinah and put the matter
	before Hadrat 'Umar, who decided that it should be sold and the
	price deposited in the Bait-al-Mal. From this it becomes clear that
	ghanimah are only those transferable properties which are taken by
	the soldiers during the war. After the war is over, the transferable
	properties also, like the nontransferable properties, become fai.
	Imam Abu 'Ubaid relates this event and says: &quot;The properties
	that arc seized from the enemy by the use of force, when the war is
	still in progress, are ghanimah and what is taken after the war is
	over, when the territory has become Dar al-Islam (abode of Islam),
	is fai, which should be reserved for the common people of the dar
	al-Islam; the law of the one-fifth (khums) will not be applicable to
	it. &quot; (Kitab al-Amwal p. 254).

	included all those properties which pass into the Muslims' ownership
	in every other way than as a result of actual fighting The
	differences that have arisen among the jurists of Islam have been
	only concerning the first kind of the properties in order to
	determine their correct legal position, for they do not come under
	'those upon which you have not rushed your horses and camels.&quot;
	As regards the second kind of the properties, all agree that they

	the preceding verse what was pointed out was why these properties
	should not be distributed among the fighting army like the spoils,
	and why the legal injunction concerning them is different from that
	concerning the spoils Now in this verse it is being stated as to who
	are entitled to have a share in these properties. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The first
	share in these is of Allah and His Messenger. The detail of how the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) acted on this injunction
	has been related by Malik bin Aus bin al-Hadathan on the authority
	of Hadrat 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), thus: The Holy
	Prophet used to take from it necessary expenses for himself and his
	family and the rest he used to spend on arranging arms and
	conveyances for Jihad. (Bukhari Muslim, Musnad Ahmad, Da 'ud,
	Tirmadhi Nasa i and others). After the passing away of the Holy
	Prophet this share was transferred to the Public Treasury of the
	Muslims so that it is spent in the service of the mission which
	Allah had entrusted to His Messenger. Imam Shafa' i is reported to
	have expressed the opinion that the share which was specifically
	meant for the Holy Prophet's person (upon whom be Allah's peace), is
	for his caliph after him, for the Holy Prophet was entitled to it on
	the basis of his office of leadership and not on the basis of the
	office of Apostleship. But the view of the. majority of the Shafe'i
	jurists in this matter is the same as of the other jurists, viz.
	that this share now is reserved for the religious and collective
	welfare of the Muslims, and not for any particular. person. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second share is of the kinsfolk, and this implies the kinsfolk of
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace), i.e. the Bani Hashim
	and the Bani al-Muttalib. This share was set aside so that, besides
	meeting his own and his family's requirements, the Holy Prophet
	could also fulfill his obligations towards those of his relatives
	who stood in need of his help, or whom he felt like helping. ,After
	the death of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) this
	ceased to be a separate and independent source, because like the
	right; of the orphans and the wayfarers and the indigent among the
	Muslims, looking after the rights of the needy among the Bani Hashim
	and the Bani al-Muttalib also became the responsibility of the
	Public Treasury. However, they were treated as superior to others in
	so far as they had no share in the zakat. Hadrat 'Abdullah bin
	'Abbas has related that in the time of Hadrat Abu Bakr and 'Umar and
	'Uthman (may Allah be pleased with them), the first two shares were
	dropped and only the remaining three shares (i.e. those for the
	orphans and the indigent and the wayfarers) were kept as of those
	entitled to fai Then Hadrat `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him)
	also acted on the same in his time, Muhammad bin Ishaq has related
	on the authority of Imam Muhammad Baqir that although Hadrat 'Ali's
	personal opinion was the same as of the people of his house (that
	this share should be given to the relatives of the Holy Prophet), he
	did not think that he should act against the practice of Abu Bakr
	and `Umar. Hasan bin Muhammad bin Hanafiyah says that after the Holy
	Prophet a difference of opinion arose about these two shares (i.e.
	the share of the Holy Prophet and the share of his relatives). Some
	people said that the first share should go to the Holy Prophet's
	caliph, some said that the second share should go to the relatives
	of the Holy Prophet, and still others said that the second share
	should be given to the relatives of the caliph. At last, a consensus
	was reached that both the shares be spent on the requirements of
	Jihad 'Ata' bin Sa'ib says that Hadrat 'Umar bin 'Abdul `Aziz in his
	time had started sending the share of the Holy Prophet and the share
	of the relatives to the Bani Hashim. The opinion of Imam Abu Hanifah
	and of most of the Hanafi jurists is that in this matter the same
	practice is cornet as was., being followed in the time of the
	righteous Caliphs. (Abu Yusuf, Kitab al-Kharaj pp. 19-21). Imam
	Share'i's opinion is that both the rich and the needy from among the
	people whose being descended from the Bani Hashim and the Bani
	al-Muttalib is confirmed, or is well known, can be given shares from
	fai. (Mughni al-Muhtaj). The Hanafis say that only their needy
	people can be helped from this; however, their right to this is
	greater than that of others. (Ruh al-Ma'ani). According to Imam
	Malik, there is no restriction on the government in this matter. It
	can spend on any head that it deems fit and proper, but the better
	course is that it should give preference to the people of the Holy
	Prophet's house. (Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi ala-sh-Sharh-al-Kabir). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">About the
	remaining three shares there is no dispute among the jurists.
	However, the difference between Imam Shafe'i and the other Imams is
	that according to Imam Shafe'i the total properties of fai are to be
	divided into five equal parts one part of which is to be spent on
	the above-mentioned heads in such a way that one-fifth of it is
	spent on the common benefits of the Muslims, one-fifth on the Bani
	Hashim and the Bani al-Muttalib, one-fifth on the orphans, one-fifth
	on the indigent and one-fifth on the wayfarers. However, Imam Malik,
	Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Ahmad do not concur with this division.
	Their opinion is that the whole of fai is for the welfare and common
	benefit of the Muslims. (Mughni al-Muhtaj).</P>

	is one of the most important verses of the Qur'an, which lays down
	the basic principle of the economic policy of the Islamic community
	and government. Wealth should circulate among the whole community
	and not only among the rich lest the rich should go on becoming
	richer day by day and the poor poorer. This policy has not merely
	been enunciated in the Qur'an, but for the same objective the Qur'an
	has forbidden interest, made the zakat obligatory, enjoined that
	khums (one-fifth) be deducted from the booty, exhorted the Muslims
	to practice voluntary charity, has proposed such forms of different
	kinds of atonements that the flow of wealth is turned towards the
	poor classes of society, and has made such a law of inheritance that
	the wealth left by every deceased person spreads among the largest
	circle of the people. Apart from this, stinginess has been condemned
	and generosity commended as a noble moral quality, the well-to-do
	people have been told that in their wealth there is a definite share
	of the beggar and the indigent, which they must discharge not as
	charity but as the right of the concerned people, and the law
	enjoined in respect of a major source of revenue of the Islamic
	government (i.e. far) is that its one portion must necessarily be
	spent on supporting the poor classes of society. In this connection,
	it should also be borne in mind that there are two main sources of
	the revenue of the Islamic government: zakat and fai. The zakat is
	charged from the Muslims on their total extra capital, cattle,
	wealth, trade goods and agricultural produce, which is over and
	above the minimum exemption limit (nisab), and most of it is
	reserved for the poor. And fai comprises all the revenues including
	jizyah and taxes which are received from the non-Muslims; a major
	part of these also is set aside for the poor, This gives a clear
	hint to the effect that an Islamic government should manage its
	revenues and expenditure and the financial and economic affairs of
	the country on the whole in such a manner that the wealthy and
	influential people are not allowed to have their monopoly over the
	means and resources of wealth, and the flow of wealth is neither
	turned from the poor to the rich nor it should remain circulating
	only among the rich. &nbsp;

	the Muslims should obey the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's

	when we consider that as against &quot;whatever the Messenger gives
	you&quot; the words used are &quot;whatever he forbids you&quot; and
	not &quot;what. ever he does not give you. &quot; If the object of
	the Command were restricted to call obedience to the distribution

	gives you&quot; the words should have been &quot;whatever he does

	in this context by itself shows that the object of the Command is to
	enjoin obedience to the Holy Prophet in whatever he commands and
	forbids. The same thing has been stated by the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be Allah's peace) himself. According to Hadrat Abu Hurairah he
	said: &quot;When I command you to do a thing, do it as far as you
	can; and when I forbid you to do a thing, restrain from it.&quot;
	(Bukhari, Muslim). About Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas'ud it has been

	the woman who practices such and such a fashion.&quot; Thereupon a
	woman approached him and asked, &quot;Where from have you derived
	this thing? For I have not seen such a thing anywhere in the Book of
	Allah.&quot; Hadrat `Abdullah replied, &quot;Had you studied the
	Book of Allah, you would certainly have found it therein. Have you
	not read the verse: Ma ata-kum ar-Rasulu fa-khudu hu wa ma naha-kum
	`anhu fantahu: &quot;Take whatever the Messenger gives you, and
	refrain from whatever he forbids you. &quot; When she said that she
	had read this verse, Hadrat `Abdullah said: &quot;So the Holy

	given the news that Allah has cursed the women who practice it. &quot;

	offered their gardens and oases to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be

	your rewards. &quot; (Musnad Ahmad). Then, when the territory of the
	Bani an-Nadir was taken, the Holy Prophet made this proposal to the
	Ansar: &quot;Now one way of managing it is that your properties and
	the gardens and the oases left by the Jews be combined together and
	then the whole distributed among you and the Emigrants.&quot; the

	Ansar said: &quot;Sir, you may please distribute these evacuee

	also as you please. &quot; At this Hadrat Abu Bakr cried out: &quot;May
	Allah reward you, O assembly of the Ansar, with the best of
	everything!&quot; (Yahya bin Adam. Baladhuri). Thus, with the
	willing consent of the Ansar the properties left by the Jews were
	distributed only among the Emigrants, and from among the Ansar only
	Hadrat Abu Dujanah, Hadrat Sahl bin Hunaif and (according to some)
	Hadrat Harith bin as-Simmah were given shares, for they were poor
	people. (Baladhuri. Ibn Hisham Ruh al-Ma ani. The same
	self-sacrificing spirit was shown by the Ansar when the territory of
	Bahrain was annexed to the Islamic State. The Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be Allah's peace) wished that the conquered lands of that
	territory be given to the Ansar, but they submitted: &quot;We would

	is a blessing of God, which one can attain only by God's bounty and
	grace The word shuhh is used for stinginess and miserliness in
	Arabic. But when this word is attributed to the self of matt it
	becomes synonymous with narrow-mindedness, niggardliness,
	meanspiritedness and small-heartedness, and not mete stinginess: it
	is rather the root cause of stinginess itself. Because of this very
	quality man avoids acknowledging even the good qualities of another,
	not to speak of recognizing his rights and discharging them. He
	wants that he alone should gather up everything in the world, and no
	one else should have anything of it. He never feels content with his

	have for himself all that is good in the world and should not leave
	anything for others. On this very basis one's being saved from this
	evil has been described in the Qur'an as a guarantee for success.
	The Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) has counted it among
	the most evil qualities of man which are the root cause of
	corruption and mischief. Hadrat Jabir bin `Abdullah has reported
	that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Avoid shuhh for it was shuhh which
	ruined the people before you. It incited them to shed each other's
	blood and make the sacred and forbidden things of others lawful for
	themselves. &quot; (Muslim, Musnad Ahmad, Baihaqi, Bukhari in
	Al-Adab). The tradition of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Umar contains the
	following words: &quot;It led them to commit wickedness and they
	committed it; it commanded them to commit sins and they committed
	sin; it urged them to break off all connections with the kindred and
	they broke off all connections with them. &quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Abu
	De ud Nasa i). Hadrat Abu Hurairah has reported that the Holy
	Prophet said. &quot;Faith and shuhh of the self cannot combine in
	one and the same heart. &quot; (Ibn Abi Shaibah, Nasa '% Baihaqi in
	Shu ab al-Iman, Hakim). Hadrat Abu Sa'id Khudri has stated that the
	Holy Prophet said: &quot;Two of the qualities are such that they
	cannot combine in a Muslim: stinginess and misbehaviour.&quot; (Abu
	Da'ud. Tirmidhi Bukhari in AI-Adab)- It is as a result of t us very
	teaching of Islam that, apart from individuals, the Muslim people as
	a nation are still the most generous and liberal. minded people in
	the world. There are millions and millions of Muslims living side by
	side with those non-Muslim people from among whom they sprung who
	have become proverbial for their narrow-mindedness and miserliness.
	The clear distinction existing between the two peoples in respect of
	liberal-mindedness and miserliness cannot be explained in any other

	generations which will be born till the Day of Resurrection. It is
	this important legal ruling of the Qur'an in the light of which
	Hadrat 'Umar(may Allah be pleased with him) introduced the new
	system in respect of the lands and properties of the conquered
	territories of 'Iraq, Syria and Egypt and of the possessions of the
	previous governments and rulers of those countries. When these
	countries were conquered; some of the distinguished Companions among
	whom were included prominent men like Hadrat Zubair, Hadrat Bilal,
	Hadrat 'Abdur Rahman bin 'Auf and Hadrat Salman Farsi, insisted that
	these should be distributed among the armies who had fought and
	conquered them. They thought that those properties did not come
	under &quot;those upon which you have not rushed your horses and
	camels,&quot; but the Muslims had conquered them by rushing their
	horses and camels on them. Therefore, except for those cities and
	territories which surnndcred without the war, all the rest of the
	conquered (ands came under ghanimah for which the legal command is
	that one fifth of the lands and the people be given to the Public
	Treasury and the remaining four parts be distributed among the
	soldiers. But this opinion was not correct on the ground that the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) had not distributed the
	lands and the people of any territory conquered by fighting in his
	time after the deduction of one-fifth, like the booty. Two of the
	most conspicuous precedents of his time were the conquest of Makkah
	and the conquest of Khaiber. Of these he handed over Makkah intact
	to its inhabitants. As for Khaiber, according to Hadrat Bushair bin
	Yasar, he divided it into 36 parts, of which he set aside 18 parts
	for collective benefits and requirements of the Muslims and
	distributed the remaining 18 among the army. (Abu Da'ud, Baihaqi,
	Abi 'Ubaid: Kitab al-Amwal; Yahya bin Adam: Kitab al-Kharj
	Baladhuri: Futuh al-Buldan; Ibn Human: Fath al-Qadir). This action
	of the Holy Prophet made it clear that the command in respect of the
	conquered lands, even if they might have been taken by fighting, is
	not the same as of the ghanimah otherwise he would never have given
	the whole of Makkah intact to the people of Makkah, and would have
	set aside exactly one-half of the properties of Khaiber for the
	common benefits of the Muslims instead of deducting its one-fifth
	for the Public Treasury. Thus, what was established on the basis of
	the Sunnah was: In respect of the territories conquered by fighting
	the ruler of the Muslims has the authority that he may take any
	decision that he dreams fit keeping in view the conditions of the
	time. He can distribute them if he so likes but if a territory has
	an unusual nature and importance, as Makkah had, he can also treat
	its inhabitants with favour, as the Holy Prophet treated the people

	Hadrat 'Umar, the Companions were faced with the problem whether the
	territories conquered by force were in the nature of ghanimah or
	fat. After the conquest of Egypt Hadrat Zubair demanded: &quot;Distribute
	this, whole land just as the Holy Prophet had distributed Khaiber. &quot;
	(Abu 'Ubaid). About the conquered territories of Syria and 'Iraq,
	Hadrat Bilal insisted: &quot;Distribute aII the lands among the
	fighting forces just as the spoils are distributed. '(Abu Yusuf,
	Kitab al-Kharaj On the other hand, Hadrat 'AIi gave this opinion:
	&quot;Leave these lands in possession of the peasants so that they
	continue to remain a source of income for the Muslims.&quot; (Abu
	Yusuf, Abu 'Ubaid,). Likewise, the opinion of Hadrat Mu'adh bin
	Jabal was; &quot;If you distributed these lands, evil consequences
	would occur. Because of this distribution large properties will pass
	into the hands of those few people, who have conquered them. Then,
	when these people pass away and their properties pass on to their
	heirs and there is left only one woman or only one man from among
	them, nothing might remain for the future generations to meet their
	needs and even to meet the expenses of safeguarding the frontiers of
	the Islamic State. Therefore, you should so settle things that the
	interests both of the present and of the future generations are
	equally safeguarded.&quot; (Abu `Ubaid, p. 59; Fath al-Bari, vol.
	vi, p. 138). Hadrat `Umar calculated and found that if the
	territories of `Iraq were distributed, each individual would receive
	two or three peasants on the average as his share, (Abu Yusuf. Abu
	'Ubaid). Thereupon he arrived at the judicious conclusion that those
	territories should not be distributed. Thus, the replies that he
	gave to those who demanded their distribution, were as follows:</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&ldquo;Do
	you want that for the people who come afterwards there should remain
	nothing?&quot; (Abu 'Ubaid).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What
	will happen of the Muslims who cane afterwards when they find that

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;What

	(Abu Yusuf)</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&ldquo;Had
	I no thought for those who would come afterwards, I would distribute
	every territory that I conquered just as the Messenger of AIIah had

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Nay:

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But
	the people were not satisfied with these replies, and they started
	saying that he was being unjust. At last, Hadrat 'Umar convened a
	meeting of the consultative body of the Companions and put the
	matter before it. Here are some of the sentences of the speech that
	he made on this occasion: &quot;I have given you this trouble so
	that you may join me in shouldering the trust that has been put in
	me for governing your affairs. I am one of you, and you are the
	people who affirm the truth today. Everyone of you has the option to
	agree to or differ from what I say. I do not wish that you should
	follow my desire. You have the Book of Allah, which states the whole
	truth. By God, if I have said something which I want to enforce, I
	have no object in view except the truth. You have heard those who
	think that I am being unjust to them and want to deprive them of
	their rights, whereas I seek Allah's refuge that I should commit an
	injustice. It would be vicious on my part if I withheld from them
	something which actually belonged to them and gave it to another.
	But I can see that no other land after the land of the Chosroe is
	going to fall. Allah has given the properties of the Persians and
	their lands and their peasants in our possession. I have distributed
	the booty taken by our armies among them after the deduction of the
	khums (one fifth), and am thinking of distributing the rest which
	yet remains. But as for the lands my opinion is that I should not
	distribute them and their peasants, but should levy revenue on the
	lands and jizyah on the peasants, which they should always pay, and
	this should be the fai for the common Muslims and their children and
	the armies of today and for the generations yet to come. Don't you
	see that we need the troops who should be appointed to protect these
	our frontiers? Don't you see that in territories like Syria,
	AI-Jazirah, Kufah, Basra, Egypt we should station our troops, and
	they should be regularly for their services? So, if I distribute
	these lands along with their peasants, how shall we meet these
	expenses?&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	debate went on for two or three days. Hadrat `Uthman Hadrat 'Ali,
	Hadrat Talhah, Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar and others concurred with
	Hadrat 'Umar, but nothing could be decided. At last, Hadrat `Umar
	rose and said: &quot;I have found an argument in the Book of Allah,
	which is decisive in this matter. Then, he recited these very verses
	of Surah AI-Hashr from Ma afaa'Allahu to Rabbana innaka Ra uf.
	ur-Rahim, and argued: &quot;The people of this day only are not
	entitled to receive a share in these properties bestowed by Allah,
	but AIlah has joined with them also those people who will come after
	them. Then, how can it be that we should distribute the fai
	properties which are meant for all, only among the conquerors and
	leave nothing for the later generations? Moreover, Allah says:
	'...so that this wealth does not remain circulating among your rich
	people only.' But if distribute it among the conquerors, it will
	remain circulating only among your rich and nothing would be left
	for others. &quot; This argument satisfied everybody and consensus
	was reached that all the conquered territories should be declared
	fai for the common benefits of the Muslims, which should be left
	with those who work on those lands and they should be put under
	revenue and jizyah. (Abu Yusuf Kitab al-Kharaj, pp. 23-27, 35;

	continue to pay the prescribed revenue to the Islamic government on
	those lands, their rights as cultivators would pass from generation
	to generation as heritage, and they would even be allowed to sill

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	Hanafis say that as regards the lands of the conquered territories
	the Islamic government (Imam in juristic terminology has the option
	that it may distribute them among the forces of conquest after
	deduction of the khums (onefifth), or may leave them with the former
	owners and put the owners under jizyah and the lands under revenue.
	In this case the land will be regarded as a 'legacy for the Muslims.
	(Badai' as-Sanai AI-Jassas, Ahkam al- Qur'an; Sharah al-Anayah al
	al-Hedayah; Fath al-Qadir). The same view has `Abdullah bin Mubarak
	cited for Imam Sufyan Thauri. (Yahya bin Adam; Abu 'Ubaid, Kitab
	a!-Amwal). </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	Malikis say that as soon as the lands have been conquered they
	automatically become a legacy for- the Muslims. It does not need the
	Imam's ruling or the willingness of the Muslim soldiers to declare
	them a legacy. Besides, the well known view among the Malikis is
	that not only the lands but the houses and buildings of the
	conquered territories also are, as a matter of fact, a legacy for
	the Muslims. However, the Islamic government will not charge the
	rent for them. (Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi)</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	Hanbalis agree with the Hanafis that the Imam has the option to
	distribute the lands among the soldiers or to declare them as a
	legacy for the Muslims, and with the Malikis that although the
	houses of the conquered territories are included the legacy, no rent
	will be levied on them. (GhayatalMuntaha which is a collection of
	the legal rulings of the Hanbali School of juristic thought and a
	source book for legal rulings since the 10th century). </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	Shafe'i I viewpoint is that all the transferable properties of the
	conquered territory are ghanimah, and all the non-transferable
	properties (lands, houses, etc.) fai. (Mughni al-Muhtaj). </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Some
	jurists have expressed the opinion the if the Imam wants to declare
	the lands of the territory taken by fighting as a legacy for the
	Muslims, he must first obtain the willingness of the conquering
	forces. For this they cite this argument: Hadrat 'Umar, before the
	conquest of Iraq, had promised Jarir bin 'Abdullah al-Banali, the
	people of whose tribe constituted one-fourth of the army, which
	fought the Battle of Qadisiyah, that they would be given one-fourth
	of the conquered territory. Thus, they retained this territory for
	two or three years. Then Hadrat 'Umar said to them: &quot;Had I not
	been responsible and answerable in the matter of division, I would
	have left with you whatever has been given to you. But now I see
	that the people have grown in numbers; therefore, my opinion is that
	you return it to the common people.&quot; Hadrat Jarir acceded to
	this, and Hadrat 'Umar gave him SO dinars as a prize. (Abu Yusuf,
	Kitab al-Kharaj; Abu 'Ubaid, Kitab al-Amwal From this they argue
	that Hadrat 'Umar had decided to declare the conquered territories
	as a legacy for the Muslims only after obtaining the willingness of
	the conquerors. But the majority of the jurists do not admit this
	argument, For in respect of all the conquered territories no such
	willingness of the conquerors ever was taken. Only in the case of
	Hadrat Jarir bin 'Abdullah this was done because Hadrat `Umar had
	made a promise with him prior to any collective decision about the
	conquered lands. Therefore, he had to obtain his willingness only in
	order to be free from the obligation of the promise. This cannot be
	cited as a general law. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another
	section of the jurists says that even after declaring the lands as a
	legacy the government retains the option that it may redistribute
	the lands among the conquerors. For this they argue from this
	tradition: Once Hadrat 'AII said to the people in an address: &quot;Had
	not there been the apprehension that you would fight among
	yourselves, I would have distributed the suburban lands among you.&quot;
	( Abu Yusuf, Kitab al-Kharaj; Abu `Ubaid, Kitab al-Amwal). But the
	majority of jurists do not admit this argument either. They are
	unanimous that when the people of the conquered territory have once
	been allowed to retain their lands and put under jizyah and revenue,
	the decision can never be changed later. As for the tradition
	attributed to Hadrat 'Ali Abu Bakr al-Jassas has discussed it at
	length in his Ahkam al-Qur an and proved it to be not authentic.&nbsp;

	this verse although the real object is only to pouts out that in fai
	not only the people of the present generation but .he Muslims of the
	later periods and their future generations also have a share, yet,
	besides, the Muslims have also been taught an important moral lesson
	that they should never have any malice against other Muslims in
	their hearts, and they should continue to pray for the forgiveness
	of the Muslims who have gone before them instead of cursing and
	abusing them. The bond that binds the Muslims together is that of a
	common Faith. If a person values his Faith as the most important
	thing in his heart, inevitably he would be a well-wisher of all
	those people who are his brethren-in faith. He can have ill-will and
	malice and hatred towards them in his heart only when the value of
	the Faith decreases in his sight and he starts valuing other things
	more. Therefore, it is the requirement of Faith that a believer's
	heart should be free from every trace of malice and hatred against
	the other believers. In this matter the best lesson is given by a
	Hadith which Nasa'i has related from Hadrat Anas. According to him,
	once it so happened that for three days continuously the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) declared in his assembly that a
	person was going to appear before them who belonged to the dwellers
	of Paradise, and every time it would be a certain person from among
	the Ansar. At this Hadrat 'Abdullah bin `Amr bin `As became curious
	as to what deeds the person concerned performed on the basis of
	which the Holy Prophet had repeatedly given the good news of his
	admission to Paradise. Thus, he made an excuse and spent three
	consecutive nights in his house to see how he performed his worship,
	but during the night he did not sec any thing unusual. At last, he
	asked him directly as to what special acts and devotions he
	performed on the basis of which the Holy Prophet had given the great
	good news about him. He replied: &deg;You have seen how I perform my
	worship, but there is one thing which might have carved me this
	reward: I do not harbor any malice or evil design against any
	Muslim, nor fuel jealous of him on account of any good that Allah
	might have bestowed on him.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
	does not mean that if a Muslim finds an error in another Muslim's
	word or deed, he should avoid calling it an error. Faith does not
	demand this. Rut to describe an error as a mistake on the basis of
	an argument and to state it to be so in a polite and decent manner
	is one thing and harbor malice and hatred and resort to invective
	and abuse quite another. It is wrong if one resorts to this in
	respect of one's contemporaries, but worse if one resorted to this
	in respect of the dead people of the past. For the person indulging
	in such a thing would be a most filthy person for he is not even
	inclined to forgive the dead. And the worst would be that a person
	should resort to invective and abuse in respect of those illustrious
	people who had done full justice to the Holy Prophet's companionship
	in a period full of extreme tribulations and hardships and had
	struggled with their lives to spread the light of Islam in the world
	and enabled us today to be blessed with the Faith. One can hold and
	opinion if one thinks that such and such party of them was in the
	right and such and such in the wrong in its viewpoint in the
	differences that arose between them, and can even express his
	opinion in a reasonable and decent way, but to resort to
	exaggeration in support of one party so that the heart is filled
	with spite and hatred against the other is an evil which no
	God-fearing person would commit. Those who indulge in such a thing
	against the clear teaching of the Qur'an, generally present the
	excuse that the Qur'an forbids to bear malice towards the believers
	and the ones towards whom they bear the malice were not believers
	but hypocrites. But this allegation is even worse than the sin in
	defense of which the excuse is presented. For these very verses of
	the Qur'an in the context of which Allah has taught the Muslims of
	the later generations not to bear malice towards the Muslims who
	have gone before them and to pray for their forgiveness, arc
	sufficient to refute this allegation. In these verses three groups
	have been mentioned, one after the other, who are entitled to
	receive a share in far. the Emigrants, the Ansar and the Muslims
	coming after them; and the Muslims of the later periods have been
	enjoined that they should pray for the forgiveness of the Muslims
	who had embraced the Faith before them. Obviously, in this context
	those who had embraced the Faith before them could not be any other
	than the Emigrants and the Ansar. Then Allah in vv. 11-17 of this
	Surah Al Hashr itself has. also told us who were the hypocrites.
	This makes it absolutely clear that the hypocrites were the people
	who had encouraged the Jews on the occasion of the battle of the
	Bani an-Nadir; as against them, the believers were those who were on
	the side of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) in this
	battle. After this, can a Muslim who has any fear of God in his
	heart, have the boldness to deny the Faith of the people to whose
	Faith Allah Himself has borne the testimony </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Imam
	Malik and Imam Ahmed arguing from this verse, have expressed ' the
	opinion that there is no share in fai for the people who malign the
	Companions of the Holy Prophet. (Ibn al-Arabi, Ahkam al-Quran;
	Ghayat al-Muntaha). But the Hanafis and the Shafe'is have not
	concurred with this, the reason being that Allah while declaring the
	three groups to be entitled to fai, has praised a conspicuous
	quality of each group but none of these qualities is a condition
	which may determine whether a group should or should not be given a
	share in fai. About the Emigrants it has been said: &quot;They seek
	Allah's bounty and His goodwill, and are ever ready to succor Allah
	and His Messenger.&quot; This does not mean that an Emigrant who
	lacks this quality, is not entitled to have a share in fai. About
	the Ansar it has been said: &quot;They love those who have migrated
	to them and entertain no desire in their hearts for what is given to
	them and prefer others about themselves even though they be needy
	themselves. &quot; This also does not mean that a member of the Amar
	who has no love for the Emigrants and who is desirous of getting for
	himself what is being given to them, has no share in fai. Therefore,
	the quality of the third group that &quot;they pray for the
	forgiveness of those who embraced the Faith before them and they
	pray that they should not have any malice in their hearts towards
	any other believer&quot;, is also no condition to make one entitled
	to fai, but this is in praise of a good quality and an instruction
	as to what should be the attitude of the believers towards the other
	believers and especially in respect of those believers who have gone
	before them.</FONT></FONT></P>

	the style of this whole section (vv. 11-17) it appears that it was

	within ten days, but had not yet laid siege to their quarters. As
	has been mentioned about, when the Holy Prophet save the notice to

	would come to their aid with two thousand men, and that the Bani

	therefore, they should stand firm and should never surrender to the

	person harbors the fear of another than God in his heart, it is in
	fact a negation of the fear of God. Obviously. the person who

	great truth has been expressed in this brief sentence. A person who
	has sense knows that the real power to be feared is the power of
	Allah and not the power of men. Therefore, he will avoid every such
	thing as may call for the punishment of Allah, whether there is any
	human power to call him to account for it or not, and he will come
	out to accomplish any duty which Allah has enjoined on him, whether
	he is opposed and hindered by all the powers of the world. But a
	man, who has no sense, determines his attitude and conduct in view
	of the human powers, instead of Allah's power, in all matters of
	lift, because Allah's power for him is imperceptible and human
	powers arc perceptible. If he avoids something. he will avoid it,
	not because of the fear of Allah's punishment for it, but because of
	a human power, which may be there to take him to task. And if he
	does something he will do is not because Allah has enjoined it, but
	because some human power has ordered or approved of it, and will
	reward hi for it. This very distinction between intelligence and
	folly, in fact, distinguishes the character and conduct of a
	believer from that of an unbeliever.&nbsp;

	refers to the second weakness of the hypocrites. The first weakness
	was that they were cowardly: they feared the men instead of fearing
	God and had no higher aim of lift before them like the believers,
	which might impel them to fight for it even at the cost of life. And
	their second weakness was that they had no common tic between them
	except hypocrisy, which might unite them together into a strong
	band. The only thing that had brought them together was that they
	were all feeling highly upset at the flourishing leadership and
	rulership of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings).
	who was an outsider in their city, and at the warm reception and
	help which their own compatriots the Ansar were giving the
	Emigrants. Because of this jealousy they wanted them to join hands
	together and in conspiracy with the enemies of Islam of the
	surrounding areas should somehow put an end to this alien power and
	authority. But apart from this negative objective there was no
	positive common aim to unify them. Each of their chiefs had his own
	separate band: each craved for his own leadership; no one was
	sincere to the other; but each bore such jealousy and malice for the

	they lay siege to the Bani an-Nadir, the leaders of the hypocrites
	would attack them from the rear with two thousand men, and also

	work. The third stage is taswir, which means to give shape; here it
	implies giving something its final complete shape. In all these
	three stages there is no resemblance whatever between Allah's work
	and human works. None of human plans is such as may not have been
	derived from previous models and plans. But each of Allah's plans
	is, unique and His own original creation. Whatever man makes, he
	makes it by combining the substances created by Allah. He does not
	bring anything from nonexistence into existence, but composes and
	constructs by different methods whatever is present and available.
	Contrary to this, Allah has brought everything from non-existence
	into creation, and the substance itself of which He has made the
	universe is created by Him. Likewise, in the matter of giving shape
	also man is not the inventor but an imitator, and only a poor
	imitator. The real Maker of forms and shapes is Allah, Who has given
	a unique and matchless shape to every species and individual and has
	never repeated exactly the same shape or from. &nbsp;
