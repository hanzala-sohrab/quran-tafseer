Surah is a matchless specimen of comprehensiveness and brevity. A
whole world of meaning has been compressed into its few brief words,
which is too vast in content to be fully expressed even in a book. In
it, in a clear and plain way it has been stated what is the way to
true success for man and what is the way to ruin and destruction for
him. Imam Shafi has very rightly said that if the people only
considered this Surah well, it alone would suffice them for their
guidance. How important this Surah was in the sight of the Companions
can be judged from the tradition cited from Hadrat Abdullah bin Hisn
ad-Darimi Abu Madinah, according to which whenever any two of them
met they would not part company until they had recited Surah Al-Asr
to each other. (Tabarani) </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>In
	this Surah an oath has been sworn by the Time to impress the point
	that man is in sheer loss and only those people are an exception
	from the loss who are characterized by four qualities: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Faith, 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	righteous deeds, 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
	exhorting one another to Truth, and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4)
	exhorting one another to patience. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Let us
	consider each of these parts separately in order to understand the
	meaning fully. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the oath, we have explained several times above that Allah has not
	sworn an oath by any of the created objects on account of its glory
	or its excellence and wonderful qualities but for the reason that it
	testifies to the truth which is meant to be established. Therefore,
	the oath by Time signifies that Time is witness to the truth that
	man is in sheer loss except for the people who possess the four
	qualities. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The word
	time is used for the past as well as for the passing time in which
	the present, in fact, does not signify any long stretch of time.
	Every moment, when it has passed, becomes past, and every moment of
	the future, when it is passing, becomes present, and when it has
	passed, becomes past. Here, since the oath has been sworn by time
	absolute, both kinds of time are included in its meaning. The oath
	by the past time means that human history .testifies that the people
	who were without these qualities, eventually incurred loss, and in
	order to understand the significance of the oath by the passing
	time, one should understand that the time which is now passing is,
	in fact, the time which has been given to every single individual
	and every single nation to work in the world. Its example is of the
	time which is allotted to a candidate for answering his
	question-paper in the examination hall. The speed with which this
	time is passing can be estimated from the movement of the
	second-hand in the watch. Even a second is a considerable amount of
	time, for during this very second light travels 186,000 miles, and
	in the Kingdom of God there may as well be many things which move
	even faster than light, but are net yet known to man. However, if
	the speed of the passing time be regarded the same as of the
	movement of the second-hand, and we consider that whatever act, good
	or bad, we perform and whatever occupation we pursue, takes place in
	the limited span of age that we have been given for work in the
	world, we feel that our real wealth is this very time, which is
	passing so quickly. Imam Razi has cited a scholar as saying: &quot;I
	understood the meaning of Surah Al-`Asr from an ice-seller, who was
	calling aloud for the attention of the people repeatedly in the
	bazaar: 'Have mercy on the one whose wealth is melting away !'
	Hearing what he was crying I said to myself: this then is the
	meaning of Wal- asr-i innal-insana la-fi khusr-in. The age-limit
	that man has been allotted is passing quickly&quot; like the melting
	away of ice. if it is wasted, or expended in wrong pursuits, it will
	be sheer loss to man. Thus, swearing an oath by the Time what has
	been said in this Surah, means that the fast passing Time is witness
	that devoid of these four qualities in whatever occupation and work
	man is expending his limited span of life, he is engaged in bad
	bargains; only such people are engaged in good bargains, who work in
	the world, characterized by the four qualities. It would be just
	like calling attention of the candidate, who was expending the time
	allotted for solving the question paper in some other pursuit, to
	the wall clock in the examination hall, to tell him that the passing
	time bore witness that he was causing loss to himself; the candidate
	benefiting by the Time was he who was using every moment of the
	allotted time in solving the paper.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Though
	the word Man has been used in the singular, in the following
	sentences those people have been made an exception from it, who are
	characterized by the four qualities. Therefore, one will have to
	admit that here the word Man has been used as a collective noun,
	denoting a class, and it applies equally to individuals, groups,
	nations, and entire mankind. Thus,. the general statement that
	whoever is devoid of the above four qualities, is in loss, would be
	proved in any case whether it is a person who is devoid of these, or
	a nation, or all men' of the world. It will be just like giving the
	verdict that poison is fatal for man; it will mean that poison is
	fatal in any case whether it is taken by an individual, or a nation,
	or all the people of the world. Poison's being fatal is an
	unchangeable truth; it dces not make any difference whether one man
	has taken it, or a nation has decided to take it, or all the people
	of the world collectively have agreed to take poison. Precisely in
	the same way this truth by itself is unchangeable that man's being
	devoid of the above foul qualities brings him loss. The general rule
	is not at all affected even if one man is devoid of these, or a
	nation, or all the people of the world agree that they would exhort
	one another to disbelief, immorality, falsehood and servitude to the
	self.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now, let
	us see in what sense has the Qur'an used the word khusr (loss).
	Lexically, khusr is an antonym of nafa ` (profit); in trade this
	word is used in the case when loss results from one bargain as well
	as in the case when the whole business is running in loss, and also
	in the case when man loses all his capital and becomes bankrupt. The
	Qur'an has made this word a special term of its own and uses it as
	an antonym of falah (true success). And just as its concept of falah
	is not merely synonymous with. worldly prosperity but comprehends
	man's true success from the world till the Hereafter, so its concept
	of khusr (loss) also is not merely synonymous with worldly failure
	or distress but comprehends man's real failure and disappointment
	from the world till the Hereafter. We have explained the Qur'anic
	concept of both falah and khusran at several places above which need
	not be repeated here. (For this please see E.N. 9 of Al-A`raf, E.N.
	30 of Al-Anfal, E.N. 23 of Yunus, E.N. 102 of Bani Isra'il, E.N. 17
	of Al-Hajj, E N.'s 1, 2, 11, 50 of AI-Mu'minun, E.N.4 of Luqman,
	E.N. 34 of Az-Zumar). Besides., one should also understand that
	although according to the Qur'an true success is man's success in
	the Hereafter and real loss his failure there, yet in this world too
	what the people describe as success is not, in fact, real success
	but its end in this world itself is failure, and what they regard as
	loss is not, in fact, loss but a means of true success even in this
	world. This truth has been stated by the Qur'an at several places
	and we have explained it everywhere accordingly. (Please see E.N. 99
	of An-Nahl E.N. 53 of Maryam, E.N. 105 of Ta Ha, E.N.'s 3-5 of
	Al-Lail). Thus, when the Qur'an states conclusively and absolutely
	that Man is certainly in loss, it implies loss both in this world
	and in the Hereafter; and when it says that only such people are
	secure from this loss, who are characterised by the four qualities,
	it implies their being secure from loss and attaining true success
	both here and in the Hereafter.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now, let
	us consider the four qualities on the existence of which depends
	man's being secure from loss and failure. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Of these
	the first quality is Iman (Faith). Although this word at some places
	in the Qur'an has been used in the meaning of only verbal
	affirmation of Faith (e.g. in An-Nisa': 137, AI-Ma'idah 54,
	Al-Anfal: 20, 27, At-Taubah: 38, As-Saff: 2) it has primarily been
	used in the meaning of believing sincerely and faithfully, and in
	the Arabic language also this word has this very meaning. Lexically,
	amanu lahu means saddaqa-hu wa `tamada 'alai-hi: &quot;affirmed him
	and put faith in him&quot;, and amana bi-hi means aiqana bi hi: &quot;had
	full faith in him.&quot; The Faith which the Qur'an regards as true
	Faith has been explained in the following verses: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;In
	fact, true believers are those who believed in Allah and His
	Messenger, then entertained no doubt.&quot; (Al-Hujurat: 15) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Those
	who said: 'Allah is our Lord', and then stood steadfast by it.&quot;
	(Ha Mim As-Sajdah : 30) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;True
	believers are those whose hearts tremble with awe, whenever Allah is
	mentioned to them. (AI-Anfal : 2). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Those
	who have believed adore Allah most ardently.&quot; (AI-Baqarah 165) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Nay,
	(O Prophet), by your Lord, they can never become believers until
	they accept you as judge for the decision of the disputes between
	them, and then surrender to your decision with entire submission
	without the least resentment in their hearts.&quot; (An-Nisa': 65).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	following verse is even more explicit as regards the distinction
	between verbal affirmation of Faith and true Faith; it says that
	what is actually desirable is true Faith and not mere verbal
	affirmation of the Faith: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;O
	you who profess to have believed, believe sincerely in Allah and His
	Messenger.&quot; (An-Nisa': 136) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the question, what has one to believe in, in order to have true
	faith? This also has been answered and explained in the Qur'an most
	explicitly. First, it implies that one has to believe in Allah, not
	merely in His Being but in the sense that He alone is God; no one
	else is an associate in His Godhead; He alone is worthy that man
	should worship, serve and obey Him; He alone can make or mar
	destinies; man should invoke Him alone and have trust in Him alone;
	He alone can enjoin things and forbid things; man is under
	obligation to obey Him and refrain from what he forbids; He sees
	everything and hears everything; not to speak of any act of man,
	even his motives and intentions with which he has done an act, are
	not hidden from Him. Secondly, one has to believe in the Messenger,
	in the sense that he is a guide and leader appointed by Allah:
	whatever he has taught, is from Allah, is based upon the truth and
	has to be acknowledged and accepted. This belief in Apostleship also
	includes faith in the angels, the Prophets, the Divine Books and in
	the Qur'an itself, for this forms part of the teachings which the
	Messenger of Allah has given. Thirdly, one has to believe in the
	Hereafter, in the sense that man's present life is not his first and
	last life, but after death man has to be resurrected, to render an
	account to God of the deeds done in the present life, and has to be
	rewarded for the good deeds and punished for the evil deeds
	accordingly. This Faith provides a firm basis for morality and
	character, upon which can be built the edifice of a pure life,
	whereas the truth is that without such Faith, the life of man,
	however beautiful and pleasing outwardly, is like a ship without an
	anchor, which is at the mercy of the waves wherever they may take
	it.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After
	Faith the second quality required to save man from loss is to
	perform righteous deeds (salihalt) Salihat comprehends all kinds of
	virtuous and good deeds. However, according to the Qur'an, no act
	can be a good act unless it is based on Faith and it is performed in
	obedience to the guidance given by Allah and His Messenger. That is
	why in the Qur'an exhortation to perform good deeds is preceded
	everywhere by Faith, and in this Surah too it has been mentioned
	after the Faith. Nowhere in the Qur'an has a deed without Faith been
	called a good deed, nor any reward promised for a deed performed
	without Faith. On the contrary, this also is a fact that only that
	Faith is reliable and beneficial, the sincerity of which is proved
	by man's own act and deed, otherwise Faith without righteous deeds
	would be a false claim refuted by the man himself when in spite of
	this claim he follows a way opposed to the way taught by Allah and
	His Messenger. The relationship between Faith and righteous deed is
	of the seed and the tree Unless the seed is sown in the soil no tree
	can grow out of it. But if the seed is in the soil and no tree is
	growing out of it, it would mean that the seed is lost in the soil.
	On this very basis whatever good news has been given in the Qur'an,
	has been given to the people who believe and do good deeds, and the
	same has been reiterated in this Surah. What man requires to do
	after the Faith in order to remain secure from loss is to perform
	righteous deeds. In other words, mere Faith without righteous deeds
	cannot save man from loss.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The above
	two qualities are such as must be possessed by every single
	individual. Then, the Surah mentions two further qualities, which a
	man must have in order to be saved from loss. They are that the
	people who believe and do good deeds must exhort one another to
	truth and to patience. This means that. in the first place, a
	believing and righteous people should not live as individuals but
	should create a believing and righteous society by their
	combination. Second, that every individual of this society must feel
	his responsibility not to let the society become degenerate. Thus,
	all its members are duty bound to exhort one another to truth and to
	patience.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Truth is
	the antonym of falsehood, and generally it is used in , two
	meanings: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) A
	correct and right thing which is in accordance with justice and
	truth, whether it relates to belief and faith or to mundane affairs;
	and 
	</P>

	right which is obligatory on man to render, whether it is the right
	of God, the right of man, or the right of one's own self. Thus, to
	exhort one another to truth means that the society of the believers
	should not be so insensitive that falsehood may thrive and things
	against justice and truth be done in it, and the people be watching
	everything indifferently. On the contrary, it should be a living,
	sensitive society so that whenever and wherever falsehood appears,
	the upholders of the Truth should rise up against it, and no member
	of the society rest content with only himself adhering to truth,
	righteousness, justice and rendering the rights of others, but
	should exhort others also to adopt the same way of life. This is the
	spirit that can ensure security of a society against moral
	degeneration and decay. If a society becomes devoid of this spirit,
	it cannot remain secure from loss, and eventually even those people
	also are affected by the loss, who might in their own way be
	adhering to the truth, but were insensitive to violation of the
	truth in their society.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The same
	has been stated in Al-Ma'idah, thus: &quot;Those who adopted the way
	of disbelief among the children of Israel were cursed by the tongue
	of David and of Jesus, son of Mary, because they had grown
	rebellious and become transgressors: they would not forbid one
	another to do the wrong deeds they committed. (w. 78-79). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then the
	same idea has been expressed in Al-A`raf, thus: &quot;When the
	children of Israel totally forgot the teachings (of observing the
	Sabbath), We seized with a severe scourge all those who were
	transgressors, and We saved those who used to forbid evil&quot; (v.
	165); and in Surah Al-Anfal, thus: &quot;And guard against that
	mischief which will not bring punishment in particular to the
	mischief-makers alone from among you.&quot; (v. 25) That is why to
	enjoin what is good and to forbid what is evil, has been enjoined on
	the Muslim community as a duty (Al-`Imran 104) and the community
	which performs this duty has been declared to be the best community
	(Al-`Imran: 110). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides
	exhorting to the truth, the other thing which has been declared as a
	necessary condition for keeping the believers and their society
	secure from loss is that the members of the society should enjoin
	patience upon one another. That is, they should enjoin upon one
	another to bear with fortitude and steadfastness the difficulties,
	hardships, trials, losses and deprivations which befall the one who
	adheres to the truth and supports it. Each one of them should
	encourage the other to bear up against adversity steadfastly. (For
	further explanation, see E.N. 16 of Ad-Dahr, E.N. 14 of Al-Balad).
