<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Its
theme is to exhort the Muslims to adopt sincerity in Faith and to
struggle with their lives in the cause of Allah. It is addressed to
the Muslims with weak faith as well as those who had entered Islam
with a false profession of the Faith and also those who were sincere
in their profession. Some verses are addressed to the first two
groups, some only to the hypocrites, and some only to the sincere
Muslims. The style itself shows where one particular group has been

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 5-7 the people of the Holy Prophet's community have been warned
that their attitude towards their Messenger and their Religion should
not be like the attitude that the Israelites had adopted towards the
Prophets Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them). In spite of
acknowledging the Prophet Moses as a Messenger of God they continued
to malign him as long as he lived, and in spite of witnessing clear
signs from the Prophet Jesus they denied him without any hesitation.
Consequently, the Israelites became perverse, incapable of benefiting
from divine guidance. This is certainly not an enviable state which
another nation should imitate. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>This
	is a brief introduction to this discourse. For its explanation, see
	E.N.'s 1,2 of Surah Al-Hadid. The discourse has been opened with
	this introduction so that before hearing or reading what is going to
	follow, one may well understand that Allah is free from and far
	above this that the functioning of His Godhead should depend on
	someone s faith and another one's help and sacrifices. If He exhorts
	the believers to adopt sincerity in Faith and urges them to exert
	their utmost for the success and victory of the Truth, that is for
	the sake of their own good; otherwise the will of Allah is
	accomplished by His own power and by His own design, whether
	somebody makes no effort at all towards its implementation, and
	whether the whole world joins together to frustrate and resist it
	stubbornly.&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote2">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>One
	meaning of this passage is general as is apparent from its words. It
	has a special meaning also, which becomes evident when this verse is
	read along with the verse that follows. The first meaning is that
	there should be complete agreement between a true Muslim's word and
	deed: he should carry into effect whatever he says, and when he has
	no intention of doing it, or has no power for it, he should not say
	it. To say one thing and do another is one of the most hideous
	characteristics of man, in the sight of Allah. The Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be Allah's peace) has explained that a person's being
	characterized by this quality is a sign that he is not a believer
	but a hypocrite. According to a .Hadith he said; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	hypocrite has three signs even if he offered the Prayer and observed
	the Fast, and professed to be a Muslim: That then he spoke he lied;
	when he made a promise, he broke it; and when he was entrusted with
	something, he proved dishonest. &quot; (Bukhari, Muslim) . 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In
	another Hadith he said: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Four
	characteristics are such that the one who has all the four, is a
	hypocrite through and through, and the one who has one of these, has
	one characteristic of hypocrisy in him until he gives it up: that
	when he is entrusted with something, he proves dishonest; when he
	speaks, he lies; when he makes a promise, he breaks it; and when he
	quarrels he crosses all limits of morality and decency.&quot;
	(Bukhari, Muslim). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	jurists of Islam have almost unanimously held the view that if a
	person makes a pledge to Allah (e.g.. vows to do some thing), or
	enters an agreement with others, or promised somebody to do
	something, it is obligatory for him to fulfil it, unless the thing
	he has promised is by itself sinful. If it is sinful, he should not
	observe or carry out the agreement or promise, but should expiate
	its violation as mentioned in Surah AI-Ma'idah: 89 above. (AI-Jassas
	and Ibn al'Arabi, Ahkam al-Qur-an an). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This much
	for the general meaning of these verses. As for their special
	meaning, it becomes obvious when these are read along with the verse
	that follows. The object is to reprove those people who talked much
	and made tall promises to fight and lay down their lives in the
	cause of Islam, but when the time came of their test and trial, they
	fled the battlefield. The people of weak faith have been taken to
	task for this weakness at several places in the Qur'an. For
	instance, in Surah An-Nisa': 77, it has been said: &quot;Have you
	also marked those to whom if was said, 'Withhold your hands (a while
	from war) and establish the salat and pay the zakat. Now that they
	have been commanded to fight, some of them fear the people as they
	should fear Allah, or even more than that. They say: 'Our Lord, why
	have You prescribed fighting for us? Why have You not given us
	further respite?&quot; And in Surah Muhammad: 20: &quot;Those who
	have believed, were saying, 'Why is not a Surah sent down (to enjoin
	fighting)?' But when a decisive Surah was sent down in which
	fighting had been mentioned, you saw those in whose hearts was a
	disease, looking towards you like the one under the shadow of
	death.' On the occasion of the Battle of Uhud in particular, the
	weaknesses to which allusions have been made continuously from verse
	121 to verse 171 of Surah Al-'Imran became all the more conspicuous
	and visible. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	commentators while explaining the background of the revelation of
	these verses have mentioned the different forms of the weaknesses to
	which exception has been taken here. Ibn 'Abbas says that before the
	fighting was proscribed, there were some people among the Muslims
	who said: &quot;Would that we could know the act that is most
	lovable in the sight of Allah, so that we would perform the same.&quot;
	But when they were told that it was fighting in the cause of Allah,
	it became most difficult for them to carry out their promise.
	Muqatil bin Hayyan has stated that in the Battle of Uhud these very
	people were put to the test, and they abandoned the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be Allah's peace) and fled Ibn Zaid says that many of the
	people made the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) believe that they
	would go out with him to fact the enemy whenever it was so required,
	but when the time of the test came their promises proved false.
	Qatadah and Dahhak say that if some people did take pan in the
	battle, they accomplished nothing. but on their return from the
	battlefield they boasted and bragged, saying. &quot;We put up a
	brave fight and we achieved such and such a victory.&quot; It is
	such people who have been rebuked by Allah in these verses.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>That
	is, it is not Allah's way to force the people to follow the right
	way of guidance if they are bent upon following the crooked ways of
	sin and disobedience. From this it automatically follows that the
	deviation of a person or nation is not initiated by Allah but by the
	person or the nation itself. But the law of Allah is that He
	provides means of deviation only for the one who chooses deviation,
	so that be may go astray into whatever alleys he may like. Allah has
	granted man the freedom of choice. Now it is for every man and for
	every group of men to decide whether he or it wants to obey their
	Lord, or not, and whether he or it chooses the right way for it or
	one of the crooked ways. There is no compulsion from Allah in this
	choice. If somebody chooses the way of obedience and guidance, Allah
	does not push him forcibly towards deviation and disobedience; and
	if somebody is resolved to follow disobedience instead of the way of
	righteousness, it is not Allah's way to make him adopt the way of
	obedience and guidance forcibly. But this also is the truth that the
	person who chooses a particular way for himself, cannot follow it
	practically unless Allah provides for him the ways and means and
	creates for him the conditions which are necessary for following it.
	This is Allah's grace and favor&quot; without which no one's efforts
	can be meaningful and productive. Now, if a person is not at all
	interested in seeking Allah's grace for righteousness, but seeks His
	grace for adopting evil, he is given the same. And when he receives
	the grace for doing evil. he becomes temperamentally perverse
	accordingly and the course of his action and effort goes on becoming
	crooked until at last the capability to do and accept good in him is
	gradually lost and destroyed. This is what is meant by, when they
	adopted perverseness, Allah caused their hearts to become perverse.&quot;
	In this state it is against the law of Allah that the one who wants
	to adopt deviation, and is actively and earnestly engaged in seeking
	it, and is expending all one's thought and energy to move further
	and further on towards it, should be forcibly turned towards
	guidance, for such an action would negate the object of the test and
	.trial, for which man has been granted the freedom of choice in the
	world. For if a man adopts righteousness through such guidance,
	there is no reason why he should be entitled to any reward whatever.
	Rather in such a case, the one who was not guided forcibly and was
	left in deviation on that account, should not be subjected to any
	punishment, for the responsibility for his deviation would lie on
	Allah, and at the time of his accountability in the Hereafter, he
	could present the argument: '`When there existed the rule of
	granting guidance forcibly in the world, why was I deprived of that
	favor?&quot; This is the meaning of the words: &quot;Allah does not
	guide the transgressors.&quot; That is, Allah does not grant the
	favor of adopting the way of obedience to those, who have chosen the
	way of sin and disobedience for themselves of their own free will.

	</P>

	answer to the good news that is there in the Torah about my advent.

	as the one whose coming had been foretold by the former Prophets.&quot;
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	Third meaning becomes obvious when the sentence is read along with
	the sentence which follows it and it is this: &quot;I confirm the
	good news given by the Torah about the coming of Allah's Messenger,
	named Ahmad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings), and give the
	good news of his coming myself.&quot; According to this third
	meaning. this saying of the Prophet Jesus (peace be on him) alludes
	to the good news which the Prophet Moses (peace be on him) had given
	to his people about the advent of the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon
	whom be Allah's peace). In it he says: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of
	thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.
	According to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb in
	the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of
	the Lord my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I
	die not. And the Lord said unto me, They have well spoken that which
	they have spoken- I will raise them up a Prophet from among their
	brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he
	shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it shall
	come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he
	shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.&quot; (Deut. 18:
	15-19). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is
	an express prophecy of the Torah, which applies to none but the Holy
	Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings). In it
	the Prophet Moses is conveying to his people this direction of
	Allah: &quot;I will raise up for you a Prophet from among your
	brethren&quot;. Obviously, the &quot;brethren&quot; of a nation
	cannot be a tribe or a family of the nation itself, but another
	nation to which it is related racially. If it had implied the coming
	of a Prophet from among the children of Israel themselves, the words
	would have been to the effect: &brvbar;I shall raise up a Prophet
	for you from among yourselves.&quot; Hence, the &quot;brethren of
	the Israelites' can inevitably imply the Ishmaelites, who are their
	relatives by lineage, being the children of the Prophet Abraham
	(peace be on him). Moreover, no Israelite Prophet can correspond to
	this prophecy for the reason also that not one but many Prophets
	appeared among the Israelites after the prophet Moses and the Bible
	is replete with their history. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	thing foretold in the prophecy is that the Prophet to be raised up
	would be `like into the Prophet Moses&quot;. This obviously does not
	imply that he would resemble the Prophet Moses in physical features
	or circumstances of life, for in this respect no individual can ever
	be like another individual; it also does not mean the resemblance in
	the characteristics of Prophethood, for this characteristic is
	common to all those _Prophets, who came after the Prophet Moses.
	Therefore. no Prophet can have this quality that he should be like
	unto him in this characteristic Thus, resemblance in these two
	aspects becomes out of the question. The only aspect of resemblance
	on the basis of which the peculiarity of a Prophet of the future
	becomes understandable is that that Prophet should be a bearer of
	Divine Law like the Prophet Moses. And this peculiarity is found in
	none but the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
	blessings), for all the Prophets who appeared before him among the
	Israelites were the followers of the Law of Moses; none of them had
	brought a permanent Divine Law of his own. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	interpretation is further strengthened by these words of the
	prophecy. 'According to all that thou (i.e. the Israelites)
	desiredst of the Lord thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly,
	saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the Lord thy God, neither
	let me see this great fire any more, that I die not. And the Lord
	said unto them, They have well spoken that which they have spoken. I
	will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto
	thee, and will put my words in his mouth.&quot; In this passage
	Horeb means the mountain on which the Prophet Moses had received the
	Divine Law first of all, and the prayer that the Israelites made
	was: &quot;If we are given a Divine Law in the further, it should
	not be given us under the dreadful conditions like those which were
	created at the foot of Mt. Horeb while giving us the Law.&quot;
	These conditions have been mentioned both in the Qur'an and in the
	Bible. (See Al-Baqarah: 55, 56, 63; AI-A'raf: 155, 171. Bible:
	Exodus, 19: 17- 18). In answer to it, the Prophet Moses tells the
	Israelites; 'Allah has granted your prayer. Ho says that He will
	raise up a Prophet for you, in whose mouth He will put His own
	words.&quot; That is, at the time of bestowing the Dew Divine Law,
	He will not create the dreadful conditions which were created at the
	foot of Mt. Horeb. Instead of that, Divine Words will be put in the
	mouth of the Prophet who would be appointed to that office, ant he
	will recite those Words before the people. A study of this
	explanation leaves no room for the doubt that the prophecy applies
	to another than the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace).
	Only he after the Prophet Moses has been granted an enduring and
	permanent Divine Law. At its bestowal no assembly of the people was
	called as was called of the Israelites at the foot of Mt. Horeb, and
	no such conditions were created during the) time it was bestowed as
	were created in their case there.&nbsp;

	In order to determine the exact meaning of these passages one should
	first know that the language spoken by the Prophet Jesus and his
	contemporary Palestinians was a dialect of the Aramaic language,
	called Syriac. More than 200 years before the birth of Jesus when
	the Seleucides came to power Hebrew bad become extinct in this
	territory and been replaced by Syriac. Although under the influence
	of the Seleucide and then the Roman empires, Grace also had reached
	this area, it remained confined only to that class of the people,
	who after having access to the higher government circles, or in
	order to seek access to them, had become deeply Hellenized. The
	Common Palestinians used a particular dialect of Syriac, the accents
	and pronunciations and idioms of which were different from the
	Syriac spoken in and around Damascus. The common people of the
	country were wholly unaware of Greek. So much so that when in A.D.
	70 the Roman Genera( Titus, after taking Jerusalem, addressed the
	citizens in Greek, he had to be translated into Syriac, This makes
	it evident that whatever the Prophet Jesus spoke to his disciples
	must necessarily be only in Syriac. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Secondly,
	one should know that all the four Gospels contained In the Bible
	were written by the reek-speaking Christians, who had entered
	Christianity after the Prophet Jesus. The traditions of the sayings
	and acts of the Prophet Jesus reached them through the Syriac
	speaking Christians not in the written form but as oral traditions,
	and they translated these Syriac traditions into their own language
	and incorporated them in their books. None of the extant Gospels was
	written before 70; the Gospel of St. John was compiled n century
	after the Prophet Jesus probably in Ephesus, a city in Asia Minor.
	Moreover, no original copy even of these Gospels in Greek, in which
	these were originally written, exists. None of the Greek manuscripts
	that have been discovered and collected from here and there and
	which all belong to the period before the inventions of printing
	dates before the 4th century. Therefore, it is difficult to say what
	changes might have taken place in these during the first three
	centuries What makes it particularly doubtful is that the Christians
	have been regarding it as quite lawful to romper with their Gospels
	intentionally as and when they liked. The author of the article
	&quot;Bible&quot; in Encyclopedia Britannica (Ed. 19731 writes: </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&ldquo;The
	main source of the evidence and of the variations are the
	manuscripts of the N.T., dating from the and to the 10th century or
	even later. In the process of copying, these manuscripts underwent
	the revisions that necessitate textual criticism. Some of these
	revisions were unintentional, as the scribe skipped a word or a line
	or as he mistook one character for another. Other revisions came
	from the desire of the scribe to harmonize the text of one Gospel

	Keeping these un-deniable historical facts in mind let us consider
	the fact that in the passages cited from St. John's Gospel above,
	the Prophet Jesus (peace be on him) is giving the news about one
	coming after him, about whom he says: &quot;He will be `the prince
	of this world' (Sarwar `Alam) &quot;he shall abide with you for
	ever,&quot; &quot;he will guide you into all truth,&quot; and &ldquo;he
	shall testify of me&quot; (i.e. of Jesus himself). By interpolating
	words like &quot;the Holy Ghost&quot; and &quot;the Spirit of
	truth&quot;, `in the passages of St. John. every effort hag been
	made to corrupt the real meaning, but despite that if these passages
	are read carefully, one can clearly see that the one whose coming
	has been foretold, will not be a spirit but a man, and an
	extraordinary man, whose teaching will be universal, all pervasive
	and enduring till the Last Day. For this particular person the word
	'Madadgar&quot; (helper) has been used in the Urdu translation, and
	the Greek word used in St John's original Gospel, according to the
	Christians, was Peracletus. But the Christian scholars themselves
	have been faced with great difficulties in determining its meaning.
	In the original Greek Paraclete has several meanings: to call to a
	particular place, to call for help, to warn, to tempt and incite, to
	implore and pray. Moreover, in Hellenic sense, it gives these
	meanings: to console, to give satisfaction, to encourage. Wherever
	this word has been used in the Bible, it does pot fit in well with
	the context anywhere. Origen has translated it Consolateor at some
	places and Deprecator at others. But the other commentators have
	rejected both these translations, for in the first place these are
	not correct according to Greek grammar; second, these meanings do
	not go well with context wherever this word has occurred in the
	passages. Some other translators have translated it Teacher, but
	this meaning too, cannot be derived from the Greek usage, Tertullian
	and Augustine have preferred the word Advocate, and some other
	scholars have adopted words like Assistant, Comforter, Cosoler, etc.
	(See Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature under &quot;Peracletus&quot;).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(6)
	Now, it is interesting to note that in Greek itself there is another
	word periclytos, which means &quot;the Praised One&quot;. This word
	is exactly synonymous with `Muhammad&quot;. In pronunciation it
	closely resembles Peracletus. It cannot be a remote possibility that
	the Christians who have been used to making alterations in their
	religious books as and when they liked, might have effected e little
	variation in the spelling of this word in the prophecy related by
	St. John when they saw that it went against their set belief and
	creed. The original Greek Gospel composed by St. John does not exist
	either; therefore it is not possible to check which of the two words
	had actually been used in it. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(7)
	But the decision is not solely dependent on this as to which word
	had St. John actually used in Greek, for in any case that too was, a
	translation and the Prophet Jesus language, as we have explained
	above, was Palestinian Syriac. Therefore, the word that he might
	have used in his good news must necessarily be a Syriac word.
	Fortunately, we find that original Syriac word in the Life of
	Muhammad by Ibn Hisham. Along with that we also come to know its
	synonymous Greek word from the same book. Ibn Hisham, on the
	authority of Ibn Ishaq, has reproduced the complete translation of
	15: 23-27 and of 16:1 of the Gospel according to yuhannus (Yuhanna:
	John), and has used the Syriac word Munhamanna instead of the Greek
	Paraclete. Then, Ibn Ishaq or Ibn Hisham has explained it this: The
	Munhamanna in Syriac means Muhammad and in Greek the Peracletus.
	(Ibn Hisham, vol. 1, p. 248). </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now,
	historically, the Historical of the common Palestinian Christians
	until the 9th century A.D. was Syriac. This land was included in the
	Islamic territories in the first half of the 7th century. Ibn Ishaq
	died in 768 A.D. and Ibn Hisham in 828 A.D. This means that in the
	time of both the Palestinian Christians spoke Syriac, and for
	neither it was difficult to have contacts with the Christian
	subjects of their country. Moreover, in those days there also lived
	hundreds of thousands of Greek speaking Christians in the Islamic
	territories. Therefore, It was also not difficult for them to find
	out which particular word of Greek was synonymous with a certain
	word of Syriac. Now, if in the translation reproduced by Ibn Ishaq
	the Syriac word Munhamanna has been used, and Ibn Ishaq or Ibn
	Hisham has explained that its Arabic equivalent is Muhammad and
	Greek Peracletus, there remains no room for the doubt that the
	Prophet Jesus had given the good news of the coming of the Holy
	Prophet himself by name. Along with that it also becomes known that
	in the Greek Gospel of John the word actually used was Periclytos.
	which the Christian scholars changed into Peracletus at some later
	time. </FONT></FONT>

	Even an older historical evidence in this connection is the
	following tradition from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud: </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'When
	the Negus summoned the Emigrants from Makkah to his court and heard
	the teachings of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) from
	Hadrat Ja'far bin Abi Talib, he said; &ldquo;God bless you and him
	from whom you have come! I bear witness that he is Messenger of
	Allah, and he is the same one whose mention we find in the Gospel,
	and the same one good news about whom had been given by Jesus son of
	Mary.&rdquo; (Musnad Ahmad This has been related in Hadih from
	Hadrat Ja'far himself and also from Hadrat Umm Salamah. This not
	only proves that in the beginning of the 7th century the Negus knew
	that the Prophet Jesus had foretold the coming of a Prophet, but
	also that a clear pointer to 'that prophet&quot; existed in the
	Gospel on the basis of which the Negus did not take long to from the
	opinion that the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
	blessings) was that prophet. However, from this tradition one cannot
	know whether the source of information with the Negus about the good
	news given by the Prophet Jesus was this same Gospel of St. John, or
	whether there existed some other means also at that time for this
	information. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(9)
	The truth is that the four Gospels which the Christian Church has
	recognized as Canonical are neither an authentic means of knowing
	the Prophet Jesus Prophecies about the Holy Prophet nor are they a
	reliable source for knowing the correct biography and the original
	teachings of the Prophet Jesus himself, but by far the more
	trust-worthy means for this is the Gospel of Barnabas which the
	Church has declared as heretical and apocryphal. The Christians have
	done whatever they could to conceal it, and it remained lost to the
	world for centuries. In the 16th century only one copy of its
	Italian translation existed in the library of Pope Sixtus V, and no
	one was allowed to read it. In the beginning of the 18th century it
	came into the hands of one John Toland. Then, changing different
	hands it found its way in 1738 into the Imperial Library of Vienna,
	In 1907 an English translation of this Italian manuscript was
	printed at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, but probably soon after its
	printing the Christian world realized that the book cut at the very
	root of the Faith which was attributed to the Prophet Jesus.
	Therefore, its printed copies were destroyed somehow, and then it
	never went into print any more. Another copy of it, a Spanish
	translation from the Italian manuscript, existed in the 18th
	century, which has been mentioned by George Sale in his Preface and
	Preliminary Discourse to the English translation of the Qur'an. This
	too was made to disappear, and no trace of it exists anywhere today.
	j had a chance to see a copy of the English translation published
	from Oxford and I have read it word by word. I feel that it is
	indeed a great blessing of which the Christians have kept themselves
	deprived only out of prejudice and stubbornness.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Wherever
	this Gospel is mentioned in Christian literature, it ill condemned
	as a forged Gospel, which perhaps some Muslim has composed and
	ascribed to Barnabas. But this is a great falsehood which has been
	uttered only for the reason that it contains at several places clear
	prophecies about the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
	peace and blessings). In the first place, a perusal of this Gospel
	shows that it could not have been written by a Muslim. Secondly, had
	it been written by a Muslim, it would have spread extensively among
	the Muslims and the writings of the Islamic scholars would have
	contained plentiful references to it. On the contrary. the Muslims
	had no knowledge of its existence before George Sale wrote his
	Preliminary Discourse to his translation of the Qur'an. No mention
	of any kind is found of the Gospel of Barnabas in the books of the
	Muslim writers like Tabari, Yaqubi, Mas'udi, Al-Benrni, Ibn Hazm and
	others, who were fully conversant with Christian literature when
	they discuss Christianity The best catalogs of the books found in
	the libraries of the Islamic world were Al-Fihrist of Ibn an-Nadim
	and Kashfas-Zunnun of Haji-Khalifah, and these too are without any
	mention of it. No Muslim scholar before the 19th century has ever
	mentioned the name of the Gospel of Barnabas, The third and most
	important argument to refute the claim that the Gospel has been
	written by a Muslim is that about 75 years before the birth of the
	Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), In the time of Pogo Gelasius I,
	the list prepared of canonical books, which were banned for reading
	by a Papal decree also included the Gospel of Barnabas (Evangelium
	Barnabe). The question is: Who was the Muslim at that time, who
	forged this Gospel? The Christian scholars themselves have admitted
	that the Gospel of Barnabas remained prevalent in Syria, Spain,
	Egypt, etc. during the early days of Christianity for a long time
	and that it was banned as heretical in the 6th century.</FONT></FONT></P>

	Before we reproduce the good news given by the Prophet Jesus about
	the advent of the Holy Prophet from this Gospel, it would be useful
	to Introduce it briefly so that the reader may know its importance
	and also understand why the Christians are so angry with it.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>None
	of the writers of the four Gospels which have been included in the
	Bible as authentic and canonical, was a companion of the Prophet
	Jesus, and none of them has either made the claim that the
	information recorded by him in his Gospel was obtained from the
	companions of the Prophet Jesus, They have, in fact, made no mention
	of the sources from which they obtained their information, which
	could show whether the reporter himself witnessed the events and
	heard the sayings that he was describing or whether they reached him
	through one or more than one transmitters. On the contrary, the
	author of the Gospel of Barnabas states that he is one of the
	original twelve disciples of Jesus, that he followed Jesus from the
	beginning till the end, and that he is recording the events that be
	witnessed with his own eyes and the sayings that he heard with his
	own ears. Not only this. In the end of the Book he says that on his
	departure from the world the Prophet Jesus had made him responsible
	for removing the prevalent misunderstandings about himself and for
	informing the world of the correct events.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Who
	was this Barnabas? In the Acts of the Apostles a person so named is
	very frequently mentioned. He came of a Jewish family of Cyprus. He
	has been praised for his services in connection with the preaching
	of Christianity and rendering help and assistance to the followers
	of the Christ. But nowhere has it been told as to when ho embraced
	Christianity; his name does not either appear in the list of the
	twelve original disciples, which has been given in the three
	Gospels. Therefore, one cannot say that the author of this Gospel is
	the same Barnabas or some other person. The list of the disciples
	given by Barnabas differs from the one given by Matthew and Mark
	only in two names: Thomas instead of whom Barnabas has given his own
	name and Simon the Canaanite instead of whom he has named Judas son
	of Jacob. In the Gospel of Luke this second name is also there.
	Therefore, it would be correct to assume that some time later only
	in order to exclude Barnabas from the disciples the name of Thomas
	was included so as to be rid of his Gospel. To effect such changes
	in their scriptures has never been anything unlawful with the
	Christian scholars.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If
	one goes through the Gospel with an unbiased mind and compares it
	with the four Gospels of the New Testament, one cannot help feeling
	that it is far superior to them. In it the events of the life of the
	Prophet Jesus (peace be on him) have been described in much greater
	detail, in a manner as though somebody was actually witnessing what
	was happening and was himself a partner in those events. As against
	the incoherent stories of the four Gospels this historical account
	is more coherent. From it one can fully well understand the series
	of events unfolding themselves. In it the teachings of the Prophet
	Jesus have been given in a clearer, more effective and expanded form
	than in the other Gospels. The themes of the Unity of God,
	refutation of polytheism, attributes of God, essence of worship and
	morality have been presented in a most forceful, rational and
	exhaustive way. In the other Gospels one does not find even a
	fraction of the instructive parables which clothe the themes This
	Gospel also shows in much greater detail what wist methods the
	Prophet Jesus used for the teaching and training of his disciples.
	Anyone who has any acquaintance with the language, style and
	temperament of the Prophet Jesus will be compelled to admit after a
	perusal of this Gospel that it is not a fictitious document, which
	might have been forged in a later period. But the truth is that in
	it the Prophet Jesus appears before us in his true grandeur and
	glory much more conspicuously than anywhere in the four canonical
	Gospels. In it there is no trace of those contradictions which
	abound in the four Gospels in respect of his different sayings.</FONT></FONT></P>

	the Gospel of Barnabas the life of the Prophet Jesus and his
	teachings are found precisely according to the life and teachings of
	a Prophet of God. He presents himself as a Prophet, and confirms all
	the former Prophets and Books. He clearly states that there is no
	other means of knowing the truth except through the teachings of the
	Prophets, and the one who abandons the Prophets, in fact, abandons
	God. He presents the doctrines of the Unity of God, Prophethood, and
	the Hereafter precisely as taught by all the Prophets. He exhorts
	the people to perform the Prayer, observe the Fast and pay the
	Zakat. The description that Barnabas has given of his Prayers at a
	number of places shows that the times he observed for his Prayers
	were the same times of Fajr (Dawn), Zuhr (Early afternoon), `Asr
	(Late afternoon), Maghrib, 'Isha (Late Evening) and Tahajjud (Before
	Dawn), and he always performed his ablutions before the Prayer.. He
	acknowledged David and Solomon as the Prophets, although the Jews
	and Christians have excluded them from the list of the Prophets. He
	regarded the Prophet Ishmael as the intended victim of the
	sacrifice, and he makes a Jewish rabbi admit that the intended
	victim was indeed the Prophet Ishmael, and not the Prophet Isaac, as

	The reason why the Christians have become opponents of the Gospel of
	Barnabas is not that it contains clear and definite good news about

	Jews only in that they had affirmed faith in the Prophet Jesus as
	the Messiah (the Christ) whereas the Jews had refused to acknowledge
	him as the Messiah. Later, when St. Paul entered this community, he
	started preaching and proclaiming this religion also to the Romans
	and the Greeks as well as other non-Jewish and non-Israelite
	communities.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For
	this purpose he invented an altogether new religion, the beliefs,
	doctrines and injunctions of which were entirely different from
	those taught by the Prophet Jesus. This man had never met the
	Prophet Jesus but was a bitter enemy of him during his lifetime, and
	even remained an enemy of his followers for several years after him.
	Then, when he entered his community and started inventing a new
	religion, he did not cite any saying of Jesus as his authority but
	based everything on his own inspiration. The only object before him
	while framing the new religion was to make it acceptable to the
	gentile world. He declared .that a Christian was free from all
	restrictions of the Jewish Law. He abolished all restrictions of the
	lawful and the unlawful in food. He repudiated the circumcision,
	which was particularly disagreeable to the non-Jewish world. So much
	so that he innovated the doctrine of the divinity of Christ and his
	being son of God and the Atonement for the original sin of mankind
	by dying on the Cross, for it immensely suited the polytheistic
	taste of the common man. The early followers of Christ resisted
	these innovations, but the flood gate opened by St. Paul caused a
	huge multitude of the non-Jewish Christians to enter this religion
	against whom the handful of we Christians could not stand for long.
	However, until about the end of the 3rd century A.D. there were
	still many people who denied the divinity of Christ. But in the
	beginning of the 4th century (in 325 A.D.) the Nicaea Council
	recognized the Pauline doctrines and admitted them as the basis of
	Christianity. Then the Roman Empire itself turned Christian and in
	the reign of Emperor Theodosius Christianity became the start
	religion. Consequently, all the books that clashed with this
	doctrine were declared as heretical, and only those books were held
	as canonical which agreed with it. In 367 A.D. for the first time a
	collection of reliable and accepted books was issued by an epistle
	of Athanaseus, which was ratified in 382 A.D. in a meeting under
	Pope Damasius. Towards the end of the 5th century Pope Gelasius
	confirming this collection as authentic also issued a list of the
	books which were &quot;spurious&quot;, whereas no Christian scholar
	has ever made the c]aim that any of the Pauline doctrines which were
	made the criterion foe declaring certain religious books as
	authentic and others as not authentic, had been taught by the
	Prophet Jesus himself. More than that, even in the Gospels which are
	admitted to the canonical collection no saying of the Prophet Jesus
	himself is recorded, which may confirm these doctrines. </FONT></FONT>

	says that during the lifetime of Jesus, first of all the

	repudiated this false belief about himself repeatedly and cursed
	those who spoke thus of him. Then he sent his disciples throughout
	Judea to refute it and blessed them also with the ability to work
	the sate miracles which issued from himself, so that the people be
	made to give up the false idea that the one who performed those
	miracles was God or son of God. In this connection he reproduces the
	full discourses of the Prophet Jesus in which he repudiated this
	false belief and tells how upset he was at the circulation of this
	mischief. Moreover, he strongly refutes the Pauline doctrine that
	Christ died on the Cross. He narrates as an eye-witness that when
	Judas Iscariot took money from the high priest and brought soldiers
	to have Jesus arrested, four angels at Allah Almighty's command
	carried him away and Judas was so changed in speech and in face as
	to be like Jesus. Thus, it was he who was put on the cross and not
	Jesus. Thus, this Gospel cuts at the root of Pauline Christianity

	before the revelation of the Qur'an, the Christian priests had
	rejected it on account of these very assertion. </FONT></FONT>

	The above discussion makes it abundantly clear that the Gospel of
	Barnabas is, in fact, a more reliable Gospel than the so-called
	canonical Gospels. It represents the Prophet Jesus' teachings and
	the events and deeds of his life and his sayings correctly; it s the
	Christian people's own misfortune that they have lolly only because
	of their stubbornness the opportunity they were given to correct
	their beliefs and to know the real teachings of the Prophet Jesus.
	Now we can quote with full satisfaction the glad tidings about the
	Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings),
	which Barnabas has reported from the Prophet Jesus. In these glad
	tidings at some places the Prophet Jesus mentions the Holy Prophet
	by name, at some he calls him Rasul-Allah (Messenger of AIIah), at
	some he uses the word &quot;Messiah&quot; for him, at some

	give the same meaning as: La-ilaha-ll-Allah, Muhammad

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Barnabas

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In these
	clear and comprehensive prophecies there are only three things which
	at first sight appear to be doubtful. First, that in these and in
	several other passages of the Gospel of Barnabas the Prophet Jesus
	(peace be upon him) has denied his own self being the Messiah.
	Second, that not only in these but at many other places also in this
	Gospel the Holy Messenger's actual name &quot;Muhammad&quot; has
	been mentioned, whereas this is not the way the Prophets make
	prophecies: they do not mention the actual name of the one coming in
	the future. Third, that in these the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) has been called the Messiah 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	answer to the first objection is that not only in the Gospel of
	Barnabas but in the Gospel according to Luke also it is mentioned
	that the Prophet Jesus had forbidden his disciples to call him the
	Christ (the Messiah). The words in Luke are: &quot;He said unto
	them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of
	God. And he strictly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man
	that thing.&quot; (9: 20-21) Probably the reason was that about the
	Messiah whom the Israelites were awaiting, they thought he would
	subdue the enemies of truth by the sword. Therefore, the Prophet
	Jesus (peace be on him) said that he was not that Messiah but he
	would come after him.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	answer to the second objection is that no doubt in the extant
	Italian translation of Barnabas the Holy Prophet's name has been
	written as &quot;Mohamed&quot;, but no one knows through how many
	different languages has this book reached the Italian. Obviously,
	the original Gospel of Barnabas must be in Syriac, because that was
	the language of Jesus and his companions. If the original book were
	extant, it could be seen what name of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) was written in it. Now what one can assume is that originally
	the Prophet Jesus must have used the word Munhamanna as we have
	explained above by citing Ibn Ishaq's reference to St. John's
	Gospel. Then different translators may have translated it in their
	own languages. Later, probably some translator seeing that the name
	given in the prophecy was exactly synonymous with the word &quot;Mohamed&quot;
	may have written this very sacred name of the Holy Prophet.
	Therefore, the mere appearance of this name only is not enough to
	give rise to the doubt that the entire Gospel of Barnabas has been
	forged by a Muslim. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	answer to the third objection is that the word &quot;Messiah&quot;
	is an Israelite technical term, which has bets used in the Qur'an
	particularly for the Prophet Jesus for the reason that the Jews had
	denied his being the Messiah; otherwise it- is neither a Qur'anic
	term nor has it been used anywhere in the Qur'an in the meaning of
	the Israelite term, Therefore, if the Prophet Jesus used the word
	Messiah for the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), and the Qur'an has
	not used this word for him, it is not right to conclude that the
	Gospel of Barnabas ascribes something to him which the Qur'an
	denies. In fact, it was customary with the Israelites that when
	somebody or something was set aside for a sacred cause, the person
	or thing was anointed with the holy oil on the head and consecrated.
	This anointing with the oil was called mesh in Hebrew, and the one
	thus anointed messiah &quot; Utensils were likewise anointed and set
	aside for use in the house of worship. The priests also were
	anointed when they were appointed to priesthood. The kings and the
	prophets too were anointed when they were designated to kingship or
	prophethood by God. Thus, according to the Bible, there have been
	many messiahs in the history of the Israelites. The Prophet Aaron
	was a messiah as a priest, Moses as a priest and a prophet, Saul as
	a king, David as a king and a prophet, Melchizedek as a king and a
	priest, and AI-Yas'a (Elisha) was a messiah as a prophet. Later, it
	was no longer regarded as necessary to appoint a person by their
	beliefs and morals and civilization on any philosophy and doctrine
	they please, As against the ways of such people, it is being said
	that the Messenger of Allah has not been sent to make a compromise
	with than, but' with the object that he .should cause the Guidance
	and Religion of Truth which he has brought from Allah to prevail
	over all religion, i.e. every aspect of the way of life. This
	mission he has to accomplish in any case whether the disbelievers
	and polytheists like it or not, and whoever they support it or
	resist it. This declaration has been made in the Qur'an at two other
	places about, in Surah At Taubah: 33 and Surah Al-Fath: 28. Here it
	has been re-iterated for the third time. (For further explanation,

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In fact,
	these people have not been called helpers of Allah for the reason

	in which Allah Himself has granted man freedom of belief and
	disbelief, obedience and disobedience, He does not will to make the
	people His believers and obedient servants by means of His power and
	might. Instead, He adopts the method of admonition and instruction
	to show them the right way through His Prophets and Books. The one
	who accepts this admonition and instruction willingly is a Mu'min,
	the one who submits practically to His Commands, is a Muslim and
	devout God-worshiper, the one who adopts an attitude of
	God-consciousness is a Muttaqi, the one who vies with others for
	good works is a Muhsin, and over and above this, the one who starts
	working for the reformation of the people by means of the same
	method of admonition and instruction and for establishing the system
	of Allah's obedience instead of disbelief and wickedness, is
	declared by Allah as His own helper, as has been mentioned in clear
	words at several places in the verses cited above. If the object
	were to designate such people as helpers of Allah's Religion and not
	of Allah, the words would have been ansar-u din Allah and not
	ansar-Allah, yansuruna din-Allah and not yansurun-Allah, intansuruna
	din-Allah and not in-iansurun-Allah. When in order to convey and
	express a theme; Allah has adopted one and the same style at several
	places, successively, it proves conclusively that the actual object
	is to designate these people as helpers of Allah. But this
	&quot;helpfulness&quot;, God forbid, is not in the sense that these
