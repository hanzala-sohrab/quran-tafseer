<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From
the internal evidence of the subject matter it appears that this
Surah too was revealed in the same stage of the Holy Prophet's life
at Makkah in which the Surah Adh-Dhariyat was revealed. While going
through it one can clearly feel that during the period of its
revelation the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him) was being showered with objections and accusations but there is
no evidence yet to show that severe persecution of the Muslims had
started. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
subject matter of its first section (vv. 1-28) is the Hereafter. As
arguments for its possibility, necessity and occurrence had already
been given in Surah Adh-Dhariyat, these have not been repeated here.
However, swearing an oath by some realities and signs which testify
to the Hereafter, it has been stated most emphatically that it will
surely come to pass, and none has the power to prevent its
occurrence. Then, it has been stated as to what will be the fate of
those who deny it when it actually occurs, and how will those who
believe in it and adopt the way of piety and righteousness
accordingly, be blessed by Allah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
in the second section (vv. 29-49) the Quraish chiefs' attitude
towards the message of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah
he upon him) has been criticized. They called him a sorcerer, a
madman, or a poet, and would thus mislead the common people against
him so that they should not pay any serious attention to the message
he preached. They looked upon him as a calamity that had suddenly
descended on them and would openly wish that he met with a disaster
so that they were rid of him. They accused him of fabricating the
Qur'an by himself and of presenting it in the name of Allah, and this
was, God forbid, a fraud that he was practicing. They would often
taunt him, saying that God could not have appointed an ordinary man
like him to the office of Prophethood. They expressed great disgust
at his invitation and message and would avoid him as if he was asking
them for a reward for it. They would sit and take counsels together
to devise schemes in order to put an end to his mission. And while
they did all this they never realized what creeds of ignorance they
were involved in and how selflessly and sincerely was Muhammad (peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him) exerting himself to deliver them
from their error. While criticizing them for this attitude and
conduct, Allah has put them certain questions, one after the other,
each of which is either an answer to some objection of theirs, or a
criticism of some error. Then, it has been said that it would
absolutely be of no avail to show them a miracle in order to convince
them of his Prophethood, for they were such stubborn people as would
misinterpret anything they were shown only to avoid affirming the
faith. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the beginning of this section as well as in its end, the Holy Prophet
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) has been given the
instruction that he should persistently continue giving his
invitation and preaching his message in spite of the accusations and
objections of his opponents and enemies, and should endure their
resistance patiently till Allah's judgment comes to pass. Besides, he
has been consoled, as if to say &quot;Your Lord has not left you
alone to face your enemies, after raising you as a Prophet, but He is
constantly watching over you. Therefore, endure every hardship
patiently till the Hour of His judgment comes, and seek through
praising and glorifying your Lord the power that is required for
exerting in the cause of Allah under such conditions. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	`Abbas, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, Qatadah, Dahhak, Ibn Zaid and other

	with his Mi'raj (Ascension), against the wall of which he had seen
	the Prophet Abraham reclining. Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Zaid say

	God-worshipers, so is there in every heaven a similar Ka`bah for its
	dwellers which occupies a similar central position for the

	a helpless nation like the children of Israel and the drowning of a
	powerful and mighty ruler like the Pharaoh along with his hosts,
	which was taken in a quiet and listless night on the Mount Tur, is
	proof of the fact how the nature of the Kingdom of the Universe
	demands that man who has been endowed with powers and authority,
	should be subjected to moral accountability and rewarded and
	punished accordingly, and for meeting this demand adequately a Day
	of Reckoning is necessary when the whole of mankind should be
	gathered together and called to account for its deeds. (For further

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The holy

	the world from the Lord of the Universe and the Books they brought
	gave the same one news in every age which the Prophet Muhammad (upon

	and latter generations will one day be resurrected and presented
	before their God and rewarded and punished according to their deeds.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	inhabited House&quot; has been sworn by for the reason that in those
	days the building of the Holy Ka'bah was a great sign, particularly
	for the Arabs, which pointed to the truthfulness of Allah's Prophets
	and to the fact that they were supported by Allah Almighty's
	far-reaching wisdom and great power. 2,500 years before the
	revelation of these verses a person happens to visit these barren
	and uninhabited mountains, without any army or worldly provision,
	leaving behind a wife and a suckling child devoid of material
	support. Then, some time later the same man returns and builds at
	this desolate place a house for the worship of Allah and gives a
	call to the people to come and visit that house as pilgrims. This
	same structure and the call are so fervently received that the House
	becomes the center of the entire population of Arabia. People
	respond to the call enthusiastically and are drawn from every corner
	of the country to the House in a spirit of devotion and dedication.
	For 2,500 years this House continues to remain such a sanctuary of
	peace that while blood is shed in the country around it, none can
	dare raise his hand against another as soon as people enter its
	sacred boundaries; and then because of this very House Arabia is
	blessed with four months of such total peace every year when
	caravans travel in full safety, trade flourishes and markets are
	held. Then the House inspired such awe that during this whole period
	no tyrant could ever look towards it with an evil intention, and
	whoever dared do so was so seized by Allah's wrath that he became an
	object of warning for others. Such a miracle had been witnessed by
	the people themselves only 45 years before the revelation of these
	verses, and many of those who had witnessed it wore still present
	and living in the city at the time when these verses were being
	recited to the people of Makkah. What greater proof could be there
	of the fact that the Prophets of God never uttered empty words? They
	see with their eyes that which others do not see; they talk freely
	of such realities as cannot be comprehended by others by intellect;
	they engage at times in works which might be viewed as madness by
	the contemporary world but which might strike with amazement the
	people coming centuries afterwards. When men of such caliber have
	unanimously been giving in every age the news that Resurrection
	shall occur and accountability shall take place, it would be sheer
	madness to dub it as the bragging of the insane

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	elevated roof (the sky) and the surging ocean have been Sworn by,
	for both these are a pointer to Allah's wisdom and His power, and
	the same wisdom and power prove both the possibility of the
	Hereafter and its occurrence and necessity. As for the sky's being a
	pointer we have already explained it in E. N . 7 of Surah Qaf above.
	As for the ocean, anyone who considers it deeply with an unbiased
	mind will testify that the provision of water in such abundance on
	the earth is by itself such an amazing work which cannot be the
	result of an accident or chance. This also proves that it is not
	possible that such a perfect system could comes into being by chance
	and the bodies of each species could be made precisely according to
	the depth in which it has to live. Its water has been made saline so
	that the bodies of the millions of the animals which die in it daily
	do not rot. Its water has been restrained at a particular level in
	such a way that it neither sinks into the earth's belly passing
	through its cracks and holes, nor it spreads over the land to
	submerge it, but has been checked at the same level for millions of
	years. Because of the existence of this great store of water the
	rainfall is arranged on the dry parts of 'the earth, in which the
	heat of the sun and the circulation of the winds cooperate with full
	regularity. Then the ocean's being inhabited with life and the
	creation in it of the various kinds of creatures has given man the
	advantage that he obtains from it his food and other necessities in
	large quantities. Then its being checked and restrained to a limit
	has given birth to the continents and islands which are the home of
	man, and became of its adhering to and following some fixed laws has
	it become possible that man may navigate his ships in it. Such an
	arrangement could not have possibly existed without the wisdom of an
	All-Wise Being and the power of an Absolute Ruler, nor could this
	deep relationship that binds the interests of man and other
	creatures of the earth to the arrangement of the ocean be
	established at random. Now, if this is undeniable evidence that an
	All-Wise and All-Powerful God has created a vast and surging,
	brackish ocean also besides making countless other arrangements for
	the purpose of settling man on the earth, that person would be
	foolhardy, who expects that the All-Wise God would make arrangements
	for man that he should water his crops from the ocean and provide
	him sustenance thereby but would never question him as to how he
	returned thanks after eating His provisions, and that He would grant
	man the power that he should run his ships on the surface of the
	ocean but would never question him as to whether he had run the
	ships for the sake of the truth, righteousness and justice, or had
	committed robberies. Likewise, it would also be sheer folly to
	imagine that the Absolute Sovereign of Whose power the creation of
	the wonderful ocean is a petty, insignificant sign, Who has checked
	and restrained this vast store of water on this suspended globe
	which is moving in space, Who has dissolved a huge quantity of salt
	in it, Who has created countless varieties of creatures in it, and
	has arranged their sustenance therein, Who carries billions of cons
	of water from it every year by means of the wind and causes it to
	fall regularly as rain on millions of square miles of dry land,
	becomes so helpless and powerless after creating man that He could
	not resurrect him again. &nbsp;

	superior faith and deeds, and this joining will not be of the nature
	of occasional visits and meetings but they will be lodged
	permanently with them in Paradise as is borne out by the words:
	alhaqna bi-him. For the sake of further satisfaction it has been
	stated: &quot;In order to be joined with their offspring the parents
	will not be lowered and reduced in rank, but in order to be joined
	with their elders the rank of the children will be enhanced and
	exalted&quot;.

	should be borne in mind that this news has been given in respect of
	the children who on reaching maturity voluntarily decided to affirm
	faith and of their own free will followed in the footsteps of their
	righteous forefathers. As for those of the children of a believer,
	who might have died even before reaching maturity, there cannot be
	any question of belief or disbelief, obedience or disobedience, for
	they will be admitted to Paradise automatically and will be lodged

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote16sym" HREF="#sdfootnote16anc">16</A>Here,
	the metaphor of rahn (pledge) is very meaningful. If a person takes
	a loan from somebody, and the creditor keeps some article belonging
	to the debtor as a pledge with himself as a guarantee for the
	payment of his right, the debtor cannot redeem his pledge unless he
	pays off the debts; and if he does not redeem his pledge within the
	fixed time limit, the pledged article stands forfeited. The nature
	of the affair between man and God has been compared here to this
	very situation. The provisions, powers, capabilities and authority
	that God has granted man in the world are a debt that the Master has
	given to His servant, and as a guarantee for this debt the self of
	man is a pledge with Allah. If man by employing the provisions and
	the powers and authority in the right way earns the good by which
	the debt can be paid off, he will redeem the pledged thing, i.e. his
	own self, otherwise it will be forfeited. This thing has been said
	immediately after the preceding verse because even though the
	righteous believers may themselves be the people of a very high
	rank, their children cannot redeem their pledge unless they redeem
	their self by their own labor and effort. The earning of the
	forefathers cannot redeem the children. However, if the children are
	able to redeem themselves by virtue of their faith in some degree by
	following their righteous forefathers in their footsteps, it would
	then be Allah's grace and bounty that in Paradise He may exalt them
	from lower ranks to be joined with their parents in the higher
	ranks. The good done by the forefathers can benefit the children
	only so far, but if by their own deeds they deserve Hell, it is not
	possible that they may be admitted to Paradise for the sake of the
	forefathers. Another thing that can be deduced from this verse is
	that the less righteous children's being joined with their more
	righteous forefathers is not in reality the result of the lifework
	of the children but of their forefathers'. They by virtue of their
	deeds will deserve the grace that their children be joined with them
	in order to be a comfort of the eyes for them. That is why Allah
	will not lower their ranks to join them with their children but will
	exalt the children's ranks to be joined with them, so that the
	perfection of Allah's blessings on them is not marred by the
	distress that they may suffer on account of the remoteness of their
	children far away.&nbsp;

	it has been said: &quot;They will be served with the flesh of

	resisting the message of the Ho]y Prophet (upon whom be peace): This
	verse though apparently addressed to the Holy Prophet is actually
	meant for the disbelievers through him. Whenever he spoke of
	Resurrection and the gathering together of mankind, and
	accountability, and meting out of rewards and punishments, and
	Heaven and Hell and recited the verses of the Qur'anin support
	thereof, with the claim that he received that information from Allah

	him seriously themselves nor wanted that the other people should pay
	&quot; any attention to him. Therefore, they would sometimes taunt
	him saying that he was a sorcerer, or that he was a poet, or that he
	was a madman, or that he fabricated those strange things himself and
	presented them as Revelations from Allah only in order to impress
	the people. They thought that by passing such remarks against him
	they would be able to create suspicions among the people about him
	and would thus render his preaching ineffective and vain. About this
	it is being said: &quot;O Prophet, the truth in fact is the same
	that has been presented from the beginning of the Surah to this
	point. If these people call you a sorcerer and a madman on account
	of these things, you should not take it to heart but should go on

	reality, for by the grace of God you are neither.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The word
	kahin (sorcerer) in Arabic is used for an astrologer, fortune teller
	and a wise man. In the pre-Islamic days of ignorance it was a
	full-fledged profession. The sorcerers claimed, and the credulous
	people thought and believed, that they knew the destinies of the
	people, or they had a special link with the spirits, devils and jinn
	through whom they came to know of the unseen realities. If a thing
	was lost, they could tell where it lay; if a theft occurred
	somewhere, they could tell who the thief was; and they could
	foretell destinies. People came to there, and they would tell them
	unseen things in exchange for gifts and offerings. They would
	sometimes visit the towns and villages and would cry about their
	profession so that the people might approach them. They had a way
	and manner and appearance of their own by which they became easily
	recognizable. The language they used also differed from the common
	speech of the people. They would utter rhymed and rhythmical
	sentences with a peculiar accent and modulation and generally used
	vague and ambiguous sentences from which every person could draw his
	own meaning. The Quraish chiefs in order to deceive the common
	people accused the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) of sorcery only
	for the reason that he was giving the news of the realities that arc
	hidden and his claim was that an angel from God came to reveal that
	news to him, and the Word of God that he was presenting was also
	rhymed. But no one in Arabia could be deceived by this accusation
	because no one was unaware of the sorcerers' profession and their
	general way and appearance and their language and business. Everyone
	knew what they did, why the people visited them, what they told
	them, what sort of modulated sentences they uttered and what
	subject-matter they contained. Then, above all, it could not be that
	a sorcerer would rise with a creed that went against the prevalent
	beliefs of the nation and would exert himself preaching it
	continuously at his own risk. Therefore, this accusation of sorcery
	did not apply to the Holy Prophet (on whom be peace) at all and no
	one in Arabia who had any common sense could be deceived by it.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Likewise,
	the disbelievers of Makkah also accused him of madness only for
	their own satisfaction, just as some shameless Western scholars of
	the present day in order to satisfy their malice and enmity against
	Islam, claim that, God forbid, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	had epileptic fits and whatever he uttered during those fits was
	taken as Divine Revelation by the people. No sensible person in
	those days regarded such absurd accusations as worthy of any
	attention, nor can anyone today who reads the Qur'an and studies the
	wonderful feats of the Holy Prophet's leadership and guidance

	these two sentences, the opponents' entire propaganda has been
	nailed, and they have been completely exposed. The reasoning briefly
	is this: These Qaraish chiefs and elders pose as very wise people,
	but does their intellect tell them that they should call a person a
	poet when he is not a poet, and call him a madman when he is
	well-known for his wisdom among the people, and dub him a sorcerer
	when he has not the remotest association with sorcery ? Then, if you
	are passing these judgments only on the basis of intellect and
	reason, you should have passed one judgment, and not so many
	contradictory judgments simultaneously. After all, how can one and
	the same man be a poet and a madman and a sorcerer at one and the
	same time ? If he is mad, he can then neither be a sorcerer nor a
	poet. If he is a sorcerer, he cannot be a poet, and if he is a poet,
	he cannot be a sorcerer, for the language and diction and themes of
	poetry are quite different from the language and themes of sorcery.
	The one who knows the distinctions between poetry and sorcery cannot
	possibly call and regard the same discourse both as poetry and as
	sorcery at one and the same time. Therefore, it is evident that
	these contradictory things are being said against the Prophet
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) not on the basis of intellect
	and reason but only due to obduracy and stubbornness, and the big
	chiefs of the nation blinded by their prejudice and enmity are
	leveling absurd charges which no serious person can regard as worthy
	of any attention. (For further explanation, see E.N. 104 of Al

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some

	a book like the Qur'an, in the style of the Qur'an; whereas it dces

	Our'an is a miracle. The following are in brief some of the main
	characteristics because of which the Qur'an has been a miracle
	before as it is a miracle today: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	Qur'an is the highest and most perfect model of the literature of
	the language in which it was revealed. No word and no sentence in
	the entire Book is sub-standard. Whatever theme has been presented
	in it, has been presented in the most appropriate words and in the
	most suitable style. One and the same theme has been presented over
	and over again but every time in a new style avoiding the defect of
	repetition everywhere. The entire Book, from the beginning to the
	end, is set in the choicest words, like chiseled and polished gems,
	that cannot be replaced. The discourses are so impressive that no
	one who knows the language, even if he is a disbeliever, can help
	being moved to ecstasies on hearing them. Even after 1,400 years
	this Book is still the model of Arabic literature and no other
	Arabic book can approach it in literary excellence not to speak of
	equaling it, Not only this: this Book has so controlled the Arabic
	language that even after the passage of 14 centuries the standard of
	this language's beauty and eloquence is the same that had been set
	by it; whereas in such long periods languages change out of
	recognition. No other language of the world has remained in the same
	state in so far as its spelling and diction, idiom, rules of
	language and usages are concerned. But it is only the power of the
	Qur'an that has held the Arabic language in place each idiom of it
	is still in use in Arabic literature; its literature is still the
	standard literature of Arabic; and in writing and speech still the
	same language is regarded as good Arabic that had been used in the
	Qur'an 1,400 years ago. Is there any man-made book in any language
	of the world that bears the same characteristics? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) This
	is the one single Book in the world, which has so extensively and so
	universally influenced mankind's thoughts, morals, civilization and
	way of life as has no precedent in history. In the first instance,
	its impact changed one nation; then that nation rose and changed a
	major part of the world. No other Book has proved to be so
	revolutionary. This Book has not remained confined to writing on
	paper but in-the practical world its each word has formed and molded
	ideas and thoughts and built up a lasting civilization. Its
	influence has continued being operative for 1,400 years and its
	circle of influence and impact is still expanding every day. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	theme that this Book discusses is the most extensive theme which
	comprehends the whole Universe, from eternity to eternity. It deals
	with the reality of the Universe, its beginning and end, its system
	and law. It tells as to who is the Creator and Controller and
	Disposer of this Universe, what are His attributes, what are His
	powers, and what is that essence and basis on which He has
	established this entire system of the world. It specifies man's
	position and his place which he cannot change. It tells what is the
	right and correct way of thought and action for man in view of this
	place and position, which corresponds to the reality, and what are
	the wrong ways which clash with the reality. Then to prove why the
	right way is right and the wrong ways wrong, it presents countless
	arguments from various phenomena of the earth and heavens, from
	different aspects of the system of the Universe, from man's own self
	and existence and from man's own history. Besides, it also tells how
	and for what reasons man adopts the wrong ways, by what means he can
	find out the right Way, which has always been one and shall remain
	one, and how he has been guided to it in every age. It does not
	merely point to the Right Way but presents a plan of the complete
	system of life for following that way, which contains a detailed and
	systematic code concerning beliefs, morals, purification of self,
	worship, social life, civilization, economy, politics, justice, law
	and every other aspect of human life. Furthermore, it also tells in
	full detail what are the results of following this Right Way and of
	adopting the wrong ways in this world and what consequences of this
	will appear in the Next World after the present system of the world
	has come to an end. It depicts fully the coming to an end of the
	present world and of the establishment of the New World; it gives
	every detail of the process of change; it portrays the Next World
	and describes fully how man will find a totally new life there, how
	his deeds from worldly life will be subjected to accountability,
	what things he will be questioned about, how his complete record,
	which lie will not be able to deny or dispute, will be placed before
	him, what strong evidence will be produced in proof thereof, why the
	culprits will be punished and the righteous rewarded, what rewards
	will be bestowed on the righteous and in what forms will the
	culprits suffer the evil consequences of their misdeeds. The way
	this vast theme has been dealt with in this Book is not of the
	nature of some conclusions that its Author might have reached from
	some syllogistic premises but its nature is that its Author has the
	direct knowledge of the Reality. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">He sees
	everything happening from eternity to eternity. All the realities
	are manifest for Him and the entire Universe is like an open book
	before Him. He sees the entire life of mankind, from its origin to
	its end, even beyond the present life into the second life
	simultaneously, and He is guiding man not on the basis of conjecture
	and speculation but on the basis of knowledge. Not a single truth
	that He presents as knowledge has been proved to be wrong so far.
	The concept of the Universe and Man that He presents fully explains
	all the phenomena and events and can become the basis of research in
	every branch of knowledge. His Word contains the answers to all the
	ultimate problems of philosophy and natural and social sciences, and
	they are so coherent and consistent logically that a perfect,
	consistent and comprehensive system of thought can be built on their
	basis. Then from the practical aspect the guidance that He has given
	to man about various spheres of life is not only highly rational and
	pure but countless men have been living according to it in actual
	fact in different parts of the earth for 1,400 years and have found
	it by experience to be the only valid way. Is there any man made
	book of this unique quality present in the world, or has ever been,
	which may be produced to match this Book ?

	Book was not composed and written all at once and presented before
	the world, but a reformatory movement was started with some basic
	and initial instructions and then for 23 years as the movement
	passed through different stages of its development its parts were
	presented by the tongue of the leader, sometimes as lengthy
	discourses and sometimes as brief sentences, as the conditions and
	requirements of the occasion demanded. Then, when the Mission was
	brought to completion, these parts that had been issued at different
	times were compiled in the form of a complete Book which has been
	known by the name of the &quot;Qur'an&quot; . The leader of the
	movement states that these discourses and sentences are not his
	original work but were sent down to him by the Lob of all Creation.
	If a person asserts that they arc the original work of the leader
	himself, he should produce a precedent from history to prove his
	contention. He should show whether it is possible that the speeches
	made and the instructions given by a man at different times while
	leading a powerful collective movement for years continuously by
	himself in different capacities, sometimes as a preacher and teacher
	of morals, sometimes as a leader of an oppressed class, sometimes as
	the ruler of a state, sometimes as the commander of a fighting army,
	sometimes as a victor. sometime as a law-giver and legislator, could
	form a complete and consistent and comprehensive system of thought
	and action, which should be free from every contradiction and
	inconsistency, which should appear to be dominated by the same
	central idea and pattern of thought, which should show that the
	leader has been building up a universal system of belief and action
	on the basis of the same foundation of his message with which he had
	started his work, and which should be a system each clement and part
	of which is in perfect harmony and consistency with the other parts,
	Then the one who reads this collection of the discourses with a
	discerning eye cannot help realizing that the founder of the
	movement at the outset had a full plan of the movement in view till
	the last stage, and it never happened that a new idea might have
	struck him at some later stage, which was unknown to him before, or
	which he had to change later. If ever there has been a man of this
	caliber, his name should be made known to the world. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) The
	leader who had been made to give these discourses and speak these
	sentences did not suddenly emerge from a hidden place to present
	these before the people nor would disappear after he had done so. He
	had lived his life in full view of society before he started his
	movement as well as continued to live in the same society after that
	till his last breath. The people were well aware of the language and
	style of his conversation and speech. Hadith still presents a major
	part of it and by going through it the people who know Arabic can
	easily find out even today what was the leader's own style of speech
	and conversation. His contemporaries who spoke his language felt
	then and those who know Arabic feel today that the language and the
	style of this Book is very different from the language and style of
	that leader. So much so that whenever in the midst of a sermon
	delivered by the leader there occurs a sentence or two of this Book,
	the distinction between the two becomes all too obvious. The
	question is: Has a man in the world ever had the power, or can he
	have the capability, that he should go on conversing in two
	absolutely different styles consistently for years at a stretch and
	it should never become known that the two separate styles arc, in
	fact, of one and the same person? It is possible that one may
	succeed in such affectation temporarily but it is not &quot; at all
	possible that for twenty-three years continuously a person should
	have a different diction and style when he recites the Revelations
	from Allah and a wholly different diction and style when he speaks
	in his personal capacity. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) The
	leader while leading and guiding the movement met with different
	sorts of conditions. Sometimes he became the target of ridicule,
	humiliation and severe persecution of his fellow-countrymen and the
	people of his own tribe and clan; sometimes his companions were so
	harshly treated that they were compelled to emigrate from the
	country; sometimes the enemies plotted against his life; sometimes
	he himself had to leave his home and city; sometimes he had to pass
	through extreme poverty and starvation; sometimes he had to fight
	wars successively in which he suffered defeats as well as won
	victories; sometimes he overcame the enemies and the same enemies
	who had persecuted him, came before him humbled: sometimes he
	achieved such power which few people in the world have been able to
	achieve. Under all such conditions a person's feelings obviously
	cannot remain the same. When on these different occasions the leader
	spoke in his personal capacity, his words, and speeches carried the
	clear impression of his personal feelings. which naturally arise in
	the heart of a man on such occasions. But the discourses that were
	heard from him as Allah's Revelations in these different conditions,
	are wholly devoid of human feelings. At no place can even an acute
	observer and critic point out the play of human feelings in them.
	The vast and comprehensive knowledge that is contained in this Book,
	is not possessed even by any of the distinguished learned people of
	this 20th century, not to speak of the people of Arabia and Rome and
	Greece and Iran of those days. The condition today is that after a
	man has spent his whole life-time studying a branch of philosophy or
	a natural or social science, he comes to know what ultimate problems
	of his field of study are, but when he studies the Qur'an seriously
	he comes to know that this Book contains a clear answer to those
	problems. This thing is not confined to any one branch of knowledge
	but holds good in respect of all those sciences which have anything
	to do with the Universe and Man. How can one believe that 1,400.
	years ago an un-lettered man in the Arabian desert possessed such
	deep insight into every branch of knowledge, and he had thought over
	every basic problem and thought out an absolute and final answer to
	it?

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Although
	there are several other aspects also of the Qur'an's being a
	miracle, if a man ponders over these few aspects only he will
	realize that the Qur'an's being a miracle is far more evident today
	than it was at the time when it was revealed and if Allah so wills,
	it will go on becoming more and more evident and manifest as time
	passes till the Day of Resurrection.

	questions asked before this were meant to make the disbelievers of
	Makkah realize that whatever they were saying to belie the Prophet
	Muhammad's claim to prophet hood was highly irrational. Now in this
	verse the question put before them is: &quot;What is that in the
	message of the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) which
	you find so embarrassing for yourselves? He just says that Allah is
	your Creator and you should only serve Him. Why are you annoyed at
	it? Are you your own creators? Or, has this vast Universe been
	created by you? If neither of these is true, and you admit that your
	Creator as well as the Creator of the Universe is Allah alone, why
	do you then feel angry with the person who tells you that Allah
	alone is worthy of your service and worship? What you should
	actually feel angry about is that you worship him who is not your
	Creator instead of Him Who is your real Creator. You admit with the
	tongue that Allah alone is your Creator as well as of the whole
	Universe, but if you really had faith in this, you would not have so
	maligned the person who was calling you to Allah's service 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This was
	such a pungent and stinging question that it shook the polytheistic
	faith to the root. Bukhari and Muslim have related that after the
	Battle of Badr, Jubair bin Mut`im came to Madinah to negotiate
	release of the Quraish prisoners of war on behalf of the people of
	Makkah. The Holy Prophet at that time was leading the Maghrib
	Prayer, and he recited this Surah at-Tur in it. Mut`im himself has
	stated that when the Holy Prophet reached this place, his heart
	seemed to be leaving his breast. One main reason of his embracing
	Islam afterwards was that Islam had taken root in his heart on
	hearing these very verses on that day.

	in any case had to be appointed a Messenger in order to deliver the

	question is: Who should decide whom Allah should appoint His
	Messenger and whom He should not? If these people refuse to accept

	not One, but all those whom you have set up as deities also possess
	godly attributes and powers ? Have you really seen the angels and
	found that they are girls, and, God forbid, are begotten of God? Do
	you really know that the Revelation has neither come to Muhammad

	&quot;Whenever you rise from a meeting, you should rise glorifying
	and praising Allah. &quot; The Holy Prophet himself acted upon this
	as well as instructed the Muslims that they should glorify and
	praise Allah when they rose from a meeting. Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi,
	Nasa`i and Hakim have related, on the authority of Hadrat Abu
	Hurairah, that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;If a person sat in a
	meeting in which much controversy took place, and he pronounced the
	following words before rising, Allah would forgive whatever passed
	in the meeting: subhanaka Allahumma wa bi-hamdika, ashhadu-al
	la-ilaha illa Anta, astaghfiruka wa utubu ilaika: ''O Allah, I
	glorify You with Your praises: I bear witness that there is no deity
	but You: I seek Your forgiveness and offer repentance before You. &quot;
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second meaning is: &quot;When you get up from bed, glorify your Lord
	with His praise. &quot; The Holy Prophet acted upon this himself and
	had also taught his Companions that they should pronounce the
	following words when they got up after sleep: l a ilaha ill-Allah
	wahda-hu la sharika lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul-hamdu wa haws ala
	kulli shai In Qadir. Subhan-Allah-i wal-hamdu-lillahi wa la ilaha

	(Musnad Ahmad, Bukhari, on the authority of `Ubadah bin as-Samit). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Its third
	meaning is: &quot;When you stand up for the Prayer, begin it with
	the praise and glorification of Allah. &quot; Accordingly, the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace) taught that the Prayer should be begun,
	after the first takbir, with the following words: Subhanak-Allahumma
	wa bi-hamdi-ka wa tabarak asmuka wa ta'aIa jadduka wa la ilaha
	ghairuka: &quot;Glory be to You, O Allah, and I praise You. Blessed
	is Your name, and You are exalted. There is no god other than You.&quot;
