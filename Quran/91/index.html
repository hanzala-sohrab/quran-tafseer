the second part citing the historical precedent of the people of
Thamud the significance of Prophethood has been brought out. A
Messenger is raised in the world, because the inspirational knowledge
of good and evil that Allah has placed in human nature, is by itself
not enough for the guidance of man, but on account of his failure to
understand it fully man has been proposing wrong criteria and
theories of good and evil and thus going astray. That is why Allah
sent down clear and definite Revelation to the Prophets (peace be
upon them) to augment man's natural inspiration so that they may
expound to the people as to what is good and what is evil. Likewise,
the Prophet Salih (peace be upon him) was sent to the people of
Thamud, but the people overwhelmed by the evil of their self, had
become so rebellious that they rejected him. And when he presented
before them the miracle of the she camel, as demanded by themselves,
the most wretched one of them, in spite of his warning, hamstrung it,
in accordance with the will and desire of the people. Consequently,
the entire tribe was overtaken by a disaster. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

narrating this story of the Thamud nowhere in the Surah has it been
said &quot;O people of Quraish, if you rejected your Prophet,
Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings), as the Thamud
had rejected theirs, you too would meet with the same fate as they
met.&quot; The conditions at that time in Makkah were similar to
those that had been created by the wicked among the people of Thamud
against the Prophet Salih (peace be upon him). Therefore, the
narration of this story in those conditions was by itself enough to
suggest to the people of Makkah how precisely this historical
precedent applied to them. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	the time between sunrise and meridian when the sun has risen high,
	at that height it does not only give light but heat too. Therefore,
	when the word duha is attributed to the sun, its full meaning can be

	infinitive, and interpreted these verses to mean &quot;By the heaven
	and its being established, by the earth and its being spread out,
	and by the human self and its being balanced. &quot; But this
	meaning is not correct for the reason that the following sentence:
	&quot;then inspired it with its wickedness and its piety&quot;, does
	not fit in with the context. Other commentators have taken ma here
	in the meaning of mun or alladhi and they interpret the sentence to
	mean: &quot;Who established the heaven, who spread out the earth,
	and who balanced the human self. &quot; This second meaning is
	correct in our view, and no one can object that ma in Arabic is used
	of lifeless things and irrational creatures, For in the Qur'an
	itself there are numerous instances that ma has been used in the
	meaning of mun, e.g. we la antum `abiduna ma a `bud (&quot;nor are
	you the worshipers of Him Whom I worship&quot;), fankihu ma taba

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>&quot;Balanced
	it&quot; : gave man such a body which by virtue of its erect
	stature, its hands and feet, and its brain was most appropriate for
	him to live as man in the world. He blessed him with the senses of
	sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell which on account of their
	combination and their characteristics could become the best means of
	obtaining knowledge for him. He endowed him with the faculties of
	thinking and reasoning, imagination, memory, discrimination,
	judgment, will-power and such other mental powers by virtue of which
	he is able to perform the functions fit for man in the world. In
	addition, balancing also means that man was not created a sinner by
	birth and a criminal by instinct but on right and sound nature, anti
	was not characterized with any inborn crookedness because of which
	he may be unable to adopt the right path even if he wanted to do so.
	This same thing has been expressed in Surah Ar-Rum, saying: &quot;Be
	steadfast on the nature whereupon Allah has created mankind.&quot;
	(v. 30), and the same has been explained by the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be peace ) in a Hadith, saying: &quot;Every new-born child is
	born on true human nature; it is his parents who make him a&quot;Jew
	or a Christian or a Magian afterwards. Its example is of an animal
	giving birth to complete and sound young one. Do you find any one
	with a torn or slit ear ?&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim). That is, it is
	the polytheistic people who on account of their superstitions of
	ignorance tear and slit the ears of animals after wards; otherwise
	God does not cause an animal to be born with torn ears from its
	mother's belly. In another Hadith the Holy Prophet said: &quot;My
	Lord says: I had created all My servants on true Faith (i.e. on
	sound nature); then the satans came and led them astray from their
	Faith (i.e.. the true natural Faith) and made unlawful what I had
	made lawful for them, and commanded them to associate with Me those
	for whom I had sent down no authority.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad; Muslim
	also has related a saying from the Holy Prophet in similar words).</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote5">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>The
	word ilham is derived from Jahm which means to swallow. According to
	this very basic meaning, the word ilham is used terminologically for
	Allah's inspiring a man with a concept or idea unconsciously.
	Inspiring the human self with its wickedness and its piety and
	virtue has two meanings: (1) That the Creator has placed in it
	tendencies to both good and evil, and this is the thing that every
	man feels in himself. (2) That Allah has endowed every man's
	unconscious mind with the concept that there is a moral good and
	there is a moral evil, that good morals and acts and evil morals and
	acts are not equal and alike; fujur (immorality) is an evil thing
	and taqva (abstention from evils) a good thing. These concepts are
	pot new to man; he is conscious of these by nature, and the Creator
	has endowed him with the ability to distinguish between good and
	evil naturally. This same thing has been said in Surah AI-Balad:
	&quot;And We showed him both the highways of good and evil.&quot; v.
	10); and in Surah Ad Dahr, thus: &quot;We showed him the way,
	whether to be grateful or disbelieving&quot; (v. 3); and the same
	has been expressed in Surah AI-Qiyamah, saying: &quot;In man there
	is the reproaching self (conscience) which reproaches him when he
	commits evil (v. 2),&quot; and &quot;Man knows his own self best,
	even though he may offer many excuses.&quot; (w. 1415). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, one
	should also understand well that Allah has blessed every creature
	with natural inspiration according to its position and nature, as
	has been pointed out in Surah Ta Ha: &quot;Who has given a
	distinctive form to everything and then guided it aright.&quot; (v.
	50). For example, every species of animals has been given
	inspirational knowledge according to its needs by virtue of which
	the fish learns to swim, the bird to fly, the bee to make the
	beehive and the weaver-bird to build the nest instinctively. Man
	also in view of his different capacities has been granted separate
	kinds of inspirational knowledge. His one capacity is that he is an
	animal being; as such the most significant instance of the
	inspirational knowledge that he has been given is that the human
	child starts sucking the mother's milk soon on birth. which no one
	could teach it, had it, not been taught it instinctively by God.
	Another position of man is that 6e is a rational being. As such God
	has boon blessing him with . inspirational guidance continuously
	since the time of his creation, by virtue of which he has been
	discovering things and making inventions to develop his
	civilization. Anyone who studies the history of these discoveries
	and inventions will realize that there was hardly any which might be
	the result of man's own effort or thought, but mostly it so happened
	that suddenly an idea struck a person and he discovered or invented
	something. Besides these two, another position of man is that he is
	a moral being. In this position too Allah has blessed him by
	inspiration with discrimination between good and evil and of the
	realization of the good to be good and of the evil to be evil. This
	sense of discrimination and realization is a universal truth on
	account of which no human society in the world has even been without
	the concepts of good and evil; there has never been in history, nor
	is there now, a society which may not be having some kind of a
	system of rewarding the good and punishing the evil. this fact being
	prevalent in every age, at every place, and at every stage of
	civilization is a clear proof of its being natural and innate.
	Furthermore, this is also proof that a Wise Creator possessed of
	knowledge has endued man's nature with it, for in the elements of
	which man is made up and the laws which govern the material system
	of the world, no human origin of morals can be traced out.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote6">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote6sym" HREF="#sdfootnote6anc">6</A>This
	is for which an oath has been sworn by the things mentioned in the
	above verses. Let us now consider how those things bear upon it. The
	rule that Allah has followed in the Qur'an is that to bear testimony
	to the truths that He wants to impress on the human mind, he cites
	some of the most conspicuous, common-place things which every man
	sees in his surroundings, or in his own self. Accordingly here,
	pairs of contradictory things have been cited, each unlike the other
	in its effects and results, rather opposite and reverse. The first
	pair is of the sun and the moon. The light of the sun is intensely
	bright and also hot. As against it the moon has no light of its own.
	Even if it is there in the sky when the sun shines, it is without
	light. It shines when the sun hides, and even then its light is
	neither so bright that it may change the night into day nor is there
	any heat in it that it may have the same effect as the sun's light.
	Nevertheless, it has its own effects which are quite different from
	the effects of the sun. Likewise, there is the pair of the day and
	the night. Each is the reverse of the other. The effects and results
	of each are so different from the other that no one can say they are
	alike; so much so that even a most foolish person cannot possibly
	say that the day's being the day or the ,night's being the night
	does not make any difference. Likewise, there is the pair of the sky
	and the earth; the former has been raised high by the Creator and
	the latter spread like a carpet beneath it. Although both are
	serving the same universe, its system and expediencies, yet there is
	a world of difference between their functions and their effects and
	results. After citing these universal evidences, man's own self has
	been considered, and it has been said that after balancing it with
	suitable combination of the limbs, senses and mental powers and
	faculties the Creator has placed in it tendencies, inclinations and
	motives to both good and evil, which are contradictory to each
	other, and made him understand by inspiration the distinction
	between the two: that one is fujur, which is evil, and the other is
	tagva, which is good. Now, if the sun and the moon, the day and the
	night, the earth and the heaven, are not alike but necessarily
	different from each other in their effects and results, how can
	fujur and taqva of the self be alike in spite of being reverse of
	each other? Man himself in this world does not regard and
	acknowledge the good and the evil as equal, no matter what criteria
	of good and evil he might have devised for himself according to his
	self-propounded philosophies. In any case, about whatever he regards
	as good, he holds the opinion that it is appreciable and worthy of
	praise, reward and recompense. On the contrary, about whatever he
	regards as evil, it is his own objective opinion that it is worthy
	of condemnation and punishment. But the real judgment does not lie
	with man; it lies with the Creator, Who has inspired man with his
	fujur and taqva. The fujur is that which is fujur in the sight of
	the Creator and the tagva that which is tagva in His sight, and both
	have separate results in the sight of the Creator. The result of the
	one is that he who purifies his self, should attain to eternal
	success, and the result of the, other is that he who suppresses his
	self, should be a failure. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Tazkiyah
	means to purify, develop and cultivate. In the context it clearly
	moans the one who purifies his self of fujur and develops it to the
	level of tagva and cultivates in it the ,good, will attain to
	eternal success. As against this; the word dassaha has been used,
	the infinitive of which is tadsiyah, which means to suppress,
	conceal, seduce and lead astray. The meaning of this also becomes
	clear from the context; i. e. the one who suppresses the tendency in
	his self towards good instead of developing and cultivating it, who
	seduces it into doing evil, and makes fujur dominate over taqva so
	as to cover it up completely like the dead body which is buried and
	covered with earth, will be a failure. Some commentators have
	interpreted this verse to mean: &quot;Truly successful was he whom
	(whose self) Allah purified .and a failure he whom (whose self)
	Allah suppressed.&quot; But this commentary is, firstly, opposed to
	the style of the Qur'an in view of the language, for if Allah had
	meant to say this, He would have said: &quot;Truly successful was
	the self which Allah purified and a failure the self which Allah
	suppressed;&quot; secondly, this commentary clashes with the other
	statements of the Qur'an on this subject. In Surah Al-A`la, Allah
	says: &quot;Truly successful was he who adopted purity.&quot; (v.
	14). In Surah `Abasa, Allah has addressed His Holy Messenger,
	saying: &quot;And. you would not be responsible if he did not adopt
	purity &quot; In both these verses, adoption of purity has been
	regarded as an act of man. Besides, the truth stated at many places
	in the Qur'an is that man in this world is being put to the test.
	For example, in Surah Ad-Dahr, it is said: &quot;We created man from
	a mixed sperm-drop, to try him, and so We made him capable of
	hearing and seeing.&quot; (v. 2) In Surah AlMulk it is stated: &quot;Who
	created death and life that he may try you to see which of you is
	best in deeds. (v. 2) Now, obviously, if the examiner at the outset
	encourages one candidate and discourages the other, the test would
	he a farce. Therefore, the correct commentary is that which Qatadah,
	`Ikrimah, Mujahid and Sa`id bin Jubair have given, saying that the
	subject zakkaha and dassaha is man and not God. As for the Hadith
	which Ibn Abi Hatim has related on the authority of Juwaybir bin
	Sa`id from Dahhak from Ibn `Abbas, saying that the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) himself interpreted this verse to mean: &quot;Truly
	successful was the self whom the Almighty Allah purified&quot;; this
	saying is not confirmed to be from the Holy Prophet, for its one
	reporter Juwaybir, has been rejected as a narrator of Hadith, and
	Dahhak did not meet Ibn `Abbas. However, the Hadith which Imam
	Ahmad, Muslim, Nasa'i and Ibn Abi Shaibah have related on the
	authority of Hadrat Zaid bin Arqam, is correct which says that the
	Holy Prophet used to pray: &quot;O Allah, grant my self its taqva
	and purify it: You alone are the best to purify it; You alone are
	its Guardian and Master. &quot; In almost similar words, this
	supplication of the Holy Prophet has been related by Tabarani Ibn
	Marduyah and lbn al-Mundhir from Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas and
	Imam Ahmad from Hadrat `A'ishah. It actually means that man can only
	desire and seek tagva and tazkiyah; as for its attainment, it
	depends in any case on Allah's grace and,favour alone. And the same
	also is we of tadsiyah: Allah does not suppress a self forcibly, but
	when a man is resolved on iniquity, Allah deprives him of the grace
	of tagva and tazbyab, 'and leaves him alone to suppress and bury his
	self under nay heap of filth he likes.&nbsp;

	things stated in principle in the above verses, are now being
	explained by as historical precedent or what it is a precedent and
	how it relates to what has been stated above, one should consider
	well in .the. light of the other statements of the Qur'an the two
	basic truths which have been expressed in vv. 7-10.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Firstly,
	in these it has been stated that attar creating the human self on
	balanced and sound nature, Allah inspired it with its fujur and its
	taqwa. The Qur'an along with stating this truth also makes explicit
	that this inspirational knowledge of fujur and tagva is not enough
	for every man that he may by himself obtain detailed guidance from
	it, but for this purpose Allah gave detailed guidance to the
	Prophets through Revelation in which it was explained what is fujur
	and what it applies to, which one should avoid, and what is taqwa
	which one should attain and develop, if man does not accept and
	acknowledge this clear and definite guidance sent down through
	Revelation, he can neither avoid fujur not find the way to taqwa. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	in these verses it has been stated that, the rewards and punishments
	are the necessary results which accrue from adoption of either fujur
	or taqva The result of cleansing the self of fujur and developing it
	,with taqwa is eternal success and the result of suppressing its
	good tendencies and causing it to be overwhelmed with fujur
	is.failure, ruin and destruction. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">To make
	man understand this truth a historical precedent is being cited and
	for this the tribe of Thamud has been taken as an illustration, for
	the various tribes destroyed in antiquity the territory of the
	Thamud was closest to Makkah. In northern Hijaz its historical ruins
	were extant. which the people of Makkah passed by during their trade
	journeys to Syria, and the way this tribe has been frequently
	referred to in the pre-Islamic poetry shows that its destruction was
	a common subject of talk among the Arabs.&nbsp;
