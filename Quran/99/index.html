or not it was revealed, at Makkah or Madinah, is disputed. Ibn Masud,
Ata, Jabir, and Mjahid say that it is a Makki Surah and a statement
of Ibn Abbas also supports this view. On the contrary, Qatadah and
Muqatil say that it is Madani and another statement of Ibn Abbas also
has been cited in support of this view. That it is a Madani Surah is
reasoned from a tradition from Hadrat Abu Said Khudri, which Ibn Abi
Hatim has related from him. He says: &quot;When the verse </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Fa-man

was revealed, I said: &quot;O Messenger of Allah, shall I really see
my deeds? The Holy Messenger replied in the affirmative. I submitted:
And every major sin? He replied yes. I said: And the minor sins too?
He replied yes. Thereupon I exclaimed that I would then be ruined.
The Holy Prophet said: Rejoice, O Abu Sa'id, for each good act will
be equal to ten good acts like it.&quot; The basis of the argument
for this Surah's being Madani is that Hadrat Abu Sa'ld Khudri was an
inhabitant of Madinah and reached maturity after the Battle of Uhud.
Therefore, if this Surah was revealed in his presence, as is apparent
from his statement, it must be a Madani Surah. However, the practice
that the Companions and their immediate successors followed in
respect of the occasion of the revelation of the verses and Surahs,
has already been explained in the Introduction to Surah Ad-Dahr
above. Therefore, a Companion's saying that a verse was sent down on
this or that particular occasion is no proof that it was sent down on
that very occasion. It may well be that after coming of age when
Hadrat Abu Sa'id heard this Surah for the first time from the Holy
Prophet, terrified by its last portion he might have asked the Holy
Prophet the questions which we have cited above, and he might have
narrated the incident saying that when this verse was revealed he put
this and this question to the Holy Prophet. In the absence of this
tradition every reader who reads the Qur'an with understandings will
feel that it is a Makki Surah. More than that: from its theme and
style he would feel that it must have been sent down in the earliest
stage at Makkah when the fundamental principles and beliefs of Islam
were being presented before the people in a concise but highly
effective way. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

theme is the second life after death and presentation in it before
man of the full record of the deeds done by him in the world. In the
first three sentences it has been told briefly how the second life
after death will take place and how confounding it will be for man.
In the next two sentences it has been said that this very earth on
which man has lived and performed all kinds of deeds thoughtlessly,
and about which he never could fancy that this lifeless thing would
at some time in the future bear witness to his deeds, will speak out
on that Day by Allah's command and will state in respect of each
individual person what act he had committed at a particular time and
place. Then, it has been said that men on that Day, rising from their
graves, will come out in their varied groups from all corners of the
earth, to be shown their deeds and works, and their presentation of
the deeds will be so complete and detailed that not an atom's weight
of any good or evil act will be left unnoticed or hidden from his

	means to shake violently over and over again. Thus, zulzilat-il,ardu
	means that the earth will be shaken violently by convulsion after
	convulsion, and since shaking of the earth has been mentioned, it
	automatically gives the meaning that the entire earth will be shaken
	and not a limited territory of it. Then, in order to express the
	great intensity of the earthquake the word zilzalaha has been added,
	which literally means &quot;its being shaken&quot;. It mean: &quot;It
	will be so shaken as a huge sphere like it ought to be shaken, or
	shaken to its utmost intensity.&quot; Some commentators have taken
	it to imply the first earthquake with which the first stage of
	Resurrection will begin, i:e. when all living beings will perish and
	the present order of the world will be upset. But, according to a
	large section of them, ii implies the earthquake with which the
	second stage of Resurrection will begin, i. e. when all the former
	and the latter generations of mankind will rise back to life. This
	second commentary seems to be more correct, for the whole subsequent
	theme supports it.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>This

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) It
	will cast out bodies of the dead in whatever form and state and
	wherever they may be lying in the earth; and the following sentence
	indicates that at that time all the scattered parts of the bodies
	will reassemble and be resurrected once again in the same form and
	shape as they had been in their first life, for if it were not so,
	how will they say: &quot;What has happened to the earth ?&quot; It
	will not only cast out the dead bodies of men but also all traces
	and evidences of the words, deeds and activities of their former
	life lying buried in it; the following sentence points out that the
	earth will narrate all that had happened on its back.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) A
	third meaning also has been given by some Commentators, saying that
	it will cast out the treasures of gold, silver, jewels and every
	kind of wealth lying hidden in the earth's belly and man will see it
	and realize how he thirsted for these things in the world: how he
	committed murders. thefts, robberies and piracies in the land and
	sea, usurped the rights of others, waged wars and devastated vast
	populations. On that Day all that will lie heaped up before him, yet

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>Man
	here may as well imply every man, for after resurrection and coming
	to senses the first impression of every man will be as to what was
	happening around him; afterwards he will realize that it was the
	Resurrection Day. Man may also imply the man who denies the
	Hereafter, for what he regarded as impossible would be happening in
	front of him and causing him confusion and bewilderment. As for the
	believers, they will not be bewildered and' confused, for .
	everything would be taking place according to their belief and
	conviction. To an extent, this second meaning is supported by verse
	52 of Surah Ya Sin, in which it has been said that the deniers of
	the Hereafter at that time will exclaim: &quot;Ah, who has roused us
	from our sleeping-place?&quot; .And the reply given would be: &quot;This
	is the same which the Merciful God had promised; and the Messengers
	sent by God had spoken the truth.&quot; This verse does not
	expressly say that this answer to the disbelievers would actually be
	given by the believers, for there is no indication of it in the
	verse. The probability, however, is that the believers will give
	them this answer.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote4">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>According
	to Hadrat Abu Hurairah, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	recited this verse and asked: &quot;Do you know what annals it will
	relate ?&quot; The people said: &quot;Allah and His Messenger have
	the best knowledge.&quot; Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: &quot;The
	annals are that the earth will testify to the deeds which every man
	and woman has done on its back.&quot; She will say: &quot;He or she
	had done such and such a thing on such and such a day. These will be
	the annals the earth will narrate.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi,
	Nasa'i, Ibn Jarir, 'Abd bin Humaid, Ibn al-Mundhir, Hakim, Ibn
	Marduyah, Baihaqi in Ash-Sbu'ab). According to Hadrat
	Rabi'al-Kharashi, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Beware of the earth,
	for it is your root and basis, and there is nothing which a person
	does on it, and it will not report, whether it is good or bad.&quot;
	(Mu jam at-Tabarani). Hadrat Anas reports that the Holy Prophet
	said: &quot;The earth on the Day of Resurrection will bring out
	every act that would have been done on its back. Then he recited
	these verses.&quot; (Ibn Marduyah, Baihaqi). About Hadrat 'Ali it is
	related that when he distributed the money of the Bait al-Mal
	(public treasury) among the needy ones and thus emptied it, he would
	perform two rakahs of the Prayer in it and say: &quot;You will have
	to bear witness that I filled you with justice and emptied you with
	justice.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It might
	have been difficult for a man of ancient times to understand how the
	earth will speak and narrate the annals and events happening on it
	on the Resurrection Day, but in the present age of scientific
	discoveries and the inventions of cinema, loudspeaker, radio,
	television, tape-recorder, electronic equipment, etc., it is no
	longer difficult to understand how the earth will narrate its
	annals. The impression of whatever man speaks is preserved in the
	air, in the radio waves, on the particles of the walls and floors
	and ceilings of the houses, and on the environments of the road,
	plain or field if he spoke outside the house. If Allah so wills He
	can make these things repeat all these voices precisely in the way
	these were uttered in the first instance by man. Man at that time
	will hear with his ears and know that it was his own voice, and all
	his acquaintances also will testify that whatever they were hearing
	was the person's own voice and his own accent. Then whatever man has
	done anywhere on the earth, and in whatever state, has had its
	impression on everything of the environment and its image inscribed
	on it. Even if he did something in pitch dark, there are such rays
	in the Kingdom of God for which darkness and light make no
	difference; they can preserve his image in any case. All these
	images will pass before man on the Resurrection Day like a motion
	picture, and will show him when and where he had done something
	during his life on the earth.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The fact
	is that although Allah directly knows whatever a man does, yet in
	the Hereafter when He will establish His Court, He will punish every
	culprit only after fulfilling all the demands of justice. Any case
	which is brought before His Court against a criminal will be proved
	with such perfect evidence that no room will be left to doubt his
	being a criminal. The first and foremost evidence against him is the
	record in which the two recording angels are recording his each word
	and deed. (Qaf: 17-18, AI-Infitar: 10-12). This record will be
	handed over to him and he will be asked to read it, for &quot;you
	yourself suffice as reckoner against yourself.&quot; (Bani Isra'il:
	14). Reading it man will be bewildered, for &quot;it has left
	nothing un-recorded of our deeds, small or great.&quot; (Al-Kahf:
	49). Then there is man's own body which he had used in the world. In
	Allah's Court his own tongue will bear witness as to what he had
	been speaking through it in the world, his own hands and feet will
	bear witness as to what deeds he had committed through them (An-Nur:
	24). His eyes and his ears will bear witness as to what he saw and
	heard by their means. Even the skin of his body will bear witness to
	his deeds. Bewildered he will ask his limbs, &quot;Why have you
	borne witness against me?&quot; They will reply: &quot;The same God
	Who has given speech to everything has given us speech.&quot; (Ha
	Mim As-Sajdah: 20-22). On top of these, there will be the witnesses
	which will be presented from the earth and all its environments, in
	which man will hear his own voice by his own ears and see the exact
	pictures of his own deeds by his eyes. Furthermore, the ideas,
	motives and aims hidden in the heart of man and the intentions with
	which he had performed every deed will be brought out and placed
	before him as is stated in Surah Al-`Adiyat below. That is why with
	the production of such absolute, clear and undeniable proofs, man
	will be confounded and he will be left with no chance to say
	anything in self-defense to excuse himself. (Al-Mursalat 35-36)&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	they are shown the rewards of their deeds. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Although
	this second meaning also can be taken of the words li yurau' jaza'a
	a malahum (so as to be shown the rewards of their deeds) but li
	yurau' a malahum (so as to be shown their deeds). Therefore, the
	first meaning only is preferable, especially when at several places
	in the Qur'an it has been stated clearly that the disbeliever and
	the believer, the righteous and the wicked, the obedient and the
	disobedient, all will be given their records (e.g. see Al-Haqqah:
	19, 25; Al-Inshiqaq: 7, 10). Evidently, there is no difference
	between showing somebody his deeds and handing over to him his
	record. Furthermore, when the earth will narrate whatever had
	happened on her, the whole picture of the conflict between the Truth
	and the falsehood that has been raging since the beginning of time
	and will continue to rage till the end, also will appear before the
	people and they will see what part the truth-loving people played in
	it and what vile deeds did the supporters of falsehood commit
	against them. It may well be that the people will hear with their
	own ears all the speeches and dialogues of the callers to right
	guidance and of the publicists of error and evil; the whole record
	of the writings and literature produced by the two sides will be
	placed intact before them, and the people gathered together in the
	Plain of Assembly will see with their own eyes the persecution of
	the lovers of Truth by the worshipers of falsehood and all the
	scenes of the bitter conflict that raged between the two parties.&nbsp;

	simple and straightforward meaning of this statement, and it is
	right and correct, is that not an atom's weight of good or evil done
	by a person, will have been left unrecorded in his conduct book, and
	he will see it in any case. But if seeing is taken to imply seeing
	its reward and punishment, it will be wrong to take it in the
	meaning that in the Hereafter every person will be rewarded for his
	most minor offence, and no one will be left un-rewarded for a good
	and unpunished for an evil done by him. For in the first place, it
	would mean that each evil act will be punished and each good act
	rewarded separately; secondly, it also means that no believer,
	however righteous and virtuous, will remain safe from being punished
	for a most ordinary error, and no disbeliever, however wicked and
	iniquitous, will be left unrewarded for a most ordinary good act,
	Both these meanings are opposed not only to the explanations given
	in the Qur'an and the Hadith, but also to reason. From the point of
	view of reason, it is not understandable that a master would refuse
	to pardon a most loyal and dutiful servant for a most minor error,
	and along with rewarding for each act of service and obedience,
	would also punish him for each and every error. Likewise, this also
	is not understandable from the viewpoint of reason that a person
	brought up and favoured by you should prove disloyal and treacherous
	and ungrateful in spite of your favors, and you, over-looking his
	collective attitude, should punish him for each act of treachery
	separately and reward him for each, even if most insignificant, act
	of service separately. As for the Qur'an and the Hadith, they have
	laid down a detailed law of rewards and punishments for the
	different categories of the people, be they believers, hypocrites,
	disbelievers, righteous believers; erring believers, wicked and
	sinful believers, common disbelievers, or wicked and mischievous
	disbelievers, and these rewards and punishments pervade the entire
	life of man, from there to the Hereafter.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, the Qur'an has stated, in principle, certain things
	explicitly: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that the deeds of the disbelievers, idolaters and hypocrites (i.e.,
	the deeds regarded as virtuous) have been rendered vain; they will
	receive no reward for them in the Hereafter; if at all they deserve
	a reward for them, they will receive it here in the world. For this,
	see Al-A'raf: 147, At-Taubah: 17, 67-69; Hud: 15-16; Ibrahim: 18;
	Al-Kahf: 104-105; An-Nur: 39; Al-Furgan: 23; AlAhzab: 19; Az-Zumar:
	65; Al-Ahqaf: 20. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second,
	that evil will be punished to the extent that evil has been
	committed, but the good deeds will be rewarded much more generously
	than what they will actually deserve. At some places it has been
	explicitly stated that a good act will have a ten-fold reward for
	it, and at others that Allah will increase the reward of the good
	act as much as He will please. For this, see AI-Baqarah: 261,
	AI-An`am: 160, Yunus: 26-27, An-Nur: 38, Al-Qasas: 84, Saba: 37, Al
	Mu'min:40. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Third,
	that if the believers abstained from major sins, their ordinary
	offenses will be forgiven. (An-Nisa': 31, Ash-Shura: 37, An-Najm:
	32). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Fourth,
	that the righteous believer shall have an easy reckoning, his evils
	will be overlooked and he will be rewarded according to his best
	deeds. (Al`Ankabut: 7, Az-Zumar: 35, Al-Ahqaf: 16, Al-Inshiqaq: 8).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Hadith also is very explicit in this regard. In the commentary of
	Sarah Al-Inshiqaq above, we have cited the Ahadith which have been
	reported from the Holy Prophet in connection with the explanation of
	easy reckoning and severe accountability. (See E.N. 6 of
	Al-lnshiqaq). Hadrat Anas says that once Hadrat Abu Bakr Siddiq was
	having his meals with the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). In the
	meantime this verse was revealed. Hadrat Abu Bakr withdrew his hand
	from food and said: &quot;O Messenger of Allah, shall I see the
	result of every little evil that I have happened to commit?&quot;
	The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;O Abu Bakr, whatever unpleasant and
	troublesome things you experience in the world, will compensate for
	the little evils that you happened to commit, and Allah is reserving
	every little good that you do for your Hereafter,&quot; (Ibn Jarir,
	Ibn Abi Hatim, Tabarani in AI-Ausat, Baihaqi in Ash-shu ab. Ibn
	al-Mundhir, Hakim, Ibn Marduyah, `Abd bin Humaid). The Holy
	Messenger of Allah had explained this verse also to Hadrat Abu Ayyub
	Ansari, saying: &quot;Whoever from among you dces good will have his
	reward in the Hereafter, and whoever commits an evil will suffer
	punishment for it in this very world in the form of misery and
	disease. (Ibn Marduyah). Qatadah has related this saying of the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace) on the authority of Hadrat Anas: &quot;Allah
	does not wrong a believer in the world: He provides him sustenance
	in lieu of his good deeds; in the Hereafter He will reward him for
	these. As for the disbeliever, he is recompensed for his good deeds
	in the world itself; then when Resurrection takes place, he, will
	have no good work left to his credit.&quot; (lbn Jarir). Masruq has
	related from Hadrat `A'ishah that she asked the Holy Prophet &quot;In
	the pre-Islamic days of ignorance `Abdullah bin Jud`an treated his
	kindred kindly, fed the poor, received his guests well, earned
	freedom for the captives. Will this be of any use to him in the
	Hereafter ? The Holy Prophet replied: No, he never said omit death:
	Rabbighfir-li khati'ati yaum ad-din. `My Lord, forgive me my errors
	on the Judgement Day. &quot; (lbn Jarir) The Holy Prophet gave
	similar replies also in respect of the other people, who did good
	deeds in the pre-Islamic days, but died as pagans. But there are
	certain other sayings of the Holy Prophet, which show that although
	the good done by a disbeliever cannot save him from the fire of
	Hell, yet in Hell he will not be subjected to the severe punishment
	which will be the lot of the wicked, sinful and villainous
	disbelievers, e.g. according to a Hadith, Hatim Ta'i in view of his
	generosity will be subjected to a light punishment in Hell (Ruh
	al-Ma `ani).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">However,
	this verse warns man of a truth of vital importance which is this:
	Even a most ordinary good has its own weight and its own value, and
	the same is also true of evil: even a most ordinary evil will also
	be considered and taken into account; it will not just be
	overlooked. Therefore, no good act, however small and insignificant,
	should be left, undone, for many such good acts can collect and be
	regarded as a major good not in the reckoning with Allah. Likewise,
	even a most ordinary evil also should not be committed, for a large
	number of such ordinary errors can become serious sins. The same
	thing has been described by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) in
	several Ahadith. According to, a tradition related in Bukhari and
	Muslim, on the authority of Hadrat `Adi bin Hatim, the Holy Prophet
	said: &quot;Save yourselves from the fire of Hell even if it be by
	giving away a bit of a date, or by uttering a good word.&quot; Again
	from Hadrat `Adi, in an authentic tradition, the Holy Prophet's
	saying has been reported: &quot;Do not look upon any good work as
	insignificant, even if it be emptying a bucket into the vessel of
	one asking for water, or receiving a brother. of yours with a
	pleasant face. &quot; According to a tradition reported in Bukhari
	from Hadrat Abu Hurairah, the Holy Prophet, addressing the women,
	said: &quot;O Muslim women, no woman should look upon sending a gift
	to her neighbor as mean, even if it be the hoof of a goat.&quot; A
	tradition has been related in Musnad Ahmad, Nasa'i and Ibn Majah
	from Hadrat 'A'ishah, saying that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;O
	`A'ishah, abstain from the sins which are looked upon as trivial,
	for they too will be inquired about by Allah.&quot; Musnad Ahmad
	contains a tradition from Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas'ud, saying that
	the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Beware of minor sins, for they will
	gather together on man so much so that they will kill him. &quot;
	(For the distinction between the grave and the trivial offenses.,
	see E.N. 53 of An-Nisa' and E.N. 32 of An-Najm).
