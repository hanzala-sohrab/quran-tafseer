	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	disbelievers, who were the chiefs of Makkah, whispered to one
	another to this effect: &quot;Anyhow this man cannot be a Prophet
	because he is a human being like us and eats and drinks and has wife
	and children like us. We see nothing unusual about him that might
	distinguish him from us and make him worthy of the office of
	Prophethood. We, however, admit that there is some magic in his talk
	and personality. That is why any one who listens to him or goes near
	Him is charmed. Therefore, the best thing for you is not to listen
	to him at all, nor go near him, for listening to him or going near
	him will only be involving yourselves intentionally in his snare.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	reason why they accused the Holy Prophet of practicing magic was
	that even his antagonists were &quot;charmed&quot; by his
	personality. when they met him. Muhammad bin Ishaq (d. 152 A.H.)
	says, &quot;Once `Utbah bin Rabi`ah, the father-in-law of Abu
	Sufyan, said to the chiefs that he wanted to see Muhammad and give
	him counsel. They said, `We have full confidence in you; you may go
	and have a talk with him.' Accordingly, he went to the Holy Prophet
	and said, `Dear nephew, you know that you were held in great honor
	here before this and you belong to a noble family. Why have you then
	brought this affliction to your people? You have caused discard
	among them: you consider your people to be fools: you speak ill of
	their religion and deities, and you declare their deceased
	forefathers to be disbelievers. My dear nephew, if your object is to
	become a rich man, we can give you so much wealth that you will
	become the richest man among us: if you are seeking a high rank, we
	will make you our chief, even our king, if you so like. But if you
	are suffering from a mental illness which makes you see illusions,
	we will have you treated by the best physicians.' He went on talking
	in this strain and the Holy Prophet remained silent. When he had a
	long talk, the Holy Prophet said, `Abul Walid, have you had your say
	or do you want to say anything more?' He replied that he had said
	what he had to say. Then the Holy Prophet said, `Now listen to me'.
	And he began to recite Surah Ha Mim Sajdah (Chapter XLI) after
	Bismillah and Utbah listened to him as if he had been charmed. When
	the Holy Prophet came to v. 38, he fell down in prostration. Then
	raising his head, he said, 'O Abul Walid, I have said whatever I had
	to say, and you have heard it. Now I have nothing more to say'.
	After this `Utbah walked back towards the chiefs who perceived him
	to be a changed man, and remarked, `By God ! his face shows that he
	is not the same man that he was when he went from here.' When he
	came to them, they asked, `What has been the result of your
	mission'? He answered, `By God, today I have heard a thing the like
	of which I had never heard before. By Allah! It is not poetry nor
	sorcery nor divination. O people of Quraish, I advise you to leave
	him to himself. From what I have heard from him, I conclude that his
	Message is going to bring about a great revolution here. If the
	Arabs overcome him, you will stand absolved from the charge of
	murdering your own brother, and if he over-powers the Arabs, his
	sovereignty will be your own sovereignty and his honor your own
	honor.' The people answered, `By God! you, too, O Abul Walid, have
	been charmed by him'. To this he replied, `I have expressed my
	opinion. Now it is for you to accept or reject it'.&quot; (Ibn
	Hisham, Vol. I, pp. 313-314). Baihaqi, in his narration of the above
	event, makes this addition: &quot;When the Holy Prophet recited v.
	13: `If they turn away from your Message, say to them, I have warned
	you of the coming of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt that visited
	the `Ad and the Thamud', `Utbah placed his hand on the mouth of the
	Holy Prophet, saying, `For God's sake, have mercy on your own
	people'.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, ibn Ishaq has cited another event. Once a man from the
	clan of Arash came to Makkah with some camels and Abu Jahl bought
	them. When he demanded their price, he put him off by lame excuses.
	At last the man came to the Sanctuary of the Ka`bah and began to
	bewail publicly the dishonesty of Abu Jahl. The Holy Prophet was
	also sitting in a corner of the Sanctuary. The chiefs of the Quraish
	said to the man, &quot;We cannot help you in any way in this matter;
	look, there is a man sitting: go to him and he will get you your
	money.&quot; Accordingly the Arashi went towards the Holy Prophet
	and the chiefs began to whisper jokingly, &quot;Today there will be
	great fun!&quot; When the man expressed his complaint before the
	Holy Prophet, he at once stood up and accompanied him to the house
	of Abu Jahl, followed by an informer of the chiefs. The Holy Prophet
	knocked at Abu Jahl's door, who asked from inside, &quot;Who is
	there&quot;? He answered, &quot;Muhammad&quot;. Hearing this, he at
	once came out and the Holy Prophet said to him, &quot;Pay this man
	his dues.&quot; Accordingly, Abu Jahl went in without uttering a
	word, brought the price of the camels and paid the man. At this the
	informer ran back to the Quraish and told them the whole story and
	said, &quot;By God, today I have seen something which I had never
	seen before. When Abu Jahl came out, Muhammad asked him to pay the
	dues, and he obeyed him as if he were spell bound.&quot; (Ibn
	Hisham, Vol. II, pp. 29-30).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It was
	this &quot;charm&quot; of the personality, character and words of
	the Holy Prophet which these people considered to be the effects of
	&quot;charm&quot; and warned the people not to go near him for fear
	of his &quot;magic.&quot;

</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote7">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote7sym" HREF="#sdfootnote7anc">7</A>The
	background of this verse is this: &quot;When the message of the Holy
	Prophet started gaining adherents, the chiefs of Makkah decided
	among themselves to start a propaganda campaign to counteract it.
	For this purpose they decided that every visitor to Makkah for
	pilgrimage should be approached and his mind so poisoned against the
	Holy Prophet that he dces not even go near and listen to him. Though
	this campaign continued throughout the year, in the pilgrimage
	season specially a large number of men were deputed to go to the
	tents of the pilgrims to warn them to beware of the Holy Prophet.
	Different sorts of things were said against the Holy Prophet during
	these talks. Sometimes it was said that he was a sorcerer, or that
	he had fabricated the Qur'an himself but attributed it to Allah.
	Some would say that his `Revelations' were the words of an insane
	person and a bundle of incoherent ideas. Others would say that these
	were ordinary poetic ideas which were being dubbed as the words of
	Allah. All they wanted to do was to poison the minds of the visitors
	irrespective of the correctness of their own versions. They had no
	considered and definite opinion in the matter.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	false propaganda, however, had just the opposite effect. The name of
	the Holy Prophet became known throughout the length and breadth of
	the country through the nefarious activities of the chiefs of
	Makkah. A positive kind of approach from the Muslims would not have
	achieved the same publicity in years as was achieved so rapidly
	through this negative campaign of the Quraish. It set everybody
	thinking: &quot;After all, who is this man against whom such a
	campaign of vilification has been started?&quot; The serious type
	among them rather came to the conclusion that they must hear the
	Holy Prophet himself and said to themselves: &quot;After all we are
	not children who can be easily enticed away&quot;.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">For
	instance, Ibn Ishaq has related in detail the story of
	Tufail-bin-'Amr Dausi in his own words: &quot;I was a poet of the
	clan of Daus. Once I went to Makkah and was, on my arrival there,
	surrounded by some people of the Quraish who told me all sorts of
	things against the Holy Prophet. So I grew suspicious and tried to
	avoid him as far as possible. The very next day, when I went to
	visit the Sanctuary, I saw him saying his prayer. By chance, I heard
	a few sentences and felt that what he was reciting were excellent
	words. I said to myself, `I am a poet and a sensible young man and
	no child who cannot discriminate between the right and the wrong.
	Why should I not therefore meet him and inquire what he is
	reciting?' Accordingly, 1 followed him to his house and said, `The
	people had so mch poisoned me against you that I had actually put
	cotton into my ears lest I should hear. your voice, but what I have
	heard today from you by chance was so appealing that I feel urged to
	inquire into your Message rather in detail. At this the Holy Prophet
	recited a passage of the Qur'an, as a result of which I embraced
	Islam there and then. On my return home I induced my father and wife
	to become Muslims, which they did, and then invited the people of my
	clan to embrace Islam with the result that till the Battle of the
	Trench as many as eighty families from my clan had entered the fold
	of Islam.&quot; (Ibn Hisham, Vol. II, pp. 22-24).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to another tradition cited by Ibn Ishaq, the chiefs of the Quraish
	confessed in their private meetings that all their charges against
	the Holy Prophet were false. According to him, addressing a meeting,
	Nadr bin Harith once said, &quot;You cannot overcome Muhammad by the
	methods you are adopting against him. When he was a young man you
	regarded him as your best-mannered person and looked upon him as
	your most truthful and honest man. Now that he has attained advanced
	age, you say, He is a sorcerer: he is a sooth-sayer: he is a poet:
	he is insane.' By God, he is not a sorcerer, for we very well know
	what kind of people the sorcerers are and what kind of tricks they
	resort to. By God, he is not a soothsayer, for we are fully aware of
	the guess-works of the sooth-sayers. By God, he is not a poet for we
	know what poetry is and can judge that his words cannot be
	classified under poetry in any sense. By God, he is not insane, for
	we all know what nonsensical things the insane people utter.
	Therefore, O chiefs of the Quraish, let us think of some other plan
	to defeat him&quot;. After this, he himself proposed that stories
	from Persia like dose of Rustam and Asfandyar should be given
	publicity to divert the people's attention from the Qur'an.
	Accordingly, they put this scheme into practice and Nadr himself
	began to relate such stories before the people. (Ibn Hisham, Vol. l,
	pp. 320-321).</P>

	very sentence, &quot;You may ask them, if they can speak&quot;, is a
	clear proof that it was not a lie when Prophet Abraham said, &quot;All
	this has been done by their chief.&quot; What he intended by this
	was to make them realize and confess that their idols were helpless
	because they could do nothing to protect themselves, and could not
	even speak. It is clear that when a person poses an unreal question
	for the sake of argument in order to bring home the fact that the
	position taken by the other party is untenable, it cannot be
	considered as a lie; firstly, because the speaker himself never
	intended it to be a lie, and secondly, because the addressees also
	knew that it was not a lie. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	foregoing remarks have been necessitated because of a &quot;tradition&quot;
	that Prophet Abraham told three &quot;lies&quot; in his life, of
	which one is the above mentioned event. The second &quot;lie&quot;
	is contained in XXXVII: 89: &quot;I am indisposed&quot;, and the
	third &quot;lie&quot; is not contained in the Qur'an but in the
	Bible that he declared his wife to be his sister. (Gen. 12:12,13,
	18;19). It is a pity that this &quot;tradition&quot; has given rise
	to two divergent opinions. The orthodox traditionalists actually
	believe that Prophet Abraham told these lies just because an
	&quot;authentic tradition&quot; says so. They do not consider that
	it is far better to discard the &quot;tradition&quot; according to
	which a Prophet is accused of being a &quot;liar&quot;. On the other
	hand, those who are against the Traditions, discard all of them just
	because this solitary tradition, which has been reported as
	authentic by Bukhari and Muslim, is unreliable on the very face of
	it. Obviously it needs no elaborate arguments to prove that all the
	traditions cannot be discarded just because one or a few of them are
	unreliable. As regards the upholders of the first opinion, they have
	gone to the other extreme and think that a tradition can be
	discarded in spite of the authenticity of its reporters for cogent
	reasons. They do this without reference to the contents of the
	tradition itself. But if the text of the tradition itself clearly
	shows that such a thing could not have been said by the Holy
	Prophet, there is no reason to insist that it should be accepted as
	authentic merely because its reporters are authentic.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This,
	tradition is unreliable for other reasons also. As has already been
	shown, the first &quot;lie&quot; is no lie at all. As regards the
	second &quot;lie&quot;, (&quot;I am indisposed&quot;); it cannot be
	considered as a lie unless it is proved beyond doubt that Prophet
	Abraham was perfectly healthy at that time, and the text does not
	testify this. As regards the third &quot;lie&quot;, the event stated
	in the Bible in chapter 12 of Genesis is absurd on the face of it.
	When Prophet Abraham went to Egypt with his wife Sarah, he was,
	according to the Bible itself, 75 years old and his wife was 65.
	Therefore the very age of Sarah is a clear proof that she could not
	be a &quot;fair woman to look upon&quot; to force Prophet Abraham to
	pose that she was his sister in order to save his life. The
	tradition under discussion, which accuses Prophet Abraham to be
	guilty of telling a lie, has accordingly no basis at all and cannot
	be taken as reliable in spite of its authentic reporters. &nbsp;

	them it is impossible even for Allah to go beyond the routine of the

	thereupon hid his wife and child in a cave where they lived for ten
	years. In the 11th year Abram was taken by Terah to Noah, where he
	lived under the guidance of Noah and his son Shem for 39 years.
	During the same period Abram married his niece Sarai, who was 42
	years his junior. (The Bible does not mention that Sarai was the
	niece of Abram; moreover, the difference in their ages is mentioned
	as ten years). (Gen. 11: 29, 17: 17). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Talmud then says, &quot;Abram left Noah at the age of 50 and came
	back to his father. Here he found that his father was an idolatry
	and had twelve idols in the house according to the twelve months of
	the year. He tried to preach to his father against idolatry but when
	the latter did not listen to him, Abram one day broke all the idols
	in the house. Seeing this Terah went straight to Nimrod and
	complained that the son who was born in his house 50 years ago had
	misbehaved and broken the idols. He wanted the King's verdict on
	this. Nimrod sununoned Abram for interrogation, but the replies
	given by Abram were straight, terse and clear. Nimrod sent him to
	jail and then referred the matter to the Council for a decision. The
	Council decided that Abram should be burnt to death. A fire was
	accordingly prepared and Abram was cast into it. His brother and
	father-in-law Haran was also similarly cast into the fire. Haran was
	punished because Nimrod enquired of Terah as to why he had another
	child killed in place of Abram when he wanted to kill Abram on the
	day of his birth. Terah replied that this was done at the
	instigation of Haran. Nimrod accordingly let off Terah but threw
	Haran into the fire along with Abram. Haran was burnt to death
	instantly but people saw that Abram was walking unhurt through the
	flames. When Nimrod was informed of it, he witnessed it with his own
	eyes and cried out: `O man of the God of Heaven, come out of the
	fire and stand before me'. Thereupon, Abram came out and Nimrod
	became one of his .believers and gave him many costly presents.
	After this, according to the Talmud, Abram stayed in `Iraq for two
	more years when Nimrod saw a dreadful dream and the astrologers told
	him that the destruction of his empire .would come through Abram and
	that he should, therefore, put him to death. Nimrod sent people to
	kill Abram but Abram came to know of the plot before-hand through
	Eleazar, a slave presented to him by Nimrod himself. Abram
	accordingly fled and took refuge with Noah where Terah also met him
	off and on secretly. The father and the son at last decided to leave
	the country and Noah and his son Shem also approved of their plan.
	Accordingly, Terah along with his son Abram and his grandson Lot and
	his grand-daughter and son's wife Sarai, left U: and went to Haran.&quot;

	this: The goats of one person entered into the field of another
	person at night. The latter brought his complaint to Prophet David
	who decided that the strayed goats should be given to the owner of
	the field. Prophet Solomon, however, differed with this and opined
	that the goats should remain with the owner of the field up to the
	time that the former tilled and prepared the field as before. In
	regard to this Allah says, &quot;We led Solomon to the right
	decision&quot;. As regards the legal aspect of the matter we cannot
	say with certainty what is the Islamic law in such a case nor is

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It
	should, however, be noted that in this context, the incident has
	been cited to show that the Prophets were after all human beings in
	spite of their God given powers and abilities. In this case, Prophet
	David committed an error of judgment because he was not guided by
	Allah as was Prophet Solomon, though both of them were Prophets. In
	the succeeding passage the wonderful powers of both have been
	mentioned to show that they were God-given and did not snake anyone
	a god.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Incidentally,
	we learn froth this verse that if two judges give different
	decisions about one and the same case, both of them will be regarded
	as righteous, though the decision of only one of them will be
	correct, provided that both are duly qualified for sitting in
	judgment on the case. The Holy Prophet has stated the same principle
	more elaborately. In a Tradition of Bukhari, he is reported by 'Amar
	bin 'As to have said, &quot;If a judge does his very best to arrive
	at the right decision, he will get a double reward in case of a
	right judgment and a single reward if his judgment is wrong.&quot;
	According to another Tradition, cited by Abu Da'ud and Ibn Majah, on

	are of three kinds and only one of them will go to Paradise: the one
	who recognizes the Truth and decides according to it. On the other
	hand, the one who recognizes the Truth but gives his decision

	the wording of the Text, it is clear that &quot;the mountains and

	&quot;We had subdued the mountains by Our Command so that they
	praised Us with him (David) in the morning and evening, and the
	birds too, which gathered together and repeated Our praise with
	him&quot;. And, according to XXXIV: 10: &quot;We commanded the

	Prophet David sang hymns of Allah's praise and glory, in his rich

<DIV ID="sdfootnote72">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote72sym" HREF="#sdfootnote72anc">72</A>According
	to XXXIV: 10-11, it was like this: &quot;....And We made the iron
	soft for him (and commanded him): `Make coats of mail complete in
	every way, and arrange the plates properly....&quot;'. This shows
	that Allah had made Prophet David an expert in the use of iron, and
	had especially taught him the art of an armorer for defense
	purposes. This fact is confirmed by archaeological and historical
	researches, for according to these the iron-age in the world started
	between 1200 and 1000 BC and this was precisely the period of
	Prophet David. At tirst the Hittites in Syria and Asia Minor, who
	flourished between 2000 and 1200 BC, discovered a method of melting
	and molding iron, but they guarded it as a close secret from the
	world, and it could not be put to common use. Later on, the
	Philistines came to know of it, but they too guarded it as a secret.
	The incessant defeats suffered by the Israelites at the hands of the
	Hittites and the Philistines before King Saul, were due mainly to
	the use of chariots of iron in their wars by the latter. (Joshua,
	17:16; Judges, 1: 19, 4: 2-3). In 1020 BC when Saul became ruler
	over the Israelites by Allah's Command, he subdued the Canaanites
	and recaptured most of Palestine. After him Prophet David (1004-965
	BC) not only annexed the whole of Palestine and Jordan to the
	Israeli kingdom but a major portion of Syria as well. This was the
	time when the secret of armor making closely guarded by the Hittites
	and the Philistines, became well known and cheaper articles of daily
	use began to be made. The recent archaeological excavations
	conducted in Edom, to the south of Palestine, which is rich in iron
	ore, have brought to light furnaces for melting and molding iron.
	The furnace excavated near Ezion-geber, a port on the Gulf of
	`Aqabah, in the time of Prophet Solomon, seems to have been built on
	the principles which are used in the modern blast furnaces. It is
	therefore natural that Prophet David must have first of all utilized
	this discovery for war purposes, because a little earlier the
	hostile Canaanites around his kingdom had made life really difficult
	for his people. The Bible also says that Prophet David was an expert
	in the art of melting and using iron for war purposes. (See Joshua,
	17: 16; Judges, 1:19 and 4: 2-3).</P>

	a favorable wind was always blowing for his ships to and from those
	places.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is

	ships sailed from Ezion-geber, through the Red Sea, towards Yaman
	and other southern and eastern lands, and on the other, his naval
	fleet called Thar-shish, sailed on the Mediterranean to the western
	countries. The great furnace which he had built at Ezion-geber for
	melting and molding ores extracted from the copper and iron mines in
	the `Arabah in Edom, has been confirmed by modem archaeological
	researches as well. This molten iron and copper was used in building
	ships besides being put to other uses. The Qur'an refers to this

	Prophet Solomon's fleet. But if we take the literal meaning of v.

	granted their prayers in supernatural and miraculous ways.

<DIV ID="sdfootnote99">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote99sym" HREF="#sdfootnote99anc">99</A>The
	interpretation of this verse has given rise to a great
	misunderstanding. Some people have tried to interpret it in a way,
	which is entirely opposed to the ideology of the Qur'an. They
	interpret it to mean: &quot;The inheritance of the kingdom and the
	resources of the earth are given to the righteous people alone in
	this worldly life, and upon them alone Allah showers His favours and
	blessings.&quot; Then they apply this formula conversely and
	conclude that the gift of this inheritance of the earth is the sole
	criterion between the &quot;righteous&quot; and the &quot;unrighteous&quot;
	men. The righteous is the one who inherits the sovereignty of the
	earth and the unrighteous the one who is deprived of this
	inheritance. But when they apply their formula in the historical
	perspective, they find that most of those nations which have
	inherited the earth in the past and are inheriting it today, have
	been and are mostly disbelieving, mushriks, atheists and immoral,
	and that these are not the characteristics of the righteous people
	when judged by the criterion put forward by the Qur'an. From Nimrod
	and Pharaoh to the present day communist despots, who have been
	inheriting the earth, were and are unbelievers and the enemies of
	God and therefore could not be considered righteous, according to
	the Quranic formula. Faced with this situation, they start arguing
	that there must be some error in the conception of the &quot;righteous&quot;
	which should be such as would fit all the inheritors of the earth
	whether they were Caliphs like Abu Bakr Siddiq and `Umar Faruq or
	Chingez and Halaku. This research leads them to the Darwinian theory
	of the survival of the fittest and they assume fitness to be a
	synonym of &quot;righteousness&quot;. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to this new conception or definition of &quot;righteousness&quot;,
	the proposition would plainly mean: &quot;Any person, or a group of
	persons, who is capable of conquering and subduing countries by
	military force and has the ability to exploit the resources of the
	earth successfully is a `righteous servant of Allah' and his
	achievement is a criterion and message of righteousness and worship
	for other human beings to follow. Consequently, if they fail to
	achieve the inheritance of the earth, they will neither be regarded
	among the righteous nor among the servants of Allah&quot;. As a
	result of this interpretation of the verse, and this conception of
	&quot;righteousness&quot; and &quot;service&quot;, they were
	confronted with the interpretation of some basic and fundamental
	articles of the Islamic Faith. For instance, according to the
	Qur'an, no deed, howsoever good, could be regarded as righteous
	without belief in Allah, the Hereafter, the Prophets and the Books.
	Moreover, the invitation of the Prophet to accept the moral and
	legal systems of Islam would become meaningless. Then these people
	could not reconcile their interpretation with the teachings of the
	Qur'an that obedience to the Holy Prophet and the Commandments of
	Allah was absolutely essential for a righteous tnan and that the
	lack of this would make a person a disbeliever and a transgressor
	who deserved the wrath of Allah. If they had faced this problem
	boldly and honestly, they would have realized that their
	interpretation was wrong, but instead of this, they very impudently
	changed the universally accepted conception of Faith, Islam, Tauhid,
	Prophethood and the Hereafter in order to make these basic articles
	of the Faith fit in with their interpretation of this verse. Thus,
	they turned all the teachings of the Qur'an upside down and tampered
	with its meaning without the least hesitation. Now let us consider
	their interpretation and point out its errors: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) Their
	interpretation contradicts the teachings of the Qur'an as a whole,
	for according to these virtue, piety and goodness do not comprise
	material progress and ability to rule over the land. Moreover, if
	the Quranic word &quot;Salih&quot; (virtuous, good) is regarded as
	synonymous with &quot;Sahib Salahiyyat&quot; (i.e. possessor of
	fitness and competence), this one verse will clash with the whole of
	the Qur'an. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) They
	isolate this verse from its context and ascribe to it whatever
	meaning they like; otherwise, they would have seen that the
	&quot;inheritance&quot; referred to in the context is the promise to
	the Believers which is to be fulfilled in the Hereafter, and thus
	has nothing to do with inheritance in this world. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If this
	verse is interpreted in the context in which it occurs, it becomes
	very plain from the preceding verses that this promise to the
	righteous people holds good for the life in the Hereafter. This
	thing has been made more explicit in XXXIX: 73-74. According to this
	passage (which is definitely about life in the Hereafter), when the
	pious people will enter into Paradise, they will say: &quot;God be
	praised, Who has fulfilled His promise and made us heirs to the
	land.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider this matter in the light of the Psalms (whether the Book
	of Psalms in the Bible is genuine or tampered with, because the real
	Psalms of Prophet David are nowhere available) to which this verse
	refers. According to 37:9-29: &quot;....evildoers shall be cut off:
	but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth. For
	yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt
	diligently consider his place, and it shall not be. But the meek
	shall inherit the ' earth; and shall delight themselves in the
	abundance of peace....and their inheritance shall be for ever....The
	righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.&quot;
	Thus the Psalms also confirm word for word verse 105. It is obvious
	that &quot;(They shall) dwell therein for ever&quot; refers to the
	life in the Hereafter. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the inheritance of the earth in this worldly life, Allah
	gives it as a heritage to those of His servants whom He pleases
	(VII:128), irrespective of whether they are believers or
	disbelievers, righteous or wicked, not as a reward but for their
	trial. &quot;....Your Lord will make you rulers on the earth, and
	then He will see how you conduct yourselves.&quot; (VII:129). The
	heritage of the earth in this worldly life is neither permanent nor
	everlasting. It is merely bestowed as a trial for different
	communities. On the other hand, the heritage of the &quot;land&quot;
	referred to in v. 105 is permanent and for ever and, according to
	the Qur'an, it will be bestowed on the basis of this formula: &quot;The
	land belongs to Allah and He will make only His righteous servants
	heirs to it not for their test but as a permanent reward for the
	righteous attitude they adopted in this worldly life.&quot;
