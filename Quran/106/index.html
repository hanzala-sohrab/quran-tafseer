closely relates to that of Surah Al-Fil that probably it was revealed
immediately after it, without any other Surah intervening between
them. On the basis of this very relevance, some of the earliest

tribe of Quraish was scattered throughout Hijaz until the time of
Qusayy bin Kilab, the ancestor of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
Allah's peace). First of all, Qusayy gathered it in Makkah and this
tribe was able to gain authority over the Ka'bah. On that very basis
Qusayy was called </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">mujammi</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">(uniter, assembler) by his people.
This man by his sagacity and wisdom founded a city state in Makkah
and made excellent arrangements for the welfare of the pilgrims
coming from all over Arabia, with the result that the Quraish were
able to gain great influence among the Arabian tribes and lands.
After Qusayy the offices of the state of Makkah were divided between
his sons, Abdi Manaf and Abd ad-Dar, but of the two Abdi Manaf gained
greater fame even during his father's lifetime and was held in high
esteem throughout Arabia. Abdi Manaf had four sons: Hashim, Abdi
Shams, Al-Muttalib, and Naufal. Of these Hashim, father of Abdul
Muttalib and grandfather of the Holy Prophet, first conceived the
idea to take part in the trade that passed between the eastern
countries and Syria and Egypt through Arabia, and also to purchase
the necessities of life for the Arabians so that the tribes living by
the trade route bought these from them and the merchants living in
the interior of the country were attracted to the,market of Makkah.
This was the time when the Sasanian kingdom of Iran had captured the
international trade that was carried out between the northern lands
and the eastern countries and Byzantine empire through the Persian
Gulf. This had boosted up the trade activity on the trade route
leading from southern Arabia to Syria and Egypt along the Red Sea
coast. As against the other Arabian caravans, the Quraish had the
advantage that the tribes on the route held them in high esteem on
account off their being keepers of the Ka'bah. They stood indebted to
them for the great generosity with which the Quraish treated them in
the Hajj season. That is why the Quraish felt no fear that their
caravans would be robbed or harmed any where on the way. The tribes
on the way did not even charge them the heavy transit taxes that they
demanded from the other caravans. Hashim taking advantage of this
prepared the trade scheme and made his three brothers partners in it.
Thus, Hashim obtained trade privileges from the Ghassanide king of
Syria, Abdi Shams from the Negus, Al-Muttalib from the Yamanite
nobles and Naufal from the governments of Iraq and Iran, and their
trade began to flourish. That is how the four brothers became famous
as traders and began to be called ashab al-ilaf (generators of love
and affection) on account of their friendly relations with the tribes
and states of the surrounding lands. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Because
of their business relations with Syria, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Yaman and
Abyssinia, the Quraish came across such opportunities and their
direct contact with the culture and civilization of different
countries so enhanced the level of their knowledge and wisdom that no
tribe in Arabia could match and equal them. As regards wealth and
worldly goods they became the most affluent tribe, and Makkah became
the most important commercial center of the Arabian peninsula.
Another great advantage that accrued from these international
relations was that they brought from Iraq tile script which later was
used for writing down the Quran. No other Arabian tribe could boast
of so many literate people as Quraish. For these very reasons the
Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: &quot;Quraish are the leaders
of men.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad: </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Marwiyat
Amr bin al As</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">).
And according to a tradition from Hadrat Ali in Baihaqi, the Holy
Prophet said: &quot;First the leadership of the Arabians was in the
hands of the people of Himyar, then Allah withdrew it from them and
gave it to Quraish&quot;. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Quraish were thus prospering and flourishing when the event of
Abrahah's invasion of Makkah took place. Had Abrahah at that time
succeeded in taking this holy City and destroying the Ka'bah, the
glory and renown of not only the Quraish but of the Ka'bah itself,
would have faded away, the belief of the pre-Islamic Arabia that the
House indeed was Allah's House would have been shattered, and the
high esteem in which Quraish were held for being keepers of the House
throughout the country would have been tarnished. Then, after the
Abyssinian advance to Makkah, the Byzantium also would have taken the
initiative to gain control over the trade route between Syria and
Makkah: and the Quraish would have been reduced to a plight worse
than that in which they were involved before Qusayy bin Kilab. But
when Allah showed this manifestation of His power that the swarms of
birds destroyed 60,000 Abyssinian troops brought by Abrahah by
pelting then, with stones, and from Makkah to Yaman they went on
falling and dying by the wayside, the faith of the Arabs that the
Ka'bah indeed was Allah's House increased manifold, and the glory and
renown of Quraish too was enhanced considerably throughout the
country. Now the Arabs were convinced that they were under Allah's
special favor; therefore, they visited every part of Arabia
fearlessly and passed through every land with their trade caravans
unharmed. No one could dare touch them with an evil intention. Not to
speak of touching them, even if they had a non-Quraishite under their
protection, he too was allowed to pass unharmed. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Ka'bah) to be Allah's House, and not of the idols, and when you fully
well know that it is Allah alone Who has granted you peace by virtue

	word ilaf, as used in the original is from alf which means to be
	habituated and accustomed to be reunited after breaking up, and to
	adopt something as a habit. About the lam that is prefixed to ilaf,
	some Arabists have expressed the opinion that it is to express
	surprise and wonder. Thus, Li-ilaf-i Quraish in means: &quot;How
	surprising is the conduct of Quraish! It is only by virtue of
	Allah's bounty that they are reunited after their dispersion and
	have become accustomed to the trade journeys which have brought them
	their prosperity,. and yet from Allah's worship and service they are

	Farra', and holding this opinion something after this lam, the same
	thing itself is regarded as sufficient to show that the attitude and
	conduct a person has adopted in spite of it, is surprising and
	amazing&quot;. On the contrary, Khalil bin Ahmad, Sibawaih and
	Zamakhshari say that this is the lam of to `lil and it relates to
	the following sentence: Fa! ya `budu Rabba hadh a!-Bait, which
	means: &quot;Allah's blessings on the Quraish are countless. But if
	for no other blessing, they should worship Allah at least for this
	blessing that by His bounty they became accustomed to the trade
	journeys, for this by itself is indeed a great favor of Allah to
