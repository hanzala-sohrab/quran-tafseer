<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
is related that after its revelation, once Hadrat Abu Bakr said to
the Holy Prophet, &quot;Of late I have been noticing that you are
growing older and older. What is the cause of it?&quot; The Holy
Prophet replied, &quot;Surah Hud and the like Surahs have made me
old.&quot; This shows that it was a very hard time for the Holy
Prophet and these stern warnings added greatly to his anxieties that
were caused by the persecution from the Quraish, who were doing their
worst to crush down the Message of Islam. For it was obvious to the
Holy Prophet that the last limit of the respite given by Allah was
approaching nearer and nearer and he was afraid lest the term of the
respite should expire and his people be seized by the torment. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
admonition is this: Remember that those people who put their faith in
the outward appearance of this worldly life and rejected the Message
of the Prophets met with dire consequences. Therefore you should
consider it seriously whether you should follow the same way that
history has proved to be the path to ruin. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

warning is this: You should not be deluded by the delay in the coming
of the punishment: it is because of the respite that Allah has
granted you by His grace so that you might mend your ways: if you do
not make use of this opportunity, you shall be inflicted with an
inevitable punishment that will destroy you all except the Believers.

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Instead
of addressing the people directly, the Quran has used the stories of
the people of Noah, Hud, Salih, Lot, Shu'aib and Moses to achieve the
above mentioned objects. What is most prominent in their stories is
that when Allah passes His judgment on the people, He does not spare
anyone whatsoever, even if he be the nearest relative of the Prophet
of the time. Only that one is rescued who had believed in the
Prophet, and none else, not even his own son or wife. More than that:
the Faith demands from each and every Believer that he should totally
forget his relationships when that judgment comes and remember only
the relationship of the Faith. For it is against the spirit of Islam
to show any regard whatsoever for the relationships of blood and
race. And the Muslims demonstrated these teachings practically in the
Battle of Badr, four years after the revelation of this Surah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

In answer to this, those chiefs of his people, who had rejected his

ourselves,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote31anc" HREF="#sdfootnote31sym"><SUP>31</SUP></A>

Nay, we consider you to be liars. &quot; He replied, &quot;O my

their Lord,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote36anc" HREF="#sdfootnote36sym"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
(Who knows their worth). But I see that you are adopting the attitude
of ignorance. And, O my people, who will help save me from Allah, if
I drive them away? Don't you understand this simple thing? And I do
not say to you that I possess treasures from Allah: nor do I say that
I have the knowledge of the unseen: nor do I claim to be an angel:<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote37anc" HREF="#sdfootnote37sym"><SUP>37</SUP></A>

shall be unjust, if I utter anything like this. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

It is a fact that they are in doubt and uncertainty about this, and
it is also a fact that your Lord will give them full measure for
their deeds, for He is fully aware of what they are doing. So, O
Muhammad, you and your companions, (who have turned back from
unbelief and rebellion to Faith and obedience), should stick firmly
to the Right Way, as you have been enjoined, and should not
transgress the bounds of submission. Allah is watching over what you
are doing. Do not incline even in the least towards the workers of
iniquity lest you should come within the reach of the Fire. Then you
will find no protector to defend you against Allah nor will you get
any help from any quarter. And listen! Establish Salat at the two
ends of the day and in the early part of the night.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote113anc" HREF="#sdfootnote113sym"><SUP>113</SUP></A>

righteous persons who should have forbidden the people to make
mischief in the land? If there were any, they were very few whom We
saved from among those communities. The wrong-doers, however, pursued

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">At the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The

	possessed nothing extraordinary to convince the people of his
	Prophethood except his pure character and his rational, and
	understandable Message. Then for the Quraish, there was nothing to
	warrant a torment from Allah except the rotten condition of their
	religion, morality and culture. On the contrary, there was
	&quot;prosperity&quot; to delude them that that was a sure sign of
	the favors of Allah and of their &quot;gods&quot; and &quot;goddesses&quot;,
	which was a clear proof that the ways they were following were the
	&quot;right&quot; ways. The inevitable result was that only a small
	minority of those people, who had sound minds and hearts, accepted
	the Message and the remaining large majority became hostile to it.
	Then some of them tried to suppress the Message by persecutions and
	some did their worst to defame it by false accusations and frivolous

	failure by their prejudice, indifference, ridicule, mockery and
	frivolous objections. You should go on following the Right Way with

	one and the same argument has been advanced to prove two things.
	First, the Qur'an has been revealed by Allah. Secondly, it proves
	the truth of the doctrine of Tauhid. The argument is this: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) &quot;You
	say that the Qur'an has not been revealed by Allah but has been

	forces, my claim that it has been revealed with Allah's knowledge
	has been proved absolutely, fully and completely.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) &quot;Then
	there was a two-fold challenge from the Qur'an to your deities but
	they utterly failed to meet it. They were challenged to come to your
	aid and help produce a book like the Qur'an. As they have not helped
	you, it is a clear proof that they are absolutely powerless and have
	no share at all in Godhead. You have seen that they have not only
	failed in this decisive test, but have also proved to be impotent to
	defend themselves against the open attacks made on them in this
	Book, which asks the people not to worship them for they have no
	share in the powers of Godhead. These things have proved that there
	is nothing Divine in them and you have made them your deities

	preceding verses, to refute the false excuses of the disbelievers
	mentioned therein for rejecting the Message of the Qur'an. This
	verse says that in general those people who rejected the Qur'an then
	(and are rejecting it now) were the worshipers of this world and its
	pleasures. As the root cause of their rejection was (and is) this
	false creed that there is nothing more valuable than the pleasures
	of this world and its material gains, there should be no
	restrictions (like the ones imposed in the Qur'an) on their

	is a clear and stern warning to the worshipers of the world. They
	should know that they will get the full reward for the exertions
	(whatever they be) they put forth in order to acquire the worldly
	gains but they should note it well that they would get nothing in
	the Next World. As they confined their efforts to the benefits of
	this world, and did nothing to earn the benefits of the Next World,
	they should expect nothing for the deeds they have done for the
	material gains of this world. In order to illustrate this, let us
	take the case of a person who desires to build a palace for himself
	in this world and adopts all those devices, measures and means which
	help build such a palace. Most surely, he will succeed in building a
	grand palace, for no brick will refuse to stick to its place simply
	because he was an unbeliever. But it is equally obvious that he
	shall have to leave behind in this world that grand palace along
	with all its furnishings as soon as he breathes his last breath. For
	there is no reason why the palace he had built (or done anything
	else) for this world, should be credited to him in the Next World,
	if he had done nothing to provide himself with a palace in the Next
	World. For only those who provide for themselves with the necessary
	material for a palace in the Next World in accordance with the
	Divine Law, deserve to get a palace there. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now a
	question arises in regard to the logical conclusion of this
	argument, according to which he should not get a palace in the Next
	World. It is this: &quot;Well, he may not get a palace, but why
	should he be thrown into the Fire of Hell? The answer is this (and
	the Qur'an itself has given this same answer in different places)
	that the one who exerts and works only for a palace in this world in
	utter disregard of the Hereafter, naturally and inevitably adopts
	such treasures and means as help build a large Fire for himself in
	the Hell. (Please refer to E.N. 12 of Yunus.)

	to say, &quot;Just see the madness of the old man! He wishes to
	float a ship on the land!&quot; For they could never imagine that
	after a few days, a ship would actually float there. Therefore

	the Bible its resting place was Mount Ararat in Armenia, which is
	one of the ranges of mountains of tire same name that extends from

	Mount Judi. For instance, Berasus, a religious leader of Babylonia,
	who lived about 250 years before Christ, says in his history of the
	Chaldeans that Noah's Ark rested upon Mount Judi. Abydenus, a pupil
	of Aristotle, not only confirms the same but also says that many
	people of `Iraq of his time possessed pieces of the Ark, which they
	ground in water and gave to the sick as a medicine.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the question: Did the Deluge mentioned here cover the
	whole earth or was it confined to that particular region where
	Prophet Noah lived? This is a question which has not been finally
	settled up to this day. As far as the Bible and the Israelite
	traditions are concerned, this was universal. (Genesis 7: 18-24).
	But the Qur'an is silent about it, though it does say things which
	show that the whole human race after the Deluge was the descendant
	of Prophet Noah and of those with him in the Ark, but this does not
	mean that the Deluge covered all the earth. It may be explained like
	this: at that time of the history the only region of the earth,
	which was inhabited by the human race, was the region in which Noah
	lived, and the generations which came after the Deluge, gradually
	spread over other parts of the earth. This theory is supported by
	two things. First, there is a conclusive proof that a great flood
	did come over the land of the Tigris and the Euphrates. This is
	confirmed by historical traditions, archaeological remains and
	geological evidence. But there are no such proofs in the other parts
	of the earth as might show that the Deluge was universal. Secondly,
	traditions have come down to almost all the peoples of the earth
	living even in distant places like America and Australia, that once
	a great flood had come all over the earth. The only conclusion which
	can be drawn from the above is that at one time the forefathers of
	all the people of the earth lived at one place. But, when afterwards
	they spread over different lands in the earth; they carried the
	traditions of the Deluge along with them. (Please refer to E.N. 47

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote49sym" HREF="#sdfootnote49anc">49</A>Allah
	has called the wicked son of Prophet Noah &quot;a worthless act&quot;,
	for children are entrusted by the Creator to the care of parents so
	that they may bring them up and train them to become &quot;good
	persons&quot; and fulfill the purpose for which He created man. If a
	father does his very best to &quot;process&quot; and turn the child
	into a righteous person, but fails in his efforts, the child, who
	was a sort of raw material in his hands, would be likened to a
	&quot;worthless act&quot;. It is obvious that the wicked son was a
	&quot;worthless act&quot;, for he was not the sort of &quot;good
	work&quot; which his father had desired him to be. So in this sense
	he did not belong to the family of Prophet Noah, whom the Creator
	had sent to mold all his people into &quot;Good acts&quot;,
	especially those who were of his own flesh and blood. Thus that
	unrighteous son had forfeited all the rights of blood he had with
	the Prophet as far as the torment of &quot;the Deluge&quot; was
	concerned. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the other question: Why was not the request of the
	Prophet regarding his own flesh and blood granted? The answer is
	this: If any part of the body of a man becomes so rotten that the
	surgeon is of the definite opinion that that part must be cut off
	for the sake of the safety of the rest of the body, the surgeon will
	not comply with the request of the man not to cut that part of his
	body, but will say, &quot;It is not a part of your body because it
	is rotten.&quot; This will not, however, mean that it was never
	actually a part of the body but will imply only this: &quot;As it
	has ceased to function tightly as a part of the body, it is no more
	a part of the body in the sense and for the purpose the healthy
	parts of the body ace its parts&quot; .Likewise, when it was said to
	Prophet Noah, &quot;He is not of your family,&quot; it did not
	negate the fact that he was from his loins but implied, &quot;He
	does not deserve to be treated as a member of your righteous family
	because of his spoiled morals and conduct. As the torment of the
	Deluge has been brought about to punish those who had sided with the
	unbelievers in the conflict of kufr and Faith, your son does not
	deserve to be rescued from it along with the believers. Had it been
	a conflict between your descendants and those of the unbelievers,
	the result would have been different, but this being a conflict
	between the righteous and the unrighteous, the former alone will be
	delivered from it.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	epithet, &quot;a worthless act&quot;, has been purposely applied to
	the son of Noah, for it is very meaningful. It points to the two
	different objects that the parents have in view in bringing up their
	children. Those parents who look merely at the surface of things,
	bring up and love their children because they are from their loins
	or their wombs, irrespective of the fact whether they are righteous
	or unrighteous. But this epithet requires the believers to look upon
	their children as &quot;pieces of work&quot; entrusted to them in a
	natural way by their Creator, so that they should prepare and mold
	them so as to fulfill the object for which Allah has created man.
	Therefore, if a certain parent fails in his efforts to mold his
	child in a way to fulfill the very object for which the child was
	entrusted to him and the latter becomes a servant of Satan instead
	of his Lord, the parent should regard all his efforts for the child
	to have gone utterly waste. In that case there is no reason why that
	parent should have any consideration for that &quot;worthless act&quot;.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As a
	corollary to the above, the same rule will apply to the other
	relationships of a believer. As a believer is one who believes in
	certain creeds and behaviors, all his relationships with the other
	people will be determined by those creeds and behaviors. If his
	blood relations have the qualities of a believer, their relationship
	with him becomes doubly stronger. But if they are void of the
	qualities of a believer; the believer will confine his relationship
	with them only to the extent of blood relationships and will have no
	spiritual relationship with them. Consequently, if such a relative
	comes face to face with the believer in the conflict between kufr
	and the Faith, the believer should fight with him just as he would
	with any other unbeliever.</P>

	from the lack of &quot;Faith&quot; or that his Faith had any tinge
	of weakness or that he had beliefs like those of the ignorant
	people. His response to this is rather a proof of his high moral
	character. As Noah was like the other Prophets, a human being, he
	also suffered from the common human weakness, that is, natural
	parental love for children. So he begged his Lord to deliver his son
	from the Deluge. Allah admonished him because the high character of
	a Prophet demanded that he ought not to have made such a request
	even for his own flesh and blood. That is why no sooner was the
	warning administered w him than he realized that he had come down
	from the high position of a Prophet to the level of a mere father
	because of the critical psychological human weakness. Therefore
	immediately after the warning, he repented of his weakness, and
	behaved as if his own son had not been drowned in the Deluge a
	moment before this. This character shown by him is a clear proof
	that he was a true Prophet. He returned to the same height and
	meekly asked his Lord's forgiveness for showing any concern for his

	wording of their answer shows that Prophet Abraham had understood
	from their refusal to cat that they were angels. But he was afraid
	of their visit because he knew that the coming of the angels in the
	human shape did not bode well: So he was fearful that they might
	have come to take them to task for some offense committed by the
	people of his household or of his habitation or by himself. Had it
	been the same thing that the commentators presumed, then their
	answer should have been, &quot;Don't fear us for we are angels from
	your Lord. &quot; But the answer they gave to remove his fear,
	&quot;Don't have any fear for we have been sent to the people of Lot
	(and not to you),&quot; shows that Abraham knew that they were
	angels but was troubled in his mind as to the reason of their visit
	in the human shape. This was because the angels came in human shape
	when some one was either to be put to a hard trial or punished

	superficial view of this incident from the life of Prophet Abraham
	in the context it occurs might lead one to consider it to be
	irrelevant, especially as an introduction to the coming scourge on
	the people of Lot. But if one reviews this in the light of the
	object for which these historical events have been related here, one
	will come to the conclusion that its mention is most apt here. In
	order to understand its relevancy we should keep in view the
	following two things: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) These
	historical events have been related here to warn the Quraish that
	they were absolutely wrong in their self-delusion that they were
	quite immune from the scourge with which the Qur'an was threatening
	them because of their relationship with Prophet Abraham and their
	guardianship of the Ka`abah and their religious, economic and
	political leadership of Arabia. They thought that Prophet Abraham,
	whose descendants they were, was a beloved servant of Allah and,
	would, therefore, intercede for them and defend them against any
	scourge from Him. That is why the graphic picture of the death of
	Prophet Noah's son has been drawn to show that the prayer of a great
	Prophet like him could not save his own son from the scourge. Not
	only was his prayer rejected but he was also taken to task for
	making a request for his wicked son. Then this second incident from
	the life of Prophet Abraham has been related to show that, though
	Allah was very kind to him, He rejected his appeal for the people of
	Lot because he had tried to intercede for the wicked people, which
	was against the requirements of justice.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) This
	incident from the life of Prophet Abraham has been related along
	with , the destruction of the people of Lot for another object as
	well. The Quraish had forgotten that the Law of Divine Justice had
	always been operating continuously and regularly and there were open
	proofs of this all around them. On the one hand, there was the case
	of Prophet Abraham. He had to leave his home for the sake of the
	Truth and righteousness and to live in a foreign country where to
	all appearances, he had no outward power to support him. But Divine
	Justice rewarded him for his righteousness with a son like Isaac and
	a grandson like Jacob (Allah's peace be upon them) whose
	descendants, the Israelites, reigned supreme for centuries over the
	same Palestine where he had taken refuge as a stranger. On the other
	hand, there were the people of Lot who were living nearby in great
	prosperity, which had intoxicated them so much that they lived in
	open wickedness, totally forgetting that they would be overtaken by
	retribution from Allah. So much so that they scoffed at the
	admonition of Prophet Lot. But Divine Justice came into operation at
	the same time, when it was conveying the good news to Prophet
	Abraham and decreed that those wicked people should be annihilated
	from the face of the earth. As a result of this, no vestige of their
	habitations was left on the surface of the earth. This fact should
	serve as a lesson to the wicked people for all times.

	the tenor of the details of the story as given in the different
	parts of the Qur'an, it becomes quite plain that the angels came to
	Prophet Lot in the shape of handsome boys and that he was unaware
	that they were angels. That is why he was troubled and distressed in
	his mind, for he knew how wicked and shameless were his people.&nbsp;

	&quot;my daughters&quot; Prophet Lot might have meant either of the
	two things. He might have referred to the daughters of the community
	as &quot;ray daughters&quot; because the relationship of a Prophet
	to his people is as of a father to his children. But it is also
	possible that he aught have meant by this his own daughters. Anyhow
	this could not have been an offer of adultery, for the succeeding
	sentence &quot;..these are purer for you&quot; leaves no room for
	such a misunderstanding. This makes it quite obvious that Prophet
	Lot admonished them in this way so as to turn them to the females
	for the lawful gratification of their sexual desires instead of
	seeking unnatural ways.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote88">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote88sym" HREF="#sdfootnote88anc">88</A>This
	answer of the people of Lot shows that they had gone to the lowest
	depth of depravity and openly and brazen-facedly declared that they
	did not want females but males. This was the proof that they had not
	only left the natural way of purity and strayed into the unnatural
	way of impurity but had also lost all interest in the natural way of
	gratification. Such a depraved condition is the worst form of moral
	degradation, for it shows that no good has been left at all.
	Supposing a person has fallen a victim to an unlawful and sinful
	behavior but at the same time considers it to be a wrong behavior
	which should be avoided. There is hope for the reform of such a
	person, and even if he does not mend his way the utmost that can be
	said about him is that 'he is a depraved person'. On the other hand,
	if a person gives himself wholly to the unlawful because he has no
	interest in the lawful, such a filthy person is not worthy of being
	considered a man at all, and therefore should be wiped out of the
	earth. That is why Allah decreed that the people of Lot should be

	always been strongly hated by all un-godly wicked people. This
	hatred may also be noticed today among those who deliberately intend
	to follow the wicked ways, for they consider religious observances
	to be the greatest threat to their evil ways. As they regard Salat
	to be a symbol of the corning trouble, they begin to taunt the one
	who observes it. For they know that the victim of the &quot;disease&quot;
	of religiosity will not rest content with his own reformation but
	will exert his utmost to reform others as well. They fear that he
	will preach piety and righteous ways to them and criticize their

	the taunts of wicked people. And if the person who observes Salat

<DIV ID="sdfootnote97">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote97sym" HREF="#sdfootnote97anc">97</A>These
	two things clearly distinguish the theory of the way of &quot;ignorance&quot;
	from, the theory of the way of &quot;Islam&quot;. The way of
	&quot;ignorance&quot; is based on the assumption that one should
	follow the way of one's forefathers: and for the mere reason that it
	has been inherited from one's forefathers. Its second assumption is
	that one's faith and religion are concerned only with worship, and
	these have nothing to do with the worldly affairs of life, in which
	one is absolutely free to do as one pleases. On the other hand, the
	basic theory of Islam is that every way that is not founded on the
	submission to Allah is wrong, and, therefore, should not be
	followed, for no other way has got any proof of its truth from
	reason, knowledge and revelation. Besides, Islam is not confined to
	the worship of Allah but it covers in its entirety all aspects of
	life-cultural, social, economic and political. This is because all
	that man possesses really belongs to Allah and, therefore, man has
	absolutely no right to do as he pleases with his possessions.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Incidentally,
	this demand of the people of Prophet Shua'ib that they had every
	right to do as they pleased with their goods and possessions shows
	that there is nothing new about the theory of the division of life
	into separate compartments, religious and mundane. Some three
	thousand years or so ago they insisted on this division just as
	Western and Westernized people insist on it today. And they are
	absolutely wrong to presume that their division is the result of the
	`light' that had dawned upon humanity because of the &quot;intellectual
	progress&quot; that man has made as a result of the evolutionary
	process. Thus it is clear that it is not light but darkness which
	prevailed with the same intensity thousands of years ago as it is
	today and that the conflict of Islam against it is also as old as
	that.

	&quot;Suppose one of you was traveling in a waterless desert and
	lost his camel on whom he had laden all his provisions for-the
	journey. He made a thorough search for the missing camel, but in
	vain. Then, in despair of his life, he lay down tinder a tree. When,

	sudden before him. Just imagine his happiness. Allah is more pleased
	than that man, when a sinful servant returns to Him in penitence.&quot;
	There. is another incident even more effective than this related by
	Hadrat `Umar: &quot;Once some prisoners of war were brought before
	the Holy Prophet. One of thetas was a mother whose infant child had
	been lost. This had made her so restless and uneasy that she would
	hold any child she came across close to her breasts and suckle it.
	When the Holy Prophet saw this; he put this question to the
	bystanders: 'Can you imagine that this mother would ever throw her
	own child into the fire?' We replied, 'Never'; not to speak of
	throwing it into the fire, she would do her utmost in every possible
	way to prevent it from falling into the fire' . &quot; Then the Holy
	Prophet said. &quot;Allah is much more merciful to His servants than
	this mother is to her child.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Let us

	has created love in the hearts of the mother and the father for

	shown the care and the sacrifice they shower on their child; nay,
	they would have even become its enemies because of the trouble and

	thing in a Tradition: &quot;On the Day of Resurrection, the banner
	of the poets of &quot;ignorance&quot; will be in the hands of
	Imra-ul-Quais, and all of them will march towards Hell under his
	leadership.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us try to picture the march-past of these two processions. It is
	obvious that the first procession will march happily and joyously,
	praying for and praising their leaders whose guidance had led them
	to this happy state of marching to the blessed Paradise. On the
	other hand, when the followers of the leaders of errors will find
	themselves in the miserable plight, to which the leaders had brought
	them, naturally their anger against them will be beyond description.
	For the followers will march towards Hell, abusing and cursing their
	leaders, who had brought them to that horrible state of torture.

	is, &quot;In these historical events there is a sign which will show
	conclusively to the one who considers this deeply that the torment
	of the Hereafter is inevitable, as warned by the Messengers. One can
	also judge from this how terrible it will be. This knowledge will
	fill one with such fear that will keep one on the Straight Way.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the question: How are these historical events a Sign of
	the Hereafter and the chastisement therein. Everyone who makes a
	critical study of history with this consideration that it is not
	merely a collection of events but also a means of drawing logical
	conclusions, will find that the rise and fall of communities and
	nations has been taking place in a regular succession. Moreover, one
	will find that this rise and fall takes place in accordance with
	some moral laws in an extraordinary way. This is a clear proof that
	man is subordinate to the Sovereign, Who is ruling over the universe
	in accordance with some rational moral laws. Accordingly, He raises
	up those who keep the moral limits above a certain minimum standard
	set for this purpose and degrades those who fall below it. Then He
	gives respite to the latter to mend their ways, but if they do not
	avail of it and continue their downward march and fall below the
	limit set for their complete degradation, He annihilates them in a
	way as to serve as a lesson for others. The fact that these events
	always take place in a regular cycle leaves no shadow of doubt that
	rewards and punishments are permanent parts of the law of His
	Kingdom.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A further
	consideration of the chastisements that were inflicted on different
	communities shows that, though these punishments fulfilled the
	demands of justice to some extent, there was still need of more to
	fulfill all the demands of justice, for these criminals were
	punished only for those sins which they themselves committed but not
	for those committed by the succeeding communities, which followed
	the bad example left by them as their predecessors. It is obvious
	from the study of history that the law of retribution must take its
	course and justice demands that they should be punished for the evil
	legacy they left for others to follow after them. Commonsense and
	justice demand that life in this world should be reproduced in its
	entirety in order to fulfill all the demands of the law of
	retribution. The just Sovereign will, therefore, bring into
	existence all those people for this purpose and award them due
	punishments.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote115sym" HREF="#sdfootnote115anc">115</A>In
	this passage, the real cause of the fall of the communities
	mentioned in vv. 25-99 has been pointed out in a very instructive
	manner. In reviewing their history Allah declares that the cause of
	the downfall of not only these but of all the former communities was
	this: when Allah bestowed His favors on them, they abused these
	favors and were so intoxicated with their own prosperity that they
	began to make mischief in the land. By and by their collective
	conscience became so corrupt that no righteous persons were left
	among them to forbid evil, and, if a few were left, their voice was
	so weak that they could not prevent them from causing mischief. As a
	result of this, evil became so strong and prevalent among them as to
	warrant the scourge of Allah. Otherwise Allah bears no enmity
	against His servants that He should destroy them without any just
	cause, while they were performing righteous works. This has been
	mentioned here for impressing the following three things: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, it
	is imperative that there should be some persons who should invite
	the people to virtue and forbid evil. For Allah approves virtue only
	and tolerates evil for its sake so long as there is any potential
	good left in them. But when a community has no righteous persons
	left in it and contains only wicked ones, or even if there be some
	such righteous persons in it as are so weak that nobody pays any
	heed to them, and the community as a whole rushes headlong towards
	moral degradation, then Allah's scourge becomes its inevitable doom.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second, a
	community, which tolerates everything and everyone except those few
	who invite it to righteous deeds seals its own doom and invites its
	destruction.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Third, it
	is clear from this passage that the destiny of a community is
	determined by the influence the righteous people can wield in it. If
	it contains such a number of good persons as may be able to
	eradicate evil and mischief and establish virtue and righteousness,
	a general scourge is withheld from it so as to afford an opportunity
	to them for carrying on their work of reform. On the other hand, if
	the number of the righteous persons in it remains too small to carry
	on the reform work, and the community does not tolerate them at all
	and does not allow them to perform their 'reform work, then that
	community incurs its own destruction, for thus it proves itself to
	be a worthless community which has no justification for its
	existence. (For further explanation, See E.N. 34 of LI).</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote116">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote116sym" HREF="#sdfootnote116anc">116</A>This
	is the answer to the objection raised in the name of (taqdir)
	(destiny) against the principle that has been laid down in the
	preceding verse for the destruction of the wicked communities. It is
	this: Why should these communities be punished for lack of a
	sufficient number of righteous persons in them? Why didn't Allah
	Himself will to produce that sufficient number of righteous persons
	in it? Allah has answered this objection, so as to say: &quot;It is
	not the will of Allah to .bind mankind inherently to a fixed course
	of life as He has bound the vegetable and animal life. Had it been
	so, there would have been no need of sending the Messengers and the
	Books for inviting mankind to the Faith. For in that case all human
	beings would have been born-Muslims and born Believers and there
	would have been no unbelief and no disobedience. But it is the will
	of Allah to grant freedom of choice and action to man so that he may
	be free to choose and follow any way of life. That is why He has
	left open both the way to Paradise and the way to Hell for man and
	given every individual and every community the opportunity to choose
	and follow either of the two ways with full freedom and win any of
	the two abodes as a result of one's own efforts and exertions. It is
	obvious that this scheme of Allah demands that it should be based on
	the freedom of choice and the option to adopt Faith or unbelief.
	This is why Allah does not compel a community to the right way if it
	itself intends to follow the wrong way, and plans and works for it.
	Allah's scheme does not interfere with the plans and works of such a
	community. When it makes deliberate arrangements to mold the wicked,
	unjust, and sinful people, He does not supply it with righteous
	persons by birth to set it right. Every community is free to produce
	good or bad people as it wills. And if a community wills to follow a
	wrong way as a community, leaving little room for the production and
	the development of the righteous people in order to raise up the
	standard of virtue, God does not will to coerce it to follow the
	righteous way. He will let it follow the way it chooses for itself
	with its inevitable consequences. On the contrary, Allah shows His
	mercy to that community which produces a sufficiently large number
	of such people as accept the invitation to virtue, and leaves room
	in its collective system for such people to work for its reform and
	purification. (For further explanation, See E.N. 24 of VI).
