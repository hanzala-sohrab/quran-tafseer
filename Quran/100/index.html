<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For
this purpose the general chaos and confusion prevailing in Arabia,
with which the whole country was in turmoil, has been presented as an
argument. Bloodshed, loot and plunder raged on every side. Tribes
were subjecting tribes to raids, and no one could have peaceful sleep
at night from fear that some enemy tribe might raid his settlement
early in the morning. Every Arab was fully conscious of this state of
affairs and realized that it was wrong. Although the plundered
bemoaned his miserable, helpless state and the plunderer rejoiced,
yet when the plunderer himself was plundered, he too realized how
abject was the condition in which the whole nation was involved.
Referring to this very state of affairs, it has been said, Unaware of
the second life after death and his accountability before God in it,
man has become ungrateful to his Lord and Sustainer. He is using the
powers and abilities given by God for perpetrating tyranny and
pillage; blinded by the love of worldly wealth he tries to obtain it
by every means, however impure and filthy, and his own state itself
testifies that by abusing the powers bestowed by his Lord he is being
ungrateful to Him. He would never have behaved so, had he known the
time when the dead will be raised from the graves, and when the
intentions and motives with which he had done all sorts of deeds in
the world, will be exposed and brought out before everyone to see. At
that time the Lord and Sustainer of men shall be well informed of
what one had done and what punishment or reward one deserved. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>There
	is no indication in the words of the verse to show whether &quot;those
	who run&quot; imply the horses; only the word waI-`Adiyat (by, those
	who run) has been used. That is why the commentators have disputed
	as to what is implied by &quot;those who run&quot; ..One section of
	the Companions and their immediate successors has been to think that
	it implies the horses; another section says that it implies the
	camels. But since the peculiar sound called dabh is produced only by
	the panting, snorting horses, and the following verses also in which
	mention has been made of striking sparks and raiding a settlement
	early at dawn and raising clouds of dust, apply only to the horses,
	most scholars are of the opinion that horses are meant. Ibn Jarir
	says: &quot;Of the two views this view is preferable that by &quot;those
	who run&quot; horses are implied, for the camel does not breathe
	hard in running, it is the horse which does so, and Allah has said:
	&quot;By those runners which pant and breathe hard in running.&quot;
	Imam Razi ays: &quot;The words of these verses proclaim that horses
	are meant, for the sound of dabh (panting breath) is only produced
	by the horses, and the act of striking sparks of fire with the hoofs
	too is associated with the horses, and, likewise, mounting of a raid
	early at. dawn is easier by means of the horses than by other
	animals.&quot;&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>The
	practice among the Arabs was that when they had to mount a raid on a
	settlement, they marched out in the night so as to take the enemy by
	surprise; then they would launch a sudden attack early. in the
	morning so that everything became visible in the light of day, and
	at the same tune it did not become so bright that the victim could
	notice their movement from a distance and be ready to meet the
	offensive.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote4">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>This
	is for which an oath has been sworn by the horses, which run with
	panting breath and dash off sparks at night, then raising dust rush
	to assault a settlement at dawn and penetrate into the enemy host.
	It is astonishing to note that a large number of the commentators
	have taken these horses to imply the horses of the Muslim fighters
	and the enemy host to imply the host of disbelievers, whereas the
	oath has been sworn to impress the point that &quot;man is highly
	ungrateful to his Lord&quot;. Now, obviously, in the course of Jihad
	for the sake of Allah, the rushing forth of the fighters' horses and
	their assaulting a host of disbelievers all of a sudden, does not at
	all support the point that man is ungrateful to his Lord, nor the
	following sentences, viz. &quot;man himself is a witness to it, and
	he. loves the worldly wealth with all his heart,&quot; apply to the
	people who go out to fight in the cause of Allah. Therefore, one
	will have to admit that the oaths sworn in the first five verses of
	this Sarah, refer, in fact, to the general bloodshed, loot and
	plunder prevalent in Arabia at that time. In the pre-Islamic days of
	ignorance the night was a very dreadful thing: in it the people of
	every tribe and settlement apprehended the danger of a sudden attack
	by some unknown enemy, and when the light of day appeared they would
	heave a sigh of relief that the night had passed in peace. The
	tribes did not fight only retaliatory wars but different tribes also
	raided others in order to deprive them of their worldly goods and
	herds and to capture their women and children to be made slaves.
	This kind of tyranny and plunder was carried opt mostly by means of
	the horses, which Allah is presenting here as an argument for the
	fact that man is ungrateful to his Lord. That is the powers which
	man is employing for fighting, shedding blood and plundering had not
	been given him by God for this purpose. Therefore this indeed is
	sheer ingratitude that the resources granted by Allah and the power
	given by Him should be used for causing chaos and corruption to
	spread in the earth. which Allah abhors.&nbsp;

	&quot;He is most ardent in the love of khair&quot;. But the word
	khair is not only used for goodness and virtue in Arabic but also
	for worldly wealth. In Surah Baqarah: 180, khair has been used in
	the meaning of worldly wealth. The context itself shows where khair
	has been used in the sense of goodness and where in that of worldly
	goods. The context of this verse clearly shows that here khair means
	worldly wealth and not virtue and goodness. For about the man who is
	ungrateful to his Lord and who by his conduct is himself testifying
	to his ingratitude it cannot be said that he is very ardent in the
	love of goodness and virtue.&nbsp;

	is all the intentions aims and objects, ideas and thoughts and the
	motives behind acts and deeds that lie hidden in the hearts will be
	exposed and examined in .order to sort out the good from the evil.
	In other words judgment will not be passed only on the apparent and
	superficial as to what a man practically did but the secrets hidden
	in the hearts also will be brought out to see what were the
	intentions and motives under which a man did what he did. If man
	only considers this he cannot help admitting that real and complete
	justice cannot be done anywhere except in the Court of God. Secular
	laws of the world also admit in principle that a person should not
	be punished merely on the basis of his apparent act but his motive
	for so acting also should be seen and examined. But no court of the
	world has the means by which it may accurately as certain the motive
	and intention. This can be done only by God: He alone can examine
	the underlying motives behind every apparent act of man as well as
	take the decision as to what reward or punishment he deserves. Then,
	as is evident from the words of the verse, this judgment will not be
	passed merely on the basis of the knowledge which Allah already has
	about the intentions and motives of the hearts, but on Resurrection
	Day these secrets will be exposed and brought out openly before the
	people and after a thorough scrutiny in the Court it will be shown
	what was the good in it and what was the evil. That is why the words
	hussila ma fis-sudur have been used. Tahsil means to bring out
	something in the open, and to sort out different things from one
	another. Thus, the use of tahsil concerning hidden secrets of the
	hearts contains both the meanings: to expose them and to sort out
	the good from the evil. This same theme has been expressed in Surah
	At-Tariq, thus: &quot;The Day the hidden secrets are held to
	scrutiny.&quot; (v. 9)</P>
