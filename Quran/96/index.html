herself heard it from the Holy Messenger of Allah. Besides, Ibn
Abbas, Abu Musa al-Ashari and a group of the Companions also are
reported to have stated that these were the very first verses of the
Quran to be revealed to the Holy Prophet. The second part was sent
down afterwards when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) began to
perform the prescribed Prayer in the precincts of the Kabah and Abu

traditionists have related on the strength of their respective
authorities the story of the beginning of revelation from Imam
Az-Zuhri, who had it from Hadrat Urwah bin Zubair, who had it from
Hadrat Aishah, his aunt. She states that revelations to the Holy
Prophet (upon whom be peace) began in the form of true (according to
other traditions, good) visions. Whichever vision he saw it seemed as
though he saw it in broad daylight. Afterwards solitude became dear
to him and he would go to the Cave of Hira to engage in worship there
for several days and nights (Hadrat Aishah has used the word

devotional exercises. This was some kind of worship which he
performed, for until then he had not been taught the method of
performing the Prayer by Allah). He would take provisions with him
and stay there for several days, then would return to Hadrat Khadijah
who would again provide for him for a few more days. One day when he
was in the Cave of Hira, Revelation came down to him unexpectedly and
the Angel said, to him: &quot;Read&quot;.</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
the Holy Messenger (upon whom be peace) returned home to Hadrat
Khadijah trembling with fear, and said to her: `Cover me, cover me',
and he was covered. When terror left him, he said: `O Khadijah, what
has happened to me?' Then he narrated to her whatever had happened,
and said: `I fear for my life'. She said; `No never! Be of good
cheer. By God, never will God debase you: you treat the kindred well,
you speak the truth, (one tradition adds: you restore what is
entrusted to you), you bear the burden of the helpless, you help the
poor, you entertain the guests, and you cooperate in good works.' </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
she took him to Waraqah bin Naufal, who was her cousin. He had become
a Christian in pre-Islamic days, wrote the Gospel in Arabic and
Hebrew, and had become very old and blind. Hadrat Khadijah said:
`Brother, listen to the son of your brother.' Waraqah said to the
Holy Prophet: `What have you seen, nephew?' The Holy Prophet
described what he had seen. Waraqah said; `This is the same Gabriel
(the Angel of Revelation) which Allah had sent down to Moses. Would
that I were a young man during your Prophethood! Would that I were
alive when your tribe would expel you!' The Holy Prophet said: `Will
they expel me?' Waraqah said; `Yes, never has it so happened that a
person brought what you have brought and was not treated as an enemy.
If I live till then I would help you with all the power at my
command.' But not very long after this Waraqah died.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
narrative is explicit that even until a moment before the coming
Angel the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom be His peace) was
without any expectation that he was going to be appointed a Prophet.
Nothing to say of any such wish or expectation, he did not even have
any idea that he would meet with such an experience. Coming down of
the Revelation and appearing of the Angel face to face was an
unexpected accident for him the first effect of which on him was
precisely the same as could naturally be on a person meeting with
such a tremendous experience, in the absence of any preparation. That
is why when he proclaimed the message of Islam, the people of Makkah
raised all sorts of objections, but no one said that they were
already apprehending that he would make a claim, for he had been
making preparations since long to become a Prophet. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From
this narrative another thing which also becomes obvious is how pure
was the Holy Prophet's life and how sublime was his character before
Prophethood, Hadrat Khadijah was no young lady: she was 55 years old
at the time this event took place and had been the Holy Prophet's
life companion for 15 years. No weakness of the husband can remain
hidden from the wife. She had during this long period of married life
found him to be such a generous and noble man that when he told her
of his experience in the Cave of Hira', she admitted without the
least hesitation that it was indeed Allah's own Angel who had come to
him with Revelation. Likewise, Waraqah bin Naufal also was an old
inhabitant of Makkah, who had seen the Holy Prophet grow up from
childhood. Particularly, for the past 15 years because of the close
relationship he was even more intimately aware of his life, his
Affairs and dealings. When he also heard of his experience, he did
not regard it as an evil suggestion, but immediately said that it was
the same Gabriel who had descended on Moses (peace be upon him). This
meant that even according to him the Holy Prophet was such a sublime
person that there was nothing surprising in his being elevated to the
office of Prophethood. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

second part of thee Surah was revealed when the Holy Messenger of
Allah began to perform the Prayer in the Islamic way in the Ka'bahand

happened that after his appointment to Prophethood even before he
could start preaching Islam openly, he began to perform the Prayer in
the precincts of the Ka'bahin the way Allah taught him; and from this
the Quraish felt for the first time that he had adopted a new
religion. The other people were watching it with curiosity, but Abu

Abu Huraira says that Abu Jahl asked the people of Quraish: &quot;Does
Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) set his face on
the ground before you?&quot;When they replied in the affirmative, he
said:&quot;By Lat and Uzza, if I ever catch him in that act of
worship, I would set my foot on his neck and rub his face in the
dust.&quot;Then it so happened that he saw the Holy Messenger in that
posture and came forward to set his foot on his neck, but suddenly
turned back as if in a fright and being asked what was the matter, he
said there was a ditch of fire and a terrible apparition between
himself and Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) and
some wings. On hearing this the Holy Prophet remarked:&quot;Had he
come near me, the angels would have smitten and torn him to pieces.&quot;

he said: &quot;If he acted so, the angels would seize him there and

Abu Jahl passed that way and said: &quot;O Muhammad, did I not forbid

	words of the Revelation before him in the written form and had asked

	anything of His knowledge save what He Himself may please to
	reveal.&quot; (Al-Baqarah: 255). Whatever man looks upon as his own

	he was only made aware that the Being Whom he already knew and
	acknowledged as his Lord and Sustainer was in direct communion with
	him, had started sending down Revelations to him, and had appointed
	him as His Prophet. Then after an intermission the opening verses of
	Surah al-Muddaththir were revealed in which he was told what mission
	he had to perform after his appointment to Prophethood. (For

	Servant&quot; : the Holy Messenger of Allah himself. The Holy
	Prophet has been mentioned by this epithet at several places in the
	Qur'an. For example, &quot;Glory be to Him Who transported His
	servant one night from the Masjid al Haram to the distant Temple.&quot;
	(Bani Isra'il: 1); &quot;All praise is for Allah Who has sent down
	this Book to His servant.&quot; (AI-Kahf: 1); &quot;And that when
	the servant of Allah stood up to pray, the people got ready to
	assault him.&quot; (Al-Jinn: 19). This shows that it is a special
	style of love by which Allah makes mention of His Messenger Muhammad
	(upon whom be His peace and blessings) in His Book. Besides, it also
	shows that Allah after appointing His Messenger to Prophethood had
	taught him the method of performing the Prayer. There is no mention
	of this method anywhere in the Qur'an, saying: &quot;O Prophet,
	perform the Prayer in this and this way.&quot; Hence, this is
	another proof that the Revelation sent down to the Holy Prophet did
	not only consist of what has been recorded in the Qur'an, but
	besides this, other things also were taught to him by revelation,
	which are not recorded in the Qur'an.&nbsp;
