<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There
is no authentic tradition to show as to when exactly this Surah was
sent down. A study of the subject matter, however, reveals that its
period of revelation is the second stage of the Holy Prophet's life
at Makkah, which lasted from the third year of the Prophethood till
the fifth year. We have given the characteristics of this period in
the Introduction to the Sarah Al-An'am. In view of those
characteristics it can be said that this Surah might have been sent
down in about the 5th year, when the antagonism of the disbelievers
had become quite intense but had not yet assumed tyrannical
proportions. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Authentic
traditions show that the Holy Prophet used to recite this Surah
generally in the Prayer on the Eid days. A woman named Umm Hisham bin
Harithah, who was a neighbor of the Holy Prophet, says that she was
able to commit Surah Qaf to memory only because she often heard it
from the Holy Prophet in the Friday sermons. According to some other
traditions he often recited it in the Fajr Prayer. This makes it
abundantly clear that this was an important Surah in the sight of the
Holy Prophet. That is why he made sure that its contents reached as
many people as possible over and over again. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
reason for this importance can be easily understood by a careful
study of the Surah. The theme of the entire Surah is the Hereafter.
When the Holy Prophet started preaching his message in Makkah what
surprised the people most was the news that people would be
resurrected after death, and they would have to render an account of
their deeds. They said that that was impossible; human mind could not
believe that that would happen. After all, how could it be possible
that when the body had disintegrated into dust the scattered
particles would be reassembled after hundreds of thousands of years
to make up the same body once again and raised up as a living body,
Allah in response sent down this discourse. In it, on the one hand,
arguments have been given for the possibility and occurrence of the
Hereafter in a brief way, in short sentences, and, on the other, the
people have been warned, as if to say: &quot;Whether you express
wonder and surprise, or you regard it as something remote from
reason, or deny it altogether, in any case it cannot change the
truth. The absolute, un-alterable truth is that Allah knows the
whereabouts of each and every particle of your body that has
scattered away in the earth, and knows where and in what state it is.
Allah's one signal is enough to make all the scattered particles
gather together again and to make you rise up once again as you had
been made in the first instance. Likewise, your this idea that you
have been created and left free to yourselves in the world and that
you have not been made answerable to anyone, is no more than a
misunderstanding. The fact is that not only is Allah Himself directly
aware of each act and word of yours, even of the ideas that pass in
your mind, but His angels also are attached to each one of you, who
are preserving the record of whatever you do and utter. When the time
comes, you will come out of your graves at one call just as young
shoots of vegetable sprout up from the earth on the first shower of
the rain. Then this heedlessness which obstructs your vision will be
removed and you will see with your own eyes all that you are denying
today. At that time you will realize that you had not been created to
be irresponsible in this world but accountable to all your deeds the
meeting out of the rewards and punishments, the Hell and Heaven,
which you regard as impossible and imaginary things, will at that
time become visible realities for you in consequence of your enmity
and opposition to the Truth you will be cast into the same Hell which
you regard as remote from reason today and the ones who fear the
Merciful God and return to the path of righteousness, will be
admitted to the same Paradise at whose mention you now express wonder
and surprise. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	word &quot;majid&quot; is used for expressing two meanings in
	Arabic: for expressing the high rank, status, honor and dignity of a
	person, and for saying that somebody is highly generous, charitable
	and beneficent. This word has been used for the Qur'an in both these

	of the world can be brought up against it. It is a miracle both in
	its language and literary excellence and in its teaching and wisdom.
	Humans were helpless to produce the like of it at the time when it
	was sent down and are likewise helpless even today. Nothing of it
	could ever be proved wrong in any age, nor can anything of it be
	proved wrong in the present age. Falsehood can neither attack it
	from the front nor from the rear, and defeat it. And it is generous
	and beneficent in the sense that the more a man goes on trying to
	gain guidance from it, the more of guidance it goes on giving him,
	and the more he follows and obeys its commands and instructions the
	more he continues to be blessed with good, things of the world and

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>This
	sentence is a unique example of eloquence. In it a vast subject has
	been compressed into a few brief words. The object for which an oath
	has been sworn by the Qur'an has not been mentioned. In stood, a
	subtle gap has been left and the sentence is resumed with &quot;nay&quot;.
	If one thinks a little and also keeps in view the background in
	which this has been said, one comes to know what-is the subject of
	the gap that has been left between the oath and &quot;nay&quot;. In
	fact, what has been sworn of is this: &quot;The people of Makkah
	have not refused to acknowledge the Prophet hood of Muhammad (upon
	whom be Allah's peace and blessings) for any sound reason but for
	the highly unsound reason that a member of their own kind and an
	individual of their own nation has conic to them as a Warner from
	God and this is something highly surprising for them; whereas what
	would actually be surprising was if God had remained unconcerned
	about the well-being and adversity of His servants and made no
	arrangement whatever to warn them; or had sent a non-human to warn
	the human beings; or a Chinese to warn the Arabs. Therefore, this
	basis of the denial is absolutely unsound, and a reasonable person
	cannot but admit that there must exist some arrangement from God to
	warn the servants, and in the form that the Warner himself should be
	a person from among the people to whom he is sent.&quot; As for the
	question whether Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)
	is the person whom God has sent on this mission, no other evidence
	is needed to settle it but this glorious and beneficent Qur'an,
	which he is presenting; this is by itself enough to provide a proof
	of it. This explanation shows that in this verse an oath has been
	sworn by the Qur'an to impress the point that Muhammad (upon whom be
	Allah's peace and blessings) is really the Messenger of Allah and
	the disbelievers' surprise and wonder about his apostleship is
	misplaced, and the fact of the Qur'an's being &quot;majid&quot; is a
	proof of this claim. &nbsp;

	reasoning is this: `Your conjecture about God Who made this sphere
	of the earth a suitable home for living creatures and Who by
	combining the lifeless clay of the earth with the lifeless water
	from the sky produced such a fine vegetable life that you witness
	flourishing in the form of your gardens and crops, and W ho made the
	vegetation a means of sustenance for both man and beast, that He has
	no power to resurrect you after death, is a foolish and absurd
	conjecture. You witness almost daily the phenomenon that a land is
	lying barren and lifeless; then as soon as it receives a shower of
	rain, it gives birth to an endless train of life all of a sudden,
	the roots lying dead for ages sprout up and a variety of insects
	emerge playfully from the layers of the earth. This is a manifest
	proof that life after death is not impossible. When you cannot deny
	this express observation of yours, how can you deny that when Allah
	wills, you too will sprout up from the earth as the vegetation
	sprouts up. In this connection, one may note that in many parts of
	Arabia it does not sometimes rain for as long as five years at a
	stretch and sometimes even for longer periods the land does not
	receive even a drop of rain. For such long intervals in the burning
	deserts it is not conceivable that the roots of grass and the
	insects of the earth would survive. In spite of this when a little
	of the rain falls at some place, grass sprouts up and the insects of
	the earth return to life. Therefore, the inhabitants of Arabia can
	understand this reasoning much better than those people who do not
	have to experience such long periods of drought. &nbsp;

	is a reasoning from history for the Hereafter. In the preceding six

	in these the historical end of the nations of Arabia and the
	adjoining lands has been presented as an argument to prove that the
	doctrine of the Hereafter which all the Prophets have been
	presenting, is the very truth, for whichever nation denied it became
	involved in the moral degeneration of the worst kind with the result
	that the torment of God descended on it and eliminated it from the
	world. This necessary result of the denial of the Hereafter and
	moral perversion which one can witness throughout history, is an
	express proof of the fact that man has not been created to be
	irresponsible in this world, but he has necessarily to render an
	account of his deeds as soon as the time limit for action at his
	disposal comes to an end. That is why whenever he works in the world
	irresponsibly, his whole lift pattern is set on the path of ruin. If
	evil and wrong results go on following a course of action

	excellently ordered Universe and the creation of man in it as a mere
	accident, cannot help but admit that God alone has created man and
	this whole Universe. Now this actual fact that we exist alive in

	would not have been able to create all this in the first instance.
	When He has created the Universe in the first instance and we

	is, Although he could not see the Merciful God and could not
	perceive Him by his senses in any way, yet he feared His
	disobedience. His heart was more dominated by the fear of the unseen
	Merciful God than the fear of other perceptible powers and visible
	and mighty beings, and in spite of knowing that He is All-Merciful,
	he did not become a sinner, trusting His Mercy, but feared His
	displeasure in whatever he said and did. Thus, this verse points to
	two of the believer's important and basic characteristics: first,
	that he fears God although he cannot see and perceive Him; second,
	that he does not persist in sin in spite of his full awareness of
	God's quality of mercy. These very two characteristics make him
	worthy of honor in the sight of Allah. Besides, there is another
	subtle point also in it, which Imam Razi has pointed out. In Arabic,
	there are two words for fear, khauf and khashiyyat, which have a
	difference in their shade of meaning. The word khauf is generally
	used for the fear that a man feels in his heart on account of his
	sense of weakness as against someone's superior power and strength,
	and the word khashiyyat is used for the dread and awe with which a
	man is filled and inspired because of somebody's glory and grandeur
	and greatness. Here, the word khashiyyat has been used instead of
	khauf, which is meant to point out that a believer does not fear
	Allah only on account of the fear of His punishment, but it is the
	sense of Allah's glory and greatness that keeps him awe inspired at

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote51sym" HREF="#sdfootnote51anc">51</A>This
	is the means by which man gets the power and energy to continue his
	struggle to raise the Word of the Truth and to call the people
	towards righteousness throughout life with full determination even
	though he may have to pass through heart-breaking and
	soul-destroying conditions and his efforts may seem to be bearing no
	fruit. Praising and glorifying the Lord implies the Prayer here, and
	wherever in the Qur'an the praise and glorification has been
	associated with specific times, it implies the Prayer. The Prayer
	&quot;before sunrise&quot; is the Fajr Prayer, and the Prayers
	&quot;before sunset&quot; are the 'Asr and the Zuhr Prayers. The
	Prayers in the night are the Maghrib and the `Isha` Prayers, and the
	third, the Tahajjud Prayer, is also included in the glorification of
	the night. (For explanation, see E.N. 111 of Ta Ha; E.N.'s 23, 24 of
	Ar-Rum). As for the glorification that has been commanded after
	&quot;being free from prostrations&quot;, it may imply the
	after-Prayer devotions as well as the offering of the voluntary
	prayers at the end of the prescribed obligatory Prayers. Hadrat
	Umar, Hadrat 'Ali, Hadrat Hasan bin 'Ali, hadrat Abu Hurairah, Ibn
	`Abbas, Sha`bi, Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, Hasan Basri, Qatadah, Ibrahim
	Nakha`i and Auza'i say that it implies the two rak ats after the
	Maghrib Prayer. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr bin 'As, and according to
	a tradition, Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Abbas also, held the opinion that
	it implies the after-Prayer devotions, and Ibn Zaid says -that the
	object of this Command is that voluntary Prayers also should be
	offered after the prescribed obligatory Prayers. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to a tradition reported in Bukhari and Muslim, on the authority of
	Hadrat Abu Hurairah, once the poor emigrants from Makkah came before
	the Ho]y Prophet, and said &quot;O Messenger of Allah, the rich
	people have attained high ranks for themselves The Holy Prophet
	asked: What has happened ? They said: They offer the Prayers as we
	offer, and they observe the Fasts as we observe; but they practice
	charity, which we cannot, and they set the slaves free which we
	cannot. The Holy Prophet said: Should I tell you a thing which if
	you practiced, you would surpass all others, except those who
	practiced the same that you practiced? It is this that you should
	pronounce Subhan-Allah, al-Hamdu-lillah and Allah-u-Akbar, 33 times
	each after every Prayer. &quot; After some time, the same people
	came and said: `Our rich brothers also have heard this and they too
	have started practicing, it.&quot; Thereupon the Holy Prophet said:
	&quot;This is Allah's bounty and He bestows it on whomever He
	wills.&quot; According to a tradition these devotional words have to
	be repeated ten times each instead of 33 times each. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Zaid bin Thabit has reported that the Holy Prophet instructed his
	Companions that they should pronounce Subhan-Allah and al
	Hamdu-lillah 33 times each and Allah-u-Akbar 34 times after every
	Prayer. Afterwards an Ansar Companion submitted: &quot;I have seen
	in a vision that somebody was telling me that it would be better if
	I pronounced these three devotional words 25 times each and then La
	ilaha ill-Allah 25 times. The Holy Prophet replied: Well, you may do
	likewise.&quot; (Ahmad, Nasa'i, Darimi). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Abu Said Khudri says: &brvbar;I have heard the Holy Prophet
	pronounce the following words when he would return after the Praye
	rs were over: Subhana Rabbika Rabbil- `izzat-i `anima yasifun ' wa
	salam-un 'alal-mursalin, wal-hamdu lillah-i Rabb-il alamin. &quot;
	(Jassas Ahkam al-Qur 'an). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides
	these, several other forms of the after-Prayer devotional
	pronouncements also have been reported from the Holy Prophet. Those
	who wish to act on this instruction of the Qur'an may select the one
	they find suitable from Mishkat.' Bab adh-dhikr 6a `d as-Salat,
	commit it to memory and practice it. Nothing can be better than what
	the Holy Prophet himself has taught in this regard. But what one
	should bear in mind is that the real object of the devotional
	pronouncements is not to utter these words only as a matter of
	course but to refresh and fix their meaning in the mind. Therefore,
	the meaning of whatever devotions one pronounces should be
	understood well and then practiced with full consciousness of the
	meaning.

	difficult for Us to know as to where the dust of one particular
