56 to 60 clearly show that this Surah was sent down a little before
the migration to Habash, and this is supported by the internal
evidence of the subject matter as well. Some commentators have opined
that since it mentions the hypocrites, and hypocrisy appeared in
Madinah, the first ten verses of this Surah were revealed at Madinah
and the rest of it at Makkah; whereas the people whose hypocrisy has
been mentioned here are those who had adopted a hypocritical way of
life because they were afraid of the oppression and extreme physical
torture to which the Muslims were being subjected by the
disbelievers. Evidently, this kind of hypocrisy could be there only
at Makkah and not at Madinah. Similarly, some other commentators,
seeing that in this Surah the Muslims have been exhorted to migrate,
have regarded it as the last Surah to be revealed at Makkah, whereas
the Muslims had migrated to Habash even before their migration to
Madinah. These opinions are not based on any tradition but on the
internal evidence of the subject matter, and this internal evidence,
when considered against the subject matter of the Surah as a whole,
points to the conditions prevailing in the time of the migration to
Habash and not to the last stage at Makkah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A
perusal of the Surah shows that the period of its revelation was the
period of extreme persecution of the Muslims at Makkah. The
disbelievers were opposing and fighting Islam tooth and nail and the
new converts were being subjected to the severest oppression. Such
were the conditions when Allah sent down this Surah to strengthen and
encourage the sincere Muslims as well as to put to shame those who
were showing weakness of the faith. Besides, the disbelievers of
Makkah have been threatened and warned not to invite for themselves
the fate that the antagonists of the Truth have been experiencing in
every age. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

this connection, the questions that some young men answered. For
instance, their parents were urging them to abandon Muhammad (may
Allah's peace be upon him), and return to their ancestral religion,
for they argued: &quot;The Qur'an in which you have put your faith,
regards the rights of the parents as the uppermost; therefore, listen
to what we say; otherwise you will be working against the dictates of
your own Faith.&quot; This has been answered in verse 8. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Similarly,
the people of some clans said to the new converts to Islam, &quot;Leave
the question of punishments, etc., to us. Listen to us and abandon
this man. If God seizes you in the Hereafter, we will come forward
and say, 'Lord, these people are innocent: we had forced them to give
up the Faith; therefore, seize us'.&quot; This has been dealt with,
in vv. 12-13. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

stories mentioned in this Surah also impress the same point mostly,
as if to say, &quot;Look at the Prophets of the past: they were made
to suffer great hardships and were treated cruelly for long periods.
Then, at last they were helped by Allah. Therefore, take heart:
Allah's succor will certainly come. But a period of trial and
tribulation has to be undergone.&quot; Besides teaching this lesson
to the Muslims, the disbelievers also have been warned, as if to say,
&quot;If you are not being immediately seized by Allah, you should
not form the wrong impression that you will never be seized. The
signs of the doomed nations of the past are before you. Just see how
they met their doom and how Allah succored the Prophets.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>When
	this thing was said, the conditions prevailing in Makkah were
	extremely trying. Whoever accepted Islam was made a target of
	tyranny and humiliation and persecution. If he was a slave or a poor
	person, he was beaten and subjected to unbearable tortures; if he
	was a shopkeeper or artisan, he was made to suffer economic
	hardships, even starvation; if he was a member of an influential
	family, his own people would tease and harass him in different ways
	and make life difficult for him. This had created an atmosphere of
	fear and fright in Makkah, due to . which most people were afraid of
	believing in the Holy Prophet although they acknowledged him to be a
	true Prophet in their hearts; and some others who believed would
	lose heart soon afterwards and would submit and yield to the
	disbelievers when they confronted dreadful persecutions. Though
	these trying circumstances could not shake the determination of the
	strong-willed Companions, naturally they also were sometimes
	overwhelmed by an intense feeling of anxiety and distraction. An
	instance of this is found in the tradition of Hadrat Khabbab bin
	Arat, which has been related by Bukhari, Abu Da'ud and Nasa'i. He
	says, &quot;During the time when we had become sick of our
	persecution by the mushriks, one day I saw the Holy Prophet sitting
	in the shade of the wall of the Ka`bah. I wen up to him and said, `O
	Messenger of Allah, don't you pray for us !' Hearing this his face
	became red with feeling and emotion, and he said, `The believers who
	have gone before you had been subjected to even greater
	persecutions. Some one of them was made to sit in a ditch in the
	earth and was sawed into two pieces from head to foot. Someone's
	joints were rubbed with iron combs so as to withhold him from the
	Faith. By God, this Mission will be accomplished and the time is not
	far when a person will travel without apprehension from San`a' to
	Hadramaut and there will be none but Allah Whom he will fear.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In order
	to change this state of agitation into forbearance, Allah tells the
	believers, &quot;Ho one can become worthy of Our promises of success
	in the world and the Hereafter merely by verbal profession of the
	Faith, but every claimant to the Faith will have to pass through
	trials and tribulations so as to furnish proof of The truth of his
	claim. Our Paradise is not so cheap, nor Our special favors in the
	world so low-priced, that We should bless you with all these as soon
	as you proclaim verbal faith in Us. The vial is a pre-requisite for
	them. You will have to undergo hardships for Our sake, suffer losses
	of life and property, face dangers, misfortunes and difficulties;
	you will be tried both with fear and with greed; you will have to
	sacrifice everything that you hold dear for Our pleasure, and bear
	every discomfort in Our way. Then only will it become manifest
	whether your claim to faith in Us was true or false. This thing has
	been said at every such place in the Qur'an where the Muslims have
	been found placed in hardships and difficulties and obsessed by fear
	and consternation. In the initial stage of life at Madinah, after
	the migration, when the Muslims were in great trouble on account of
	economic hardships, external dangers and internal villainy of the
	Jews and the hypocrites, Allah said: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Do
	you think that you will enter Paradise without undergoing such
	trials as were experienced by the believers before you? They met
	with adversity and affliction and were so shaken by trials that the
	Prophet of the time and his followers cried out, `when will Allah's
	help come?' (Then only they were comforted with the good tidings:)
	&quot;Yes, Allah's help is near!&quot;' (Al-Baqarah: 214). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Likewise,
	when after the Battle of Uhud, the Muslims again confronted a period
	of afflictions, it was said: &quot;Do you think that you will enter
	Paradise without undergoing any trial? whereas Allah has not yet
	tried you to see who among you are ready to lay down their lives in
	His way and who will show fortitude for His sake.&quot;
	(Al-i-`Imran: 142). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Almost
	the same thing has been said in Al-i-'Imran: 179, Taubah: 16 and
	Surah Muhammad: 31. Allah in these verses has impressed on the
	Muslims that trial is the touchstone by which the pure and the
	impure are judged. The impure is turned aside by Allah and the pure
	is selected so that Allah may honor them with His favors which the
	sincere believers only deserve.&nbsp;

	experiencing. The same has been happening before also. Whoever made
	a claim to the Faith was made to pass through trials and

	the trial, you are in no way any special people that you should be
	favored and rewarded merely on verbal profession of the Faith.&quot;&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>Literally,
	&quot;It is necessary that Allah should find out.&quot; A question
	may be asked: &quot;When Allah already knows the truth of the
	truthful and the untruth of the liar, why should He put the people
	to the test for the sake of these?&quot; The answer is: Until a
	person has manifested his potential and capability to do a thing in
	practical terms, justice requires that he neither deserves any
	rewards nor any punishment. One man, for example, is capable of
	being trustworthy and another man of being un-trustworthy. Unless
	both are tried and one manifests trustworthiness and the other the
	lack of it practically, it will not be justice on the part of Allah
	that He should reward one for trustworthiness and punish the other
	for the lack of it only on the basis of His knowledge of the unseen.
	Therefore the knowledge Allah already possesses about the
	capabilities of the people and about their conduct in the future is
	not enough to satisfy the requirements of justice until the people
	have manifested their potentialities in practical ways. Justice with
	Allah is not based on the knowledge that a person possesses a
	tendency to steal and will commit a theft, but on the knowledge that
	he has actually committed a theft. Likewise, Allah does not bestow
	favors and rewards on the basis of the knowledge that a person has
	the potential and capability to become a great believer and fighter
	in His way, but on the basis of the knowledge that the person
	concerned has practically proved by deed and action that he is a
	sincere believer and a brave fighter in His way. That is why we have
	translated the words of the verse as: &quot;Allah has to see...&quot;&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote11">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote11sym" HREF="#sdfootnote11anc">11</A>According
	to Muslim, Tirmidhi, Ahmad, Abu Da'ud and Nasa`i, this verse was
	Sent down in respect of Hadrat Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas. He was 18 or 19
	years old when he embraced Islam. When his mother, Hamnah, daughter
	of Sufyan bin Umayyah (neice of Abu Sufyan), came to know that her
	son had become a Muslim, she said, &quot;I will neither eat nor
	drink nor sit in shade unless you disown Muhammad. The rights of the
	mother are supermost even according to Allah's Command. Therefore if
	you disobey me, you will be disobeying Allah too.&quot; Hadrat Sa'd
	was perplexed and came before the Holy Prophet and told his whole
	story. At this, this verse was revealed. Possibly other young men
	who embraced Islam in the initial stage at Makkah were also
	confronted with similar situations. Therefore, the same theme has
	been repeated forcefully in Surah Luqman: 15 also. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">What the
	verse means to impress is this: The rights of the parents, among the
	creation of Allah, are to be held as the supreme, but even if the
	parents force a person to adopt shirk, they should not be obeyed.
	The words, &quot;If both of them force you to associate...&quot;
	imply that a lesser pressure, or a pressure by either of them,
	deserves to be set aside much more promptly. The next sentence,
	&quot;.... whom you do not know (as such),&quot; is also noteworthy.
	This gives a sound reason for not obeying the parents in this
	regard. The parents certainly have the right that the children
	should serve them, respect them, and obey them in lawful things. But
	they do not have the right that one should obey them blindly against
	one's knowledge of the reality. Therefore, there is no reason why a
	person should go on following his parents' religion just because it
	is their religion. If the children come to know that their parents
	are following a false religion, they should give it up and adopt the
	right religion. and should not follow the wrong way whose falsehood
	has become clear to them even if the parents use every kind of
	pressure for it. When this is so in the case of even the parents, it
	should be so with every other person, too. No one deserves to be
	followed and obeyed unless one is sure that the person being
	followed is on the right path. &nbsp;

	. If the children have accepted deviation for the sake of the

	should understand that in case of an unbearable persecution and loss
	and extreme fear, one is permitted to disown Islam and save one's

	disowns Islam under compulsion in order to save his life and the
	time-server who ideologically believes in Islam as a true religion
	but joins the disbelievers when he sees the dangers and risks
	involved in the life of Faith. Apparently, they do not seem to be
	much different from each other, but the thing which sets them poles
	apart is this: The sincere Muslim who utters disbelief under
	compulsion not only remains attached to Islam ideologically, but
	practically also his sympathies remain with Islam and the Muslims;
	he feels happy over their successes and unhappy at their defeat.
	Even under compulsion he tries to avail himself of every opportunity
	to cooperate with the Muslims, and remains on the look-out for a
	chance to join his brethren-in-faith as soon as the grip of the
	enemies loosens a little. Contrary to this, when the time-server
	finds that the way of the Faith is difficult to follow and
	calculates carefully that the disadvantages of siding with Islam
	outweigh the advantages of re joining the disbelievers, he turns
	away from Islam and the Muslims for the sake of personal safety and
	worldly gains, establishes friendship with the disbelievers and is
	prepared to carry out for his own interests any service for them,
	which may be utterly opposed to the Faith and harmful to the
	Muslims. But at the same time, he does not close his eyes to the
	possibility that Islam also might prosper some time in the future.
	Therefore, whenever he gets an opportunity to talk to the Muslims,
	he acknowledges their ideology and admits his faith and pays homage
	to their sacrifices most generously, so that his verbal admissions
	might be helpful as and when required. At another place in the
	Qur'an this same bargaining mentality of the hypocrites has been
	described, thus: &quot;The hypocrites are watching you closely to
	see (how the wind blows). If victory comes to you from Allah, they
	will say to you, `Were we not with you?' And if the disbelievers
	gain the upper hand, they will say to them, `Were we not strong
	enough to fight against you'? Yet we defended you from the
	Muslims'.&quot; (An-Nisa': 141). &nbsp;

	any law of justice to let him off and punish instead of him the
	first thief who had prompted him to commit the theft. However, the
	first thief will suffer punishment for two offenses: the offense of
	committing theft himself and the offense of turning another person
	into a thief along with himself. This principle has been stated at

	these few sentences the Prophet Abraham has put together all
	rational arguments against idol-worship. There must necessarily be
	some reason for making somebody or something a deity. One such
	reason can be that somebody should be entitled to being a deity due
	to some personal excellence. Another, that he should be the creator
	of man, and man should be indebted to him for tiffs existence.
	Third, that he should be responsible for man's sustenance, his food
	and other means of life. Fourth, that man's future should be linked
	up with his support and bounty, and man may be afraid that annoying
	him would mean bringing about his own ruin. The Prophet Abraham said
	that none of these four things favored idol-worship, but they all
	favored and demanded pure God-worship. Saying that they are mere
	idols, he demolished the first argument, for a mere idol could have
	no excellence to entitle it to be a deity. Then, by saying that &quot;You
	are their creator&quot;, be refuted the second argument, and &quot;they
	have no power to give you any sustenance&quot; destroyed the third
	reason. Lastly. he said, &quot;You have to return to Allah
	ultimately&quot; and not to the idols; therefore, it was not in
	their power to make or mar your destiny, but in the power of God
	alone. Thus, after a complete refutation of shirk, the Prophet
	Abraham made it clear to them that all the reasons for which man
	could regard somebody as a deity only applied to Allah, Who alone
	should be worshiped without associating anyone else with him.&nbsp;

	context shows that when the Prophet Abraham came out of the fire and
	spoke the preceding sentences, only Prophet Lot from the entire
	crowd came forward to proclaim his belief and adopt his obedience.
	It is just possible that many other people also on this occasion
	might have been convinced of the Prophet Abraham's being a true
	Prophet, but in view of the violent reaction that had been shown
	openly by the entire community and the government against Abraham's
	Faith, no one else could muster up courage to affirm faith in such a

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, the

	the Prophet Abraham's emerging safe and sound from the fire? If it
	is so, can a person who has been a mushrikr be appointed to
	Prophethood? The answer is this: Here the Qur'an has used the words
	fa-amana la-hu Lut, which do not necessarily imply that the Prophet
	Lot disbelieved in God before this, or associated other deities with
	Him. They only show that after this he confirmed the Prophethood of
	the Prophet Abraham, and adopted his obedience. Possibly the Prophet
	Lot was a young boy then and this might be the first very occasion
	when he became acquainted with the teachings of his uncle and his

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote77sym" HREF="#sdfootnote77anc">77</A>The
	address apparently is directed to the Holy Prophet but, in fact, it
	is meant for all the believers. Until now they were being counselled
	patience and reliance on Allah to brave the extreme trying
	conditions in which they found themselves and the persecutions they
	were being subjected to on account of their faith. Now they are
	being told to recite the Qur'an and establish the Salat as a
	practical device, for these are the two things which endow a
	believer with a strong character and a wonderful capacity by which
	he can not only brave successfully the most violent storms of evil
	and falsehood but can even subdue them. But man can acquire this
	power from the recitation of the Qur'an and the Prayer only when he
	does not retrain content with the mere recital of the words but also
	understands well the Qur'anic teachings and absorbs them in his
	soul, and his Prayer does not remain confined to physical movements
	but becomes the very function of his heart and the motive force for
	his morals and character. The desired quality of the Prayer is being
	mentioned by the Qur'an itself in the next sentence. As for its
	recitation, one should know that the recitation which does not reach
	the heart beyond the throat, cannot even give man enough power to
	remain steadfast to his faith, not to speak of enabling him to
	withstand the furies of unbelief. About such people, a Hadith says:
	&quot;They will recite the Qur'an, but the Qur'an will not go beyond
	their throats; they will leave the Faith just as the arrow leaves
	the bow.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim, Mu'atta`). As a matter of fact, the
	recitation which does not effect any change in a man's way of
	thinking, and his morals and character, and he goes on doing what
	the Qur'an forbids, is not the recitation of a believer at all.
	About such a one the Holy Prophet has said: ;'He who makes lawful
	what the Qur'an has declared unlawful, has not believed in the
	Qur'an at all.&quot; (Tirmidhi, on the authority of Suhaib Rumi).
	Such a recitation does not reform and strengthen a maws self and
	spirit, but makes him even more stubborn against Allah and impudent
	before his own conscience, and destroys his character altogether.
	For the case of the person who believes in the Qur'an as a Divine
	Book, reads it and comes to know what his God has enjoined, and then
	goes on violating His injunctions, is of the culprit, who commits a
	crime not due to ignorance but after full knowledge of the law. The
	Holy Prophet has elucidated this point in a brief sentence, thus:
	&quot;The Qur'an is a testimony in your favor as well as against
	you.&quot; (Muslim). That is, &quot;If you follow the Qur'an rightly
	it is a testimony in your favor. Whenever you are called to account
	for your deeds, here or in the hereafter, you can produce the Qur'an
	as a testimony in your defense, saying that whatever you did was in
	accordance with this Book. If what you did was precisely according
	to it, no jurist in the world will be able to punish you, nor will
	God in the Hereafter hold you accountable for it. But if this Book
	has reached you, and you have read it and found out what your Lord
	demands from you, what He enjoins and what He forbids, and then you
	adopt an attitude opposed to it, then this Book will be a testimony
	against you. It will further strengthen the criminal case against
	you in the Court of God. Then it will in no way be possible for you
	to escape the punishment, or receive a light punishment, by making
	the excuse of ignorance.&quot;</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote78">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote78sym" HREF="#sdfootnote78anc">78</A>This
	is an important characteristic out of the many characteristics of
	the Prayer, which has been presented here prominently in view of its
	relevance to the context. To counter the severe storm of opposition
	and resistance that the Muslims were experiencing in Makkah, they
	stood in need of a moral force rather than any material power. To
	bring about the moral force and develop it suitably two practical
	devices were pointed out in the first instance, the recitation of
	the Qur'an and the establishment of the Salat. Now they are being
	told that the establishment of the Salat is the means through which
	they can get rid of those evils in which they themselves had been
	involved before they embraced Islam and in which the non-Muslim
	Arabs and the non-Arab world around them were involved at that time.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">With a
	little thinking one can easily understand why this special advantage
	of the Prayer has been particularly mentioned here. Evidently,
	getting rid of the moral evils is not only useful insofar as it is
	beneficial for those who attain the moral purity, both here and in
	the Hereafter, but its inevitable advantage is that it gives them
	unique superiority over those who might be involved in diverse moral
	evils, and who might be exerting their utmost to sustain the impure
	system of ignorance, which nourishes those evils, against the
	efforts of the morally pure people. Indecent and evil acts are those
	which man by nature abhors, and which have always been held as evil
	in principle by the people of every community and society, however
	depraved and perverted practically. The Arab society in the days of
	the revelation of the Qur'an was no exception to this. Those people
	also were aware of the moral virtues and the evils: they valued the
	good above the evil and there might be none among them, who regarded
	the evil as identical with the good, or depreciated good. Under such
	conditions, in a perverted society like that, the emergence of a
	movement which revolutionized morally members of the same society
	itself as soon as they came into contact with it, and raised them in
	character high above their contemporaries, inevitably had widespread
	effects. The common Arabs could not possibly fail to feel the moral
	impact of the movement, which eradicated evils and promoted
	goodness, and instead go on following those who were themselves
	morally corrupt and were fighting to sustain the system of
	ignorance, which had been nourishing those evils since centuries.
	That is why the Qur'an at that time exhorted the Muslims to
	establish Salat instead of urging them to collect material resources
	and force and strength that could win over the people's hearts and
	defeat the enemy without any material force. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	virtue of the Prayer that has been mentioned here has two aspects:
	its essential and inseparable quality that it restrains from evil
	and indecent acts, and its desired quality that the one who performs
	it should in actual fact refrain from evil and indecent acts. As for
	the first quality the Prayer does restrain people from the evils.
	Anyone who ponders a little over the nature of the Prayer, will
	admit that of all the checks and brakes that can be put on man to
	restrain him from the evils, the Prayer can be the most effective.
	After all, what check could be more effective than this that man
	should be called upon five times a day for the remembrance of Allah
	and made to remind himself again and again that he is not wholly
	free and independent in this world but is the servant of One God,
	and his God is He Who is aware of his open as well as hidden acts,
	even of the most secret aims and intentions of his heart, and a time
	will surely come when he will have to account for all his deeds
	before his God. Then he is not only reminded of this but is given
	practical training at every Prayer time that he should not disobey
	any of his God's Commands even secretly. From the time that he
	stands up for the Prayer till its completion man has to perform
	continuously certain acts in which there is no third person, besides
	him and his God, who can know whether he has obeyed God's law or ,
	disobeyed it. For instance, if the man's wudu (state of ablutions )
	has become void and he stands up for the Prayer, there ca.. be no
	one, besides him and God, who will know that he is no longer in the
	state of wudu. If the man has expressed no intention of the Prayer
	but just goes on performing all the required movements and recites
	poetry, for instance, instead of the prescribed texts quietly, there
	is none, besides him and his God who can be aware of the secret that
	he has not, in fact, performed his Prayer at all. Not with standing
	this, if a person offers the Prayer five times a day, fulfilling
	faithfully all the conditions of the Divine law in respect of the
	cleanliness of the body and dress, and the essentials of the Prayer
	and its recitation, etc. it means that through this Prayer his
	conscience is being awakened to life several times a day, he is
	being helped to-become a responsible and dutiful person, and he is
	being practically trained that he should, under his own urge of
	obedience, abide by the law which he has believed in openly as well
	as secretly, regardless whether there is any external force to make
	him abide by it or not, and whether the people of the world have any
	knowledge of his intentions and deeds or not. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus
	considered, one cannot help admitting that the Prayer not only
	restrains man from the evils and indecencies, but, in fact, there is
	no other method of training in the world, which may be so effective
	as the Prayer is in restraining man from the evils. As for the
	question whether or not man in actual fact refrains from the evils
	even after attendance at the Prayer, this depends upon the man
	himself, who is undergoing training for self-reform. If he has the
	intention to benefit from it, and endeavors for it, the reformatory
	effects of the Prayer will certainly have their impact on him.
	Otherwise, evidently, no reformatory device in the world can be
	effective with a person, who is not prepared to receive any impact
	of it, or tries to avoid its impact intentionally. This can be
	explained by an example. The essential quality of food is to nourish
	the body and develop it. But this advantage can be had only when
	food is allowed to be assimilated. If a person vomits what he eats
	after every meal, his food cannot profit him in any way. Just as,
	keeping such a person in view, one cannot say that food is not
	nutritious for the body, because so-and-so is becoming a skeleton in
	spite of eating food, so can no one present the example of an
	unrighteous offerer of the Prayer and say that the Prayer does not
	restrain from the evils, because so-and-so is unrighteous in spite
	of his Prayer. Just as about such a person it will be apt to say
	that he does not offer the Prayer at all, so about the person who
	vomits everything he eats, it will be apt to say that he does not
	eat his food at all. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Precisely
	the same thing has been reported from the Holy Prophet and some
	great Companions and their followers. `Imran bin Husain reports that
	the Holy Prophet said: &quot;He Whose Prayer did not restrain him
	from the evil and indecent acts, offered no Prayer at all.&quot;
	(Ibn Abi Hatim). -Ibn `Abbas has reported the Holy Prophet as
	saying: &quot;The Prayer which did not restrain a person from the
	evil and indecent acts, led him further away from Allah.&quot; (Ibn
	Abi Hatim, Tabarani). A Hadith containing the same theme has been
	reported by Hasan Basri directly from the Holy Prophet (Ibn Jarir,
	Baihaqi). Another Hadith reported on the authority of Ibn Mas`ud is
	to the effect: &quot;He who did not obey the Prayer, offered no
	Prayer at all, and obedience to the Prayer is that one should
	refrain from the evil and indecent acts.&quot; (Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi
	Hatim). Several sayings to the same effect have been reported on the
	authority of 'Abdullah bin Mas`ud, `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Hasan
	Basri, Qatadah and A`amash, etc. Imam Ja`far Sadiq has said: &quot;He
	who wants to know whether his Prayer has been accepted or not,
	should see how far his Prayer has restrained him from the evil and
	indecent acts. If he has been restrained from the evils, his Prayer
	has been accepted.&quot; (Ruh al Ma `ani). &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote79sym" HREF="#sdfootnote79anc">79</A>This
	can have several meanings: (1) &quot;That the remembrance of Allah
	(i.e. Prayer) is a thing of much higher value: it not only restrains
	from the evils, but, over and above that, it induces people to act
	righteously and urges them to excel one another in good acts,&quot;
	(2) &quot;that Allah's remembrance in itself is a great thing: it is
	the best of acts: no act of man is greater in value than this. ` (3)
	&quot;that Allah's remembrance of you is a greater thing than your
	remembrance of Him. Allah has said in the Qur'an: &quot;So remember
	Me: I will remember you'.&quot; (Al-Baqarah: 156). Thus, when the
	servant remembers Allah in the Prayer, inevitably Allah also will
	remember him, and the merit of Allah's remembering the servant is
	certainly greater than the servant's remembering Allah. Besides
	these three meanings, there is another subtle meaning also, which
	the wife of Hadrat Abud Darda has explained. She says, &quot;Allah's
	remembrance is not restricted to the Prayer, but, its sphere is much
	vaster. When a man observes a fast, or pays the Zakat or performs a
	righteous act, he inevitably remembers Allah. That is why the
	righteous act emanates from him. Likewise, when a man refrains from
	an evil act when an opportunity exists for it, even this also is the
	result of Allah's remembrance. Thus, the remembrance of Allah
	pervades the entire life of a believer.&quot;

	is, &quot;The discussion should be conducted rationally, in a

	method of discussion, which the inviters to the Truth should adopt.
	The method is this: &quot;Do not make the error or deviation of the

	begin the discussion with those points of truth and justice which
	are common between you and your opponent. That is, the discussion

	whereas his stand is contradictory to them 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, one should bear in mind the fact that the people of the
	Book did not deny Revelation, Prophethood and Tauhid, like the
	polytheists of Arabia, but believed in these realities just like the
	Muslims. After agreement on these basic things, the main thing that
	could become the basis of difference Between them could be that the
	Muslim would not believe in the Divine Scriptures sent down to them
	and would invite them to believe in the Divine Book sent down to
	themselves, and would declare them disbelievers if they did not
	believe in it. This would have been a strong basis of their
	conflict. But the Muslims had a different stand. They believed as
	true all those Books that were with the people of the Book, and then
	also had believed in the Revelation that had been sent down to the
	Holy Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him). After this it was
	for the people of the Book to tell the rational ground for which
	they believed in one Book sent by Allah and rejected the other. That
	is why Allah here has instructed the Muslims that whenever they have
	to deal with the people of the Book, they should first of all
	present before them this very point of view in a positive manner.
	Say to them: &quot;We believe in the same God in Whom you believe
	and we are obedient to Him. We have submitted ourselves to all those
	Commands and injunctions and teachings that have come from Him,

	servants of God and not of a country or a community or a race, that
	we should submit to God's Command when it is sent down in one place
	and reject it when it is sent down in another place. This thing has
	been repeated at several places in the Qur'an and particularly in
	relation to the people of the Book, it has been presented

<DIV ID="sdfootnote91">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote91sym" HREF="#sdfootnote91anc">91</A>That
	is, &quot;A Book like the Qur'an has been sent down to you in spite
	of your being unlettered. Is it not by itself a great miracle which
	should convince the people of your Prophethood? Do they yet need
	another miracle after this? The other miracles were the miracles for
	those who witnessed them. But this miracle is ever present in front
	of them. It is being recited before them almost daily; they can
	witness it as and when they like. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Even
	after such an assertion and argument by the Qur'an the audacity of
	those who try to prove that the Holy Prophet was literate is
	astonishing. The fact, however, is that the Qur'an here has
	presented in clear terms the Holy Prophet's being illiterate as a
	strong proof of his Prophet hood. The traditions which lend support
	to the claim that the Holy Prophet could read and write, or had
	learnt reading and writing later in life, stand rejected at first
	glance, for no tradition opposed to the Qur'an can be acceptable.
	Then these traditions in themselves are too weak to become the basis
	for an argument. One of these is a tradition from Bukhari that when
	the peace treaty of Hudaibiya was being written down, the
	representative of the disbelievers of Makkah objected to the word
	Rasul Allah being added to the name of the Holy Prophet. At this the
	Holy Prophet ordered the writer (Hadrat `Ali) to cross out the word
	Rasul-Allah and write Muhammad bin 'Abdullah instead. Hadrat `Ali
	refused to cross out Rasul-Allah. Then the Holy Prophet took it in
	his own hand, struck out the word himself and wrote Muhammad bin
	`Abdullah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But this
	tradition from Bara' bin `Azib appears at four places in Bukhari and
	at two places in Muslim and everywhere in different words: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)At one
	place in Bukhari (Kitab-us-S, ulh) the words of this tradition are
	to the effect: &quot;The Holy Prophet told Hadrat `Ali to strike out
	the words. He submitted that he could not do that. At last, the Holy
	Prophet crossed them out with his own hand.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) In
	the same book the second tradition is to the effect: &quot;Then he
	(the Holy Prophet) said to `Ali: Cross out Rasul-Allah. He said: By
	God, I shall never cross out your name. At last, the Holy Prophet
	took the document and wrote: This is the treaty concluded by
	Muhammad bin `Abdullah.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	third tradition, again from Bara' bin `Azib is found in
	Kitab-ul-Jizia in Bukhari to the effect: &quot;The Holy Prophet
	himself could not write. He said to `Ali: Cross out Rasul-Allah. He
	submitted: By God, I shall never cross out these words. At this, the
	Holy Prophet said: Show me the place where these words are written.
	He showed him the place, and the Holy Prophet crossed out the words
	with his own hand.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	fourth tradition is in Bukhari's Kitab-ul-Maghazi to the effect: &quot;So
	the Holy Prophet took the document although he did not know writing,
	and he wrote: This is the treaty concluded by Muhammad bin
	`Abdullah.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) Again
	from Bara' bin `Azib there is a tradition in Muslim (Kitab-ul-Jihad)
	saying that on Hadrat `Alt's refusal the Holy Prophet himself wiped
	off the words Rasul-Allah. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) The
	second tradition from him in the same book says, &quot;The Holy
	Prophet said to `Ali: Show me where the word Rasul Allah is written.
	Hadrat `Ali showed him the place, and he wiped it off and wrote Ibn
	`Abdullah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	disparity in the traditions clearly indicates that the intermediary
	reporters have not reported the words of Hadrat Bara' bin `Azib (may
	Allah be pleased with him) accurately. Therefore, none of these
	reports can be held as perfectly reliable so that it could be said
	with certainty that the Holy Prophet had written the words &quot;Muhammad
	bin `Abdullah with his own hand. Probably when Hadrat 'Ali, refused
	to wipe off the word Rasul-Allah, the Holy Prophet might have
	himself wiped it off after finding, out the place where it was
	written, and then might have got the word Ibn `Abdullah substituted
	by him or by some other writer. Other traditions show that there
	were two writers who were writing down the peace treaty; Hadrat `Ali
	and Muhammad bin Maslamah (Fath al-Sari, Vol. V, p. 217). Therefore,
	it is not impossible that what one writer did not do was got done by
	the other writer. However, if the Holy Prophet actually wrote his
	name with his own hand, there are plenty instances of this in the
	world. The illiterate people learn to write their own name although
	they cannot read or write anything else. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	tradition on whose basis it has been claimed that the Holy Prophet
	was literate, has been reported by Ibn Abi Shaibah and `Umar bin
	Shabbah from Mujahid. It says: &quot;The Holy Prophet had learned
	reading and writing before his death.&quot; But in the first place,
	it is a weak tradition on account of its links as said by Hafiz Ibn
	Kathir: &quot;It is weak: it has no basis.&quot; Secondly, it is
	weak otherwise also, for if the Holy Prophet had really learned
	reading and writing later in life, it would have become a well known
	fact. Many of the Companions would have reported it, and it would
	also have been known from which person (or persons) he had learned
	this. But no one except one man, 'Aun bin 'Abdullah, from whom
	Mujahid heard this, has reported it. And this 'Aun was not even a
	Companion, but a follower of the Companions, who does not at all
	tell from which Companion (or Companions) he got this information.
	Evidently, on the basis of such weak traditions nothing which
	contradicts well known facts can become acceptable.

	is an allusion to the Hijrah, which implies this: if you feel that

	God, for God's earth is vast. You should serve Allah and not your

	some time the demands of the nation and country's love clash with
	the demands of Allah's worship, it is the time of trial for the

	nation and the country and home. The false claimant to the Faith
	will abandon the Faith and remain clinging to his nation and his

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Precisely

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;No
	man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love
	the other; or else he will hold :o the one, and despise the other.
	Ye cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Take no
	thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink;
	nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more
	than treat, and the body than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air:
	for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet
	your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
	Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
	And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the
	field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: And yet I
	say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like
	one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field,
	which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not
	much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Therefore take no
	thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall .we drink? or,
	Wherewithal shall we be clothed? (For after all these things do the
	Gentiles seek ) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need
	of all these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
	righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. Take
	therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take
	thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the
	evil thereof.&quot; (Matthew. 6: 2434).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	background of these discourses of the Qur'an and the Gospel is the
	same. There always comes a stage in the way of the propagation of
	the Truth when the follower of the Truth is left with no alternative
	but to stake his very life only with trust in Allah, regardless of
	the support and means of the material world. In these conditions,
	those who are too calculating about the possibilities of the future
	and seeking guarantees of the safety of life and assurance of
	provisions cannot do anything. Indeed, such conditions are changed
	only by the efforts and power of those who rise fearlessly in face
	of every danger and are even prepared to risk their very lives. It
	is all due to their sacrifices that ultimately the Word of Allah is
	raised high and all other words and creeds stand humbled and subdued
