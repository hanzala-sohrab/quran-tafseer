As it contains a detailed and comprehensive review of the Battle, it
appears that most probably it was revealed at one and the same time.
But it is also possible that some of the verses concerning the
problems arising as a result of this Battle might have been revealed
later and incorporated at the proper places to make it a continuous
whole. At any rate, in the whole Surah there is nothing that might
show that it is a collection of a couple of discourses, that have
been patched up together. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>During
the first decade or so of the Prophethood at Makkah, the Message had
proved its firmness, and stability. This was the result of two
things. First, the Messenger, who possessed the highest qualities of
character, was performing his Mission with wisdom, foresight and
magnanimity. He had shown by his conduct that he had made up his mind
to carry the movement to a successful end and, therefore, was ready
to face all sorts of dangers and obstacles in the way. Secondly, the
Message was so charming that it attracted the minds and hearts of the
people irresistibly towards itself. So much so that all obstacles of
ignorance, superstition and petty prejudices failed to check, its
advance. That is why the Arab upholders of the ways of &quot;ignorance,'
who looked down upon it in its initial stages, had' begun to reckon
it as a serious menace during the last period of the stay of the Holy
Prophet at Makkah, and were bent on crushing it with all the force at
their command. But in spite of the above-mentioned strength, the
movement still lacked certain things to lead it to victory:- </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First,
it had not yet been fully proved that it had gathered round it a
sufficient number of such followers who not only believed in its
truth, but also had such an intense devotion to its principles that
they were ready to expend all their energies and all that they
possessed in the struggle for its success and establishment. So much
so that they were ready to sacrifice their lives in the fight against
the whole world itself even though they should be their own nearest
relative. It is true that the followers of Islam had endured the
severest persecutions at the hands of the Quraish of Makkah and had
given a good proof of the firmness of their faith and their strong
relation with Islam, yet further trials were required to show that
Islam had succeeded in acquiring such a band of followers which
considered nothing dearer than its ideal and was ready to sacrifice
life for it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Secondly,
though the voice of Islam had reached' every part of the country, its
effects were yet scattered and its acquired strength was spread here
and there: it had not yet gathered sufficient force essential for a
decisive conflict with the old established order of &quot;ignorance&quot;.
</FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thirdly,
Islam had yet no home of its own and had not established itself
firmly anywhere in the land where it could consolidate its power and
make it a base for further action. For the Muslims were scattered all
over the country and were living among the unbelievers as aliens whom
their bloodthirsty enemies wanted to uproot from their own homes. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fourthly,
the Muslims had not yet had an opportunity to demonstrate practically
the blessings of the system of life based on Islam. There was neither
any Islamic culture, nor any social, economic or political system;
nor were there any established principles of war and peace for their
guidance. Therefore the Muslims had no opportunity for demonstrating
those moral principles on which they intended to build their entire
system of life; nor had it been proved on the touchstone of trial
that the Muslims as a community were sincere in their proclamation of
the Message. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Allah
created opportunities for making up these deficiencies. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">During
the last four years or so of the Prophet's stay at Makkah, the voice
of Islam had been proving effective at Yathrab and the people for
various reasons had been accepting the message more readily than
other clans of Arabia. So much so that in the twelfth year of
Prophethood on the occasion of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Haj</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">a deputation of 75 people met the Holy
Prophet in the darkness of night. These people not only accepted
Islam, but also offered to give him and his followers a home. As this
was a most epoch making opportunity provided by Allah, the Holy
Prophet took advantage of it. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
significance of this offer was quite clear to the people of Yathrab,
and they fully realized that this was not an invitation to a mere
fugitive, but to the Messenger of Allah so that he should become
their leader and ruler. Likewise they knew that they were not
inviting the Muslim refugees to give them shelter from persecution
but to assemble them from all over the country for their integration
with themselves to form an organized community. Thus the offer of the
people of Yathrab was to make Yathrab the &quot;City of Islam.&quot;
Accordingly the Holy Prophet accepted their invitation and made it
the first &quot;City of Islam&quot; in Arabia. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">And
the people of Yathrab were fully aware of the implications of this
offer. It was indeed a declaration of war against the whole of
Arabia, and an invitation to their own social and economic boycott as
well. And when the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ansar</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">from Yathrab declared their allegiance
to the Holy Prophet at Aqabah, they knew fully well its consequences.
During the course of the formal declaration of allegiance, Asad-bin-
Zurarah, the youngest of all the delegates from Yathrab, stood up and
said, &quot;0 people of Yathrab! Just listen to me and consider the
matter carefully in all its aspects. Though we have come to him,
regarding him only as a Messenger of Allah, we should know that we
shall be inviting the enmity of the whole of Arabia. For when we take
him away to Yathrab, we shall be attacked and our children may be put
to the sword. Therefore if you have the courage in your hearts to
face it, then and then only, you should declare your allegiance to
him and Allah will give you its reward. But if you love your lives
more than him and his Message, then leave this matter and frankly
excuse yourselves, for at this time Allah may accept your excuses.&quot;
</FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Abbas
bin Ubadah bin Naalah, another member of the delegation, reiterated
the same thing, saying, </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Do
you understand the implication of the declaration of your allegiance
to this person?&quot; (Voices, &quot;Yes, we know it.&quot;) &quot;You
are challenging the whole world to war by your declaration of
allegiance to him. There is every likelihood of a serious menace to
your lives and properties. Therefore consider it well. If you have
any idea lurking in your minds that you will then hand him over to
his enemies, it is much better to leave him alone now, because that
conduct shall bring shame and disgrace to you in this world and the
next. On the other hand, if you have sincerely resolved that you will
endure all kinds of consequences that will follow as a result of this
invitation, then it would be the best thing to take the oath of
allegiance to him because, by God, this will surely bring good to you
in this world as well as in the next world.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At
this all the members of the delegation cried with one voice, &quot;We
are ready and prepared to risk all our wealth and our noble kith and
kin for his sake.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
was then that the famous oath of allegiance, which is known as the
&quot;Second Oath of Allegiance at Aqabah&quot; was taken. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On
the other side, the people of Makkah also understood fully well the
implications of this matter from their own point of view. They
realized that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him), who, they knew
well, had a great personality and possessed extraordinary abilities,
was going to gain a strong footing, by this allegiance. For this
would help integrate his followers, whose constancy, determination,
and unwavering fidelity to the Messenger had been tried, into a
disciplined community under his wise leadership and guidance. And
they knew that this would spell death for their old ways of life.
They also realized the strategic importance of. Al-Madinah to their
trade, which was their chief means of livelihood. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Its
geographical position was such that the Muslims could strike with
advantage at the caravans traveling on the trade route between Yemen
and Syria, and thus strike at the root of their economy and that of
other pagan clans very effectively. The value of the trade done by
the people of Makkah alone on this route, not to count that of raif
and other places, amounted to about two hundred thousand </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">dinars</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
the Quraish were fully aware of the implications of the oath of
allegiance at Aqabah, they were greatly perturbed when they got wind
of it the same night. At first they tried to win over the people of
Al-Madinah to their side. But when they saw that the Muslims were
migrating to Al- Madinah in small groups, they realized that the Holy
Prophet was also going to emigrate soon from there. Then they decided
to adopt an extreme measure to prevent this danger. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A
few days before his migration, the Quraish held a council to consider
the matter. After a good deal of argument; they decided that one
person should be taken from each of the families of Quraish other
than that of Banu Hashim to put an end to the life of the Holy
Prophet. This was to make it difficult for the family of the Holy
Prophet to fight alone with all the other families of the Quraish and
thus to force them to accept blood-money for his murder-instead of
taking revenge from them, but by the grace of Allah their plot
against the life of the Holy Prophet failed because of his admirable
foresight and full trust in Allah, and he reached Al- Madinah safe
and sound. When they could not prevent his emigration, it occurred to
them to exploit Abdullah bin Ub`ai who had begun to cherish a
grievance against the Holy Prophet since his arrival at Al-Madinah.
He was an influential chief of Al-Madinah and the people had agreed
to make him their king. But when the majority of Aus and Khazraj clan
became Muslims and acknowledged the Holy Prophet as their leader,
guide and ruler, all his hopes of becoming a king came to an end.
Therefore the Quraish wrote to him, &quot;As you have given shelter
to our enemy, we tell you plainly that you should either fight with
him yourself or exile him from your city otherwise we swear by God
that we will invade your city, kill your males and make your females
our slave girls.&quot; This letter added fuel to the flames of his
jealousy and he was inclined to do some mischief, but the Holy
Prophet took timely precautions and defeated his evil designs. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
Quraish got another opportunity to hold out a threat. When Sa'ad bin
Mu'az, another chief of Al-Madinah, went to Makkah to perform `</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Umrah</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
Abu Jahl interrupted him at the very door of the Kabah, saying, &quot;Do
you think we will let you perform `</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Umrah</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">in peace while you give shelter and
help to renegades from us? Had you not been a guest of Ummayyah bin
Khalf, you would not have gone alive from here.&quot; Sa'ad replied,
&quot;By Allah, if you prevent me from this, I will retaliate in a
worse manner and block your route near Al-Madinah.&quot; This
incident virtually led to a declaration from the people of Makkah
that they would prevent the Muslims from a pilgrimage to the Kabah,
and from the people of Al- Madinah that as a retaliation they would
block their trade route to Syria against the opponents of Islam. As a
matter of fact there was no other alternative for the Muslims than to
keep a strong hold on this route so as to force the Quraish, and the
other clans, whose interests were vitally bound with this route, to
reconsider their inimical and antagonistic attitude towards them.
That is why the Holy Prophet attached the greatest importance to this
problem. As soon as he was free from making the preliminary
arrangements for organizing the newly formed Muslim Community and
settling peace terms with the neighboring Jewish habitations, he
adopted two measures in this connection:- </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First,
he entered into negotiations with those clans who lived between the
Red Sea and this route so as to make alliances with them or at east
to persuade them to make treaties of neutrality with the Muslims. He
was successful in this, and he entered into a treaty of non-alignment
with Juhainah, which was a very important clan of the hilly tract
near the sea coast. Then, at the end of the first year of Hijrah, he
made a treaty of defensive alliance with Bani Damrah, who lived near
Yanb'u and Zawal Ushairah. In 2 A. H. Bani Mudlij also joined the
alliance, as they were the neighbors and allies of Bani Damrah. Then
ii so happened that quite a large number of these people were
converted to Islam as a result of the missionary work done by the
Muslims. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Secondly,
he successively sent small bands of his men on this route to serve as
a warning to the Quraish, and himself accompanied some of them. In
the first year of Hijrah, four expeditions were sent there, that is,
the expedition under Hamzah, the expedition under Ubaidah bin Harith,
the expedition under Sa'ad bin Abi Waqqas and the Al-Abwa' expedition
under the Holy Prophet himself. In the first month of the second year
two more incursions were made on the same route. These are known as
Buwat Expedition and Zawal Ushairah Expedition. Two things about all
these expeditions are noteworthy. First, no blood was shed and no
caravans were plundered in any of these expeditions. This proves that
the real object of these expeditions was to show to the Quraish which
way the wind was blowing. Secondly, not a single man from the people
of Al-Madinah was sent by the Holy. Prophet on any of these
incursions. All the bands consisted purely of the immigrants from
Makkah so that the conflict should remain between the people of the
Quraish themselves and should not further spread by the involvement
of other clans. On the other side, the Quraish of Makkah tried to
involve others also in the conflict. When they sent bands towards
Al-Madinah, they did not hesitate to plunder the people. For
instance, an expedition under the leadership of Kurz bin Jabir
al-Fihrl plundered the cattle of the people of Al-Madinah from the
very vicinity of the city to show what their real intentions were. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
was the state of affairs when, in Sha'aban, 2 A. H. (February or
March, 623 A. D.) a big trade caravan of the Quraish, carrying goods
worth $50,000 or so, with only a guard of thirty to forty men, on its
way back from Syria to Makkah, reached the territory from where it
could be easily attacked from Al-Madinah. As the caravan was carrying
trade goods worth thousands of pounds, and was scantily guarded,
naturally Abu Sufyan, who was in charge of it, from his Past
experience feared an attach from the Muslims. Accordingly, as soon as
he entered the dangerous territory, he dispatched a camel rider to
Makkah with a frantic appeal for help. When the rider reached Makkah,
he, following an old custom of Arabia, tore open the ears of his
camel, cut open his nose and overturned the saddle. Then rending his
shirt from front and behind, he began to cry aloud at the top of his
voice, &quot;O people of Quraish dispatch help to protect your
caravan from Syria under the charge of Abu Sufyan, for Muhammad with
his followers is in pursuit of it; otherwise I don't think you will
ever get your goods. Run, run for help.&quot; This caused great
excitement and anger in the whole of Makkah and all the big chiefs of
the Quraish got ready for war. An army, consisting of 600 armored
soldiers and cavalry of 100 riders with great pomp and show marched
out for a fight. They intended not only to rescue the caravan but
also to put to an end, once for all, the new menace from the Muslims
who had consolidated themselves at Al-Madinah. They wanted to crush
that rising power and overawe the clans surrounding the route so as

the Holy Prophet, who always kept himself well informed of the state
of affairs, felt that the decisive hour has come and that was the
right time when he must take a bold step; otherwise the Islamic
Movement would become lifeless for ever and no chance would be left
for it to rise again. For if the Quraish invaded Al-Madinah, the odds
would be against the Muslims. The condition of the Muslim Community

that the consequences of this possible invasion would not be
favorable to the Muslims. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

force. In that case, too, if the Muslim remained inactive, it would
affect their reputation adversely. Obviously, this weak stand in the
conflict would embolden the other Arabs also and make the position of
the Muslims very insecure in the country and the surrounding clans
would, at the instance of the Quraish, start hostilities against
them, and the Jews, the hypocrites and the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">mushriks</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

these speeches it was decided that they should march towards the army
of the Quraish and not towards the trade caravan. But it should be
noted that the decision was of an ordinary nature. For the number of
people, who came forward to go to the battlefield, was only a little
more than three hundred (86 </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Muhajirs</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,

and hardly equipped for battle. Only a couple of them had horses to
ride and the others had to take their turn in threes and fours on the
back of a camel, out of the 70 they had in all. Above all, they had
not got enough weapons for the battle; only 60 of them had armors. It
is, therefore, no wonder that with the exception of those who were
prepared to sacrifice their lives for the cause of Islam, the
majority of those who had joined the expedition, were so filled with
fear that they felt as if they were knowingly going into the jaws of
death. Then there were people who always looked at things from a
selfish point of view. Though they had embraced Islam, they did not
realize that their faith would demand the sacrifice of their lives
and properties from them; they were of the opinion that it was a mad
expedition prompted by irrational enthusiasm for religion. But the
Holy Prophet and the true Believers had realized the urgency of that
critical hour which required the risk of life: therefore they marched
straight to the south-west, wherefrom the army of the Quraish was
coming. This is a clear proof of the fact that from the very
beginning they had gone out to fight with the army and not to plunder
the caravan. For if they had aimed at plundering the caravan they
would have taken the north- westerly direction and not the south-
westerly one. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

It is worth-while to remember the time when those who rejected the
Truth, were making plots against you to capture you or to slay you or
to exile you.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote25anc" HREF="#sdfootnote25sym"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
They were plotting their plots and Allah was devising His schemes:
and Allah's schemes are most effective of all. When Our revelations
were recited to them, they said, &quot;Well, we have heard: if we
will, we also can fabricate such things: for these are the same
ancient tales which have already been told again and again by the
former people. &quot; And recall also to mind the thing they said,
&quot;If it is the Truth and has been sent down by Thee, rain down
stones on us from the heavens or send down any other painful torment
on us.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote26anc" HREF="#sdfootnote26sym"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
At that time Allah would not send down any torment on them for you
dwelt in their midst: nor does Allah chastise people while they are
asking His forgiveness.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote27anc" HREF="#sdfootnote27sym"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
But now there is no reason why He should not send torment on them,
when they are barring the way to the Masjid-i-Haram whereas they are
not its lawful guardians. Indeed the God fearing people alone can be
its lawful guardians, but most of the people do not know this thing:
And what is their &quot;prayer&quot; near the House of Allah ?: it is
nothing but whistling and clapping of hands.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote28anc" HREF="#sdfootnote28sym"><SUP>28</SUP></A>
So now take the chastisement and taste the torment in requital for
your persistent denial of the Truth.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote29anc" HREF="#sdfootnote29sym"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
Those who have denied the Truth spend their wealth in blocking the
way of Allah, and will go on spending still more of it. But in the
end, these very efforts of theirs will become a cause of their
regret; then they will be overcome, and the disbelievers shall be
gathered and driven towards Hell: so that Allah may separate the
filthy from the pure and gather together every sort of filth and then
throw the whole heap into Hell: they are the people who have, in

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>A
	dispute arose among the Muslims concerning the division of the
	spoils of victory after the Battle of Badr, Allah used this
	opportunity for the benefit of the Muslims and gave instructions for
	the solution of the problems of peace and war. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As Badr
	was the first battle fought under the flag of Islam, naturally the
	Muslims were unaware of the Islamic laws about war and the problems,
	created by it. Some preliminary instructions had already been given
	in Surahs Al-Baqarah and Muhammad, but more instructions were needed
	for the &quot;humanization of war&quot;, because their notions were
	still the same that they had during the pre-Islamic days. That is
	why according to the old usage each Muslim claimed to be the
	rightful owner of the spoils which came in his hand after the
	victory. But there were others, who had gone in pursuit of the enemy
	instead of plundering the spoils, They claimed that they, too, were
	entitled to a share of the spoils, for, they said, &quot;If we had
	not pursued the enemies to a long distance, they would have come
	back and by a surprise attack turned the victory into a defeat&quot;.
	There were still others, who were standing guard for the Holy
	Prophet: they also claimed a share, saying that they had rendered
	the greatest service in the Battle by protecting the person of the
	Holy Prophet, for, without this, there could have been no victory at
	all. But the people of the first group who possessed the spoils,
	were adamant and were not amenable to any reason whatever; for them,
	possession was the strongest of all arguments. By and by, the
	dispute began to take a very serious turn. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It was at
	this psychological moment that Allah sent down Surah Al-Anfal and
	chose the same thorny problem for the introduction of the review of
	the Battle of Badr. And it is a miracle of the Divine Book that it
	solved the thorny problem in a few words. The very first sentence-
	&quot;They ask you concerning the bounties?&quot;-that introduced
	the problem contained its solution. The use of the Arabic
	word(anfal), bounties', instead of (ghana'im),spoils of victory',
	provided the answer to the problem. The word(anfal) is the plural of
	(nafl). It means something which is in addition to the thing to
	which one is entitled by right. When that something is from the
	servant, it denotes the additional service to what is obligatory on
	the servant, but when it is from the master it denotes the
	additional reward which is bestowed on the servant as a bounty over
	and above to what the servant is entitled. The verse, therefore,
	implies: &quot;Are you having a dispute concerning the bounties of
	Allah? If these are not the spoils of victory, but the bounties of
	Allah, who arc you to decide about their division? It is for the
	Giver of the bounties to decide whom to give and how much. &quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	conception of the spoils of victory helped to bring about a great
	moral reform in the attitude towards war. Muslims do not go to war
	for the sake of material gains but for the sake of reforming the
	moral and social evils in the world in accordance with the
	principles of the Truth; and that they wage war only when the
	opposing forces make it impossible for them to carry out the reform
	work by means of preaching and teaching. Therefore the reformers
	must keep in view only that aim and object and not the material
	gains that may be bestowed on them by Allah as His bounties. That is
	why the Muslims were warned after the very first battle for the
	cause of Islam to guard themselves against the material gains of the
	battle lest these should become the sole aim and object of the
	fight. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This also
	brought about a great reform in connection with the division of the
	spoils of war. Formerly these spoils became the property of anyone
	who got possession of them, or of the commander or of the king who
	became the owner of the whole of them. In the first case, the
	selfishness of the soldiers of the victorious army led to a bitter
	competition for the grabbing of spoils and sometimes even brought
	about a civil war with all its horrible consequences. In the second
	case, the soldiers would resort to pilfering, which would degrade
	them to the low level of thieves. The Qur'an reformed these evils by
	declaring the spoils of war to be the property of Allah and His
	Messenger, and then further on in v. 41 by laying down equitable
	shares for its fair division. The first reform demanded that all
	these spoils, be they worth much or little, should be brought at one
	place before the chief commander. Then by the second reform,
	one-fifth of this should be kept for the Islamic State for the cause
	of Allah and for the help of the poor, and the remaining part should
	be divided among all those who had taken part in the battle. In this
	way the evils of the age of &quot;ignorance&quot; were reformed to
	the satisfaction of all. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here this
	subtle point should also be kept in view: the Qur'an leaves the
	problem of the division after declaring that these bounties belong
	to Allah and the Messenger, and does not even touch it so that the
	minds should first be prepared for obedience and its acceptance:
	Then in v. 41 it gives the Command for the division of the spoils.
	That is why these have been called the `bounties' here and the
	`spoils' of war in v. 41. &nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote2">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>This
	implies that a man's Faith increases on every occasion he
	acknowledges the Revelations of Allah to be true, and submits to
	them. Most surely his Faith increases and grows, whenever he
	surrenders himself to the Book of Allah and to the teachings of the
	Holy Prophet though they may be against his own desires, his
	opinions, his conceptions, his theories, his habits, his interests,
	his lusts, his comforts, his affections and his friendships. For,
	instead of changing the teachings, he changes himself in accordance
	with the Commands of Allah and the instructions of the Holy Prophet,
	and accepts them for his guidance. In contrast to this, if a
	believer hesitates to accept these, his Faith begins to decrease and
	fade away. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This also
	shows that Faith is not something that is incapable of growth and
	increase and which always remains in one and the same state, but it
	is capable of both improvement and decay. Every denial of the Truth
	corrupts its quality, and likewise every acknowledgment and
	acceptance improves it. But as far as the grading of the rights and
	ranks of the people, according to the acceptance or denial of the
	Truth, is concerned, all the Muslims shall be placed in one and the
	same position, and likewise the non-Muslims. In the Islamic society,
	the legal rights and obligations of all the Muslims shall be the
	same, irrespective of the differences in the quality of the Faith.
	In the same way, the non-Muslims shall be Zimmis or belligerents or
	allies of the same rank, irrespective of the quality of their denial
	of the Islamic Faith.

	blessings to those who perform obligatory duties, and forgives their
	shortcomings by His grace, and rewards His servants with a far
	greater recompense than the one they deserve. Otherwise, if His rule

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>The
	verse may mean either of the two things: as translated it means at
	that time the Truth required that they should go to the fight but
	they were afraid of this; and now the Truth required that they
	should not argue concerning the spoils of war and wait for the
	Command, but they did not seem to submit to this for the sake of the
	Truth. The second meaning will be this: &quot;In the Battle of Badr,
	you have seen with your own eyes the good results of following the
	Truth. Although you were afraid of going to the fight as if you were
	being driven towards death, yet by obeying Allah and His Messenger,
	you won a great victory: likewise, if you now abide by the Truth in

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Incidentally,
	verses 5-6 refute all those traditions about the Battle of Badr that
	are related in the books on the life of the Holy Prophet and his
	wars. They say that the real plan of the Holy Prophet and his
	followers was to plunder the caravan and accordingly they had
	marched out of AI-Madinah for the same purpose. But when they had
	traveled some distance, they learned that an army of the Quraish was
	corning for the protection of the caravan, and they held a council
	to decide whether to attack the caravan or the army. The Qur'an,
	however, contradicts this. It says that Allah brought forth the Holy
	Prophet from his home with the Truth at the very beginning and he
	had this Truth before him that they should meet the army of the
	Quraish in a decisive battle. For these consultations were held
	before they had started from AI-Madinah and not after. It was then
	that some Muslims were arguing with the Holy Prophet concerning the
	Truth that they should go to meet the army of the Quraish, though it
	had become quite evident to them. That was why these people felt as
	though they were being driven towards death, when they were
	commanded to march out of Al-Madinah at the very start of the
	expedition.

	re-enforcements or to join another pan of the army in the rear.
	However, what has been forbidden is a rout in utter defeat,
	involving disorderly and cowardly flight for safety. Such a retreat
	is obviously a heinous sin, because it is to save one's own life and
	it deserves the most painful retreat in Hell. Any one, who runs away
	in disorder from the battlefield, does so because he loves his own
	life more than the cause for which he professed to fight.
	Accordingly the Holy Prophet condemns this emphatically, saying,
	&quot;There are three sins which make virtue vain-shirk, violation
	of the rights of parents and flight from the battlefield, when
	fighting in the Way of Allah.&quot; Likewise in another Tradition,
	he mentions seven sins that are ruinous and destructive for the
	Life-after-death. One of these is that one should turn one's back to
	the disbelievers and run away from the conflict between Islam and
	kufr. Such a rout is condemned because, besides being a cowardly
	act, it leads to serious consequences: the flight of one soldier may
	cause the rout of a platoon and that in turn of a regiment or of the
	whole army. Then it is also possible that the rout of the army might
	ruin the whole country.&nbsp;

	..... who violate the treaties.....&quot; were the Jews. On his
	migration to AI-Madinah, they were the first people with whom the
	Holy Prophet had entered into an alliance to co-operate for mutual
	good. He did his very best to establish good relations with them,
	for he considered them to be nearer to Islam than the mushriks, and
	he preferred their way to those of the mushriks, whenever a choice
	had to be made between the two. But their scholars and rabbis did
	not at all like the pure doctrine of Tauhid, taught by him, and the
	high standard of morality presented by him, and the exertions put in
	by him for the establishment of the Right Way. Therefore, in spite
	of the treaties they were persistently trying to defeat the New
	Movement. Accordingly, they adopted several measures: they conspired
	with the hypocrites of AI-Madinah against the true Muslims: they
	incited the clans of Aus and Khazraj against each other in order to
	kindle the fire of the old enmity that existed between the two
	before the advent of Islam and had led to bloody feuds, and they
	contrived plots with the Quraish and other hostile clans to ruin the
	Muslims. Though the Jews had all along been violating the written
	treaty the Holy Prophet had made with them, their enmity and
	jealousy had become even more furious than before, after the victory
	at Badr. For they had expected that the Movement would receive a
	crushing blow at the hands of the Quraish, but the result had been
	quite the reverse of it. Therefore they increased their inimical
	activities all the more in order to prevent Islam from becoming a
	formidable force. So much so that on hearing the news of the defeat
	of the Quraish, one of their leaders, Ka`ab bin Ashraf, cried out in
	anguish, &quot;Today the bowels of the earth are far better for us
	than its surface&quot;. Accordingly, he himself went to Makkah and
	recited exciting elegies to incite the people of Quraish to wreak
	their vengeance. More than that: the people of one of their clans,
	Bani Qainqa `, setting aside the good neighborly manners, began to
	tease the Muslim women who used to go to their habitations for
	business. When the Holy Prophet reproved them, they gave an impudent
	reply and said, &quot;We are not weak like the Quraish: we are a
	people who know how to fight even to the death: you will have an
	experience of our courage when you encounter us. &quot;&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote43sym" HREF="#sdfootnote43anc">43</A>This
	verse lays down a very clear and strict rule for the breaking of a
	treaty when necessary, and enjoins the Muslims to &quot;throw their
	treaty openly before them&quot; . According to this verse, it is
	unlawful to make a unilateral decision of its termination, even if
	the Muslims felt that the other party with whom they had entered
	into an alliance, was not observing the treaty strictly and
	properly, or if they were afraid that the other party would turn
	treacherous on the first opportunity. Therefore it forbids them to
	treat the other party in a way as if there had been no treaty with
	it at all. On the other hand, this verse binds the Muslims to inform
	the other party in clear words, before taking any step against it,
	that the treaty with it had been terminated. This is essential so
	that the other party should have no misunderstanding whatsoever that
	the treaty was still in force. The Holy Prophet based the
	international policy of Islam on this verse. He decreed, &quot;The
	one that has made a treaty with another party is bound by it until
	the expiry of its teen. Or if obliged, then one should throw it
	before the other party so that both may be set on equal footing&quot;
	. Then he extended the same principle to all other affairs, saying,
	&quot;Behave not treacherously even towards those who are
	treacherous to you&quot; . And he had impressed the same so deeply
	on the minds that this principle was observed most strictly both in
	letter and in spirit. That is why when Amir Mu'aviyah assembled his
	army near the frontiers of the Roman Empire with the intention that
	he would invade their territory immediately after the expiry of the
	term of the treaty, Hadrat Amar bin `Anbasah, a Companion of the
	Holy Prophet, strongly protested against this and recited the same
	Tradition before him according to which even concentration of army
	was a piece of treachery. The Amir had to submit to this, and he
	gave up the concentration of army. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It may
	also be noted that the practice of unilateral abrogation of treaties
	`and invading the enemy without any declaration of war was common
	during the time of `ignorance' in the ancient times and is also in
	vogue in the civilized ignorance: of today. For example, during
	World War' II, Germany invaded Russia, and Britain and Russia took
	military action against Iran without any formal declaration of war.
	It may be noted that the pleas put forward for such breaches and
	violations are very flimsy: it is argued that if a declaration of
	war had been made beforehand, the other party would have taken
	precautionary measures and given a tough fight; or that if they had
	not taken action, their enemy would have forestalled them. But they
	seem to forget that if moral responsibilities were to be set aside
	on such lame excuses, then there remains no crime and no sin that
	cannot be justified on one plea or the other, and every thief, every
	robber; every adulterer, every murderer and every forgerer can put
	forward a justification for his crime or sin. But it is strange that
	the modem leaders have two standards of judgment. While they justify
	the acts of treachery in the international sphere, they condemn the
	same when these are committed in their own national sphere.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is,
	however, an exception to the above principle. The Islamic Law allows
	the Muslims to attack the other party, if it violates the treaty
	openly and takes some specific inimical action against them. In such
	a clear case, this verse does not bind them to give a due notice of
	the termination of the treaty, but grants them the right to take
	military action against such a treacherous party without giving any
	ultimatum. The Muslim jurists have deduced this exception from a
	precedent set by the Holy Prophet. When the Quraish openly broke the
	treaty of Hudaibiyah, in regard to Bani Khuza`ah, he did not
	consider it obligatory to give them a notice that he, too, had
	terminated the same. He, therefore, invaded Makkah without giving
	them any notice. But here we must strike a note of warning. In order
	to take advantage of this exception, we must consider all the
	circumstances under which the Holy Prophet thought it right to
	invade Makkah. In that case, and in that alone, it is lawful for us
	to follow the precedent set by him; otherwise we are liable to take
	undue advantage of it. We learn from the books of Hadith and Sirat
	that the following circumstances led him to take this step:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	violation of the treaty by the Quraish was so glaring that there was
	absolutely no doubt that there had been a breach and they themselves
	confessed that the treaty had come to an end. That is why they sent
	Abu Sufyan to AI-Madinah for its renewal. Though that was a proof
	that they also knew that the treaty had come to an end, it does not
	mean that this exception will be justifiable only if those who
	violate the treaty also know it and confess it. The exception will
	be only justifiable if the violation would be quite clear and beyond
	any doubt. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) After
	the violation of the treaty, the Holy Prophet did not indicate in
	any way whatever by word or by deed or by implication- that in spite
	of the violation of the treaty by them he regarded the treaty to be
	still in force; nor did he continue such relations with them as
	might indicate the same. All the traditions show that he rejected
	the offer of the renewal of the treaty made by Abu Sufyan. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) He
	openly took the military action against the Quraish and did nothing
	at all to show an outward display of peace while harboring secret
	intentions of war. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is
	the excellent precedent set by the Holy Prophet in this matter. An
	exception to the injunction contained in this verse can, therefore,
	be made under such specific circumstances that existed on the
	occasion, and that, too, in the same straightforward noble way. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides,
	it is lawful for the Muslims to use force for the settlement of an
	issue if and when they find that the other party is neither willing
	to solve it by mutual talk nor by international arbitration, but is
	bent upon using force. In such a case, this verse makes it incumbent
	on the Muslims to make a clear and open declaration to this effect
	before taking any action. Islam considers a secret military action
	as immoral and does not allow it, if the Muslims are not prepared to
	make an open declaration of war.

	that the one, who understands clearly the objective for which he is
	fighting would realize that it is more precious than his own life
	which would be meaningless if that object was lost, will possess a
	fighting power far greater than of the one who has no clear
	understanding of the object for which he is fighting, even though

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote49sym" HREF="#sdfootnote49anc">49</A>As
	regards the question why Allah rebuked the Muslims in v. 68 for
	taking ransom, the commentators have cited some traditions.
	According to these, after the Battle of Badr, a consultation was
	held in regard to the prisoners taken from the army of the Quraish.
	Hardrat Abu Bakr was of the opinion that they should be set at
	liberty after the payment of ransom but Hadrat `Umar opined that
	they should be slain. The Holy Prophet agreed to the opinion of
	Hadrat Abu Bakr and set them at liberty after the payment of their
	ransom. At this, Allah sent down this verse as a rebuke. But this
	interpretation is open to some objections. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The first
	difficulty of these interpreters is that they are unable to give a
	satisfactory explanation that might fit into the words: &quot;Had
	there not been a decree that had already been given by Allah....&quot;.
	They say that it refers to the decree that was predestined by Allah
	or it means that Allah had already decreed to snake spoils of war
	lawful though He had not sent down this decree to the Holy Prophet.
	But it is obvious that a thing does not become lawful unless it is
	made so by an explicit Command. The second difficulty is that
	according to this explanation, the Holy Prophet himself and his
	followers become guilty of the sin of taking ransom for prisoners.
	Therefore one would think many times before accepting an explanation
	that is based on traditions emanating from a single source. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In my
	opinion, Allah rebuked the Muslims for not complying fully with the
	condition laid down in the Ordinance in XLVII: 4: &quot;So kill the
	disbelievers until you crush them down; after this you may take them
	as prisoners; and then set them at liberty as a favor or for a
	ransom after the battle comes to an end. According to this previous
	Ordinance, there was nothing wrong in taking prisoners of war and
	charging ransom for them, but what was wrong was that they did not
	fully comply with the prior condition, that is, `until you crush
	them down' . For we learn that, when after the Battle of Badr the
	army of the Quraish was put to rout, many Muslims began to gather
	spoils or to take prisoners and only a few of them went in pursuit
	of the enemy to crush them. Had all the Muslims gone in pursuit of
	them, they would have crushed down their power then and there.
	Therefore Allah rebuked the Muslims (and not the Holy Prophet) as if
	to say, &quot;O Muslims ! you have not yet fully understood the
	meaning of the mission of the Prophet. He is not sent to take
	prisoners and charge ransoms or gather spoils. The main objective of
	his mission is to crush down the powers of disbelief. But you are
	overwhelmed by the worldly Breeds again and again. During the course
	of this campaign, you at first desired to attack the trade caravan
	instead of the army of the Quraish. Then you began to gather spoils
	and take prisoners, and afterwards entered into a dispute regarding
	the division of spoils. Had We not previously given you permission
	for taking ransom (XLVII :4), We would have inflicted a severe
	chastisement on you. Very well, now you may enjoy what you have
	taken, but you should, in future, fear Us and refrain from incurring
	Our displeasure.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Imam
	Jassas also is of the same opinion (as expressed in his book
	Ahkamul-Qur an), and therefore the above interpretation is worth
	considering. This view is also supported by a Tradition related in
	Sirat-i-Ibn Hisham. According to this, the Holy Prophet noticed
	signs of disapproval on the face of Sa`ad bin M'uaz on the occasion,
	when the Muslims were gathering the spoils and taking prisoners. So
	the Holy Prophet said, &quot;O Sa`ad, it appears that you do not
	approve this conduct of the Muslims&quot;. Sa`ad replied, &quot;It
	is so, O Messenger of Allah. This is the first victory that Allah
	has given us over the mushriks. Therefore it would have been much

	their lives by taking them prisoners&quot; . (Volume II, pp.

	guardianship and the like between the citizens and the State and
	vice versa, and between the citizens themselves. Thus it is clear
	that this verse confines the limits of the Islamic, political and

	excludes from this particular relationship the other Muslims who
	live beyond its territorial boundaries. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The legal

	cannot become the inheritors of the Muslims of Dar-ul-Islam and vice

	there be inter-marriages between them; nor can the Islamic State
	appoint a citizen of Dar-ul-Kufr on any responsible post, until that
	one renounces the relationship of citizenship with Dar-ul-Kufr.
	Moreover, this verse affects also the foreign policy of the Islamic
	State and frees it from the responsibility of the Muslims living
	outside its territorial borders by restricting it only to the

	sentence-&quot;unless you also help one another&quot;-has two
	meanings: (1) If it is considered in connection with the previous
	sentence, &quot;the disbelievers help one another,&quot; it means:
	&quot;If you, the Believers, will not help one another just as the
	disbelievers help one another, there will be mischief and great
	disorder on the earth&quot; . (2) But if it is considered in
	connection with the instructions given in v. 72, it will mean: if
	the people living in Dar-ul- Islam (a) do not become the guardians
	and protectors of one another, (b) do not consider the Muslims, who
	have not migrated to Dar-ul-Islam and live in Dar-ul-Kufr, outside
	their political protection, (c) do not. give help to the persecuted
	Muslims, living outside Dar-ul-Islam, when they ask for it, and if
	at the same time, they do not observe the law that the Muslims
	living in Dar-ul-Islam would not help those Muslims living in
	Dar-ul-Kufr among the people with whom they made a treaty of peace,
	and (d) do not break all their friendly relations with the
	disbelievers,-then there will be mischief and great chaos in the
	world.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote53sym" HREF="#sdfootnote53anc">53</A>This
	is to remove a misunderstanding. After migration to AI-Madinah, the
	Holy Prophet had established the relationship of brotherhood between
	the Muhajirin and the Ansar, which gave rise to the misunderstanding
	that they had become the inheritors of one another. This verse says
	that inheritance shall be determined by the blood-relationship and
	not by the relationship of brotherhood in the Faith.&nbsp;
