opposition to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had started but
had not yet become tyrannical. Musnad Ahmad contains a tradition from

he was reciting surah Al-Haaqqah in the Prayer. I stood behind him
and listened. As he recited the Qur'an I wondered at its literary
charm and beauty. Then suddenly an idea came to my mind that he must
be a poet as the Quraish alleged. Just at that moment he recited the
words: &quot;This is the Word of an honorable Messenger: it is not
the word of a poet.&quot; I said to myself: Then, he must be a
soothsayer, if not a poet. Thereupon be recited the words:&quot;Nor
is it the word of a soothsayer: little it is that you reflect. It is
a Revelation from the Lord and Sustainer of the worlds. On hearing
this Islam entered deep into my heart.&quot; This tradition of Hadrat
Umar shows that this surah had been sent down long before his
acceptance of Islam, for even after this event he did not believe for
a long time, and he continued to be influenced in favor of Islam by
different incidents from time to time, till at last in the house of
his own sister he came by the experience that made him surrender and
submit to the Faith completely. (For details, see introduction to
surah Maryam and Introduction to surah Al-Waqiah). </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
first section opens with the assertion that the coming of the
Resurrection and the occurrence of the Hereafter is a truth which has
to take place inevitably. Then in vv. 4-12, it has been stated that
the communities that denied the Hereafter in the past became worthy
of Allah's scourge ultimately. In vv. 13-17 the occurrence of
Resurrection has been depicted. In vv. 18-37 the real object for
which Allah has destined a second life for mankind after the present
worldly life has been enunciated. In it we are told that on that Day
all men shall appear in the Court of their Lord, where no secret of
theirs shall remain hidden each man's record will be placed in his
hand. Those who had spent lives in the world with the realization
that one day they would have to render an account of their deeds
before their Lord, and who had worked righteously in the world and
provided beforehand for their well being in the Hereafter, will
rejoice when they see that they have been acquitted and blessed with
the eternal bliss of Paradise. On the contrary, those who neither
recognized the rights of Allah, nor discharged the rights of men,
will have no one to save them from the punishment of Allah, and they
will be cast into Hell. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

the second section (vv. 38-52) the disbelievers of Makkah have been
addressed and told: &quot;You think this Qur'an is the word of a poet
or soothsayer, whereas it is a Revelation sent dawn by Allah, which
is being presented by the noble Messengers. The Messenger by himself
had no power to increase or decrease a word in it. If he forges
something of his own composition into it, We will cut off his
neck-vein (or heart- vein). For this is the Truth absolute and pure:
and those who give it a lie, will have ultimately to regret and
repent. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	after describing the Qur'an as the Word of an honorable Messenger,

	the tongue of the Holy Prophet and the Holy Prophet by the tongue of

	and in another way of Gabriel, but a little below it has been

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote24sym" HREF="#sdfootnote24anc">24</A>In
	short: &quot;I swear by whatever you see and by whatever you do not
	see that this Qur'an is not the word of a poet or a soothsayer, but
	it is a Revelation from the Lord of the worlds, which is being
	presented by the Messenger who is noble and gentle.&quot; Let us now
	consider in what sense this oath has been sworn. That which was
	visible to the people was:. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) This
	Word was being presented by a person who being noble and gentle was
	not hidden from anybody in the society of Makkah. Everyone knew that
	he was the best man of their nation in conduct. It could not be
	expected of such a man that he would forge a lie and attribute it to
	Allah, Lord of the worlds. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) They
	also saw clearly that he had no selfish motive in presenting that
	word before the people, but had rather sacrificed all His personal
	interests to it: had ruined his business, had abandoned every ease
	and comfort, was being cursed and abused by the same people who had
	shown him the highest veneration and esteem and had caused even his
	family and children to be subjected to these agonies besides
	himself. A person having selfish motives could not have submitted
	himself to such tribulations. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) They
	could also see that the lives of the people in their own society,
	who believed in him, underwent a sudden transformation. The word of
	no poet or soothsayer has been known to have brought about such a
	wonderful moral change in the people that his follower should become
	ready to face every hardship and bear up against every persecution
	for his sake. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) They
	were also not unaware of the language of poetry and the diction of
	the soothsayers. Apart from stubborn disbelievers, no one could say
	that the language of the Qur'an was the language of poetry or
	sorcery. (For a detailed discussion of this, see E.N. 7 of
	AI-Anbiya', E.N.'s 142-145 of Ash-Shu`ara', E.N.22 of At-Tur). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) This
	also was before their eyes that no one in entire Arabia was so
	eloquent of speech that his word could be brought to match with the
	Qur'an. Not to speak of equaling it, not even the greatest poet's
	eloquence could even approach anywhere near the Qur'an's. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) This
	also was not hidden from them that the language used by Muhammad
	(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) himself was very
	different in its literary beauty and merit from the language of the
	Qur'an. No Arabic speaking person could, after hearing the Holy
	Prophet's own speech, and the Qur'an, say that both emanated from
	one and the same person. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) The
	people of Makkah had never heard even until a day before Muhammad
	(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) made the claim to
	Prophethood anything relating to the themes that the Qur'an
	consisted of, nor they knew that he had any means of obtaining that
	knowledge and information. That is why even if his opponents alleged
	that he obtained that information secretly from somewhere, no one in
	Makkah was prepared to believe it. (For explanation, see E.N l07 of

	to the heavens, which was functioning before their eyes, and in
	which they could see a supreme, wise law and, an all-pervading order
	and system at work. In it they could see no sign and evidence of the
	polytheism and denial of the Hereafter, which the Arabs had adopted
	as their creed, but there were signs and proofs of the existence of
	One God and of the truth of the Hereafter which the Qur'an was
	presenting.

	only creatures: none beside Him is God! Resurrection has to take

	blessings) has really been appointed a Messenger by Allah Himself
	Who is sending down the Qur'an to him. An oath has been sworn by
