man sees carefully the variety of animals, the day and night, the

and ponders over them intelligently, without prejudice, he will find
these Signs sufficiently convincing of the truth that this universe
is not Godless, nor under the control of many gods, but it has been
created by One God, and He alone is its Controller and Ruler.
However, the case of the person who is determined not to acknowledge
and wants to remain involved in doubts and suspicions is different.
He cannot be blessed with the faith and conviction from anywhere in
the world. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>A
little below, in the beginning of the second section, it has been
reiterated that the things man is exploiting in the world, and the
countless forces and agencies that are serving his interests in the
universe, did not come into being just accidentally, nor have they
been provided by the gods and goddesses, but it is One God alone, Who
has supplied and subjected these to him from Himself. If only a
person uses his mind properly and rightly, his own intellect will
proclaim that God alone is man's real Benefactor and He alone
deserves that man should pay obeisance to Him. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this, the disbelievers of Makkah have been taken to task and reproved
for their stubbornness, arrogance, mockery and insistence on
disbelief with which they were resisting the invitation of the Qur'an
they have been warned that this Qur'an has brought the same blessing
which had been granted to the children of Israel before, by virtue of
which they became distinguished above all the people of the world.
Then, when they failed to recognize the true worth of this blessing
and disputed their religion and lost it, this blessing now has been
sent to them. This is such a code of guidance which shows the clear
highway of Religion to man. The people who would turn it down by
their own folly, would only prepare for their own doom, and only such
people would become worthy of God's succour and mercy who would adopt
obedience to it and lead a life of piety and righteousness. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this connection, the followers of the Holy Prophet have been
instructed that they should forbear and pardon the absurd and foolish
behavior towards them of the people fearless of God, for if they
showed patience God Himself would deal with their opponents and would
reward them for their fortitude. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

there is a criticism of the erroneous ideas that the disbelievers
hold about the Hereafter. They said that life was only this worldly
life there was no life hereafter. Man dies in the course of time just
as a watch stops functioning suddenly. The body is not survived by
any soul, which might be seized and then breathed again into the
human body some time in the future. In this regard, they challenged
the Holy Prophet, saying: &quot;If you lay a claim to this, then
raise our dead forefathers back to life.&quot; In answer to this,
Allah has given the following arguments: </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Our power, so you do not die of your own accord, but die when We send

ignorance and folly today, you may not; when the time arrives, you
will see for yourself that you are present before your God and your

	this brief introduction to the Surah, the listeners have been warned
	of two things: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	this Book is not the composition of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
	peace) himself, but it is being sent down to him by Allah; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	it is being sent down by that Allah Who is All-Mighty as well as
	All-Wise. His being the Almighty demands that man should not dare
	disobey His Commands, for if he disobeys Him, he cannot escape His
	punishment; and His being the All-Wise demands that man should obey
	and follow His Guidance and His Commands with full satisfaction and
	willingness of the heart, for there can be no possibility of His
	teachings being wrong or inadequate or harmful in any way.&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote2">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>To
	begin the discourse like this after the introduction, indicates that
	in the background there are the objections of the people of Makkah,
	which they were raising against the teachings of the Holy Prophet.
	They said: 'After all, how can we believe this one man when he says
	that all those great beings to whose shrines we have been dedicated
	and devoted so far, are nothing and that Godhead belongs to only One
	God?&quot; About this it is being said that the world is replete
	with the signs of the Reality to which they are being invited. If
	on]y they saw with open eves, they would find those signs in
	themselves and outside them everywhere, which testify that this
	whole universe is the creation of One and only One God, and He alone
	is its Master and Ruler and Controller. It didn't need to be pointed
	out what was the nature of the signs in the earth and heavens, for
	the dispute at that time centered around the point that the
	polytheists were insisting on believing in other gods and deities
	also besides Allah and the Qur'an gave the message that there was
	neither a god nor a deity beside One God. Therefore, it was apparent
	by itself from the content that the signs were of the truth of
	Tauhid and of the refutation of shirk. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the sentence: &quot;The signs are for those who believe,&quot; it
	means that although the signs arc meant for all human beings, only
	those people can reach the right conclusion from their observation,
	who are inclined to believe; as for the heedless people, who live
	like animals and the stubborn people who are resolved not to
	believe, the existence and the non-existence of the signs is equal.
	The splendor and beauty of the garden is for those who can see; a
	blind man cannot perceive any splendor and beauty; for him even the
	existence of the garden is meaningless.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>That
	is, &quot;The case of those who have made up their minds not to
	believe, or of those who have chosen for themselves to remain lost
	in the blind alleys of doubt, is different, but when those who have
	not locked up their hearts against belief and conviction, will
	consider seriously their own creation, the structure of their own
	body, and the variety of animals found on the earth, they will see
	countless such signs as will leave no doubt in their minds that all
	this did not come into being without a God, or that it stood in need
	of more than one Cod for its creation. (For explanation, see A1
	An`am: 37-38, An-Nahl: 5.8, AI-Hajj: 57, AI-Mu'minun: 12-14,
	AI-Furqan: 54, Ash-Shu'ara': 78-81, An-Naml: 64, Ar-Rum: 20-21, 54,

	difference of the night and day is a sign because one follows the
	other with full regularity, because one is bright and the other
	dark, because over a certain period the day goes on shortening and
	the night lengthening gradually till the two become equal in
	duration, then again the day goes on lengthening and the night
	shortening till the two again become equal in duration. These
	different kinds of variations found in the night and the day and the
	great aspects of wisdom that accrue from these, arc a clear pointer
	to the fact that the Creator of the sun and the earth and of every
	thing on the earth is one and that one AII-Powerful Being is keeping
	both these spheres under His control; that that Being is not deaf
	and blind and unwise but All-Wise, Who has established this
	unalterable system and made His earth a suitable place for the
	countless species of life, which He has created here in the form of
	vegetables, animals and men. (For explanation, see Yunus: 67, An

	circulation of the winds implies the circulation of the different
	kinds of winds at different times, on different parts of the earth
	and at different heights, which cause change of the seasons. What
	deserves attention is not only that above the surface of the earth
	there is a thick atmosphere, which contains all those elements
	needed by living beings for breathing, and this thick covering has
	kept the earth's population safe from many of the heavenly
	calamities. Besides, another noteworthy thing is that the air is not
	just filled inertly in the atmosphere, but it blows occasionally in
	different ways. Sometimes a cool wind blows and sometimes a hot
	wind; sometimes it stops blowing and sometimes it starts blowing;
	sometimes it blows soft and sometimes strong, and sometimes it
	assumes the proportions of a storm, sometimes a dry wind blows and
	sometimes a moist wind; sometimes it brings the rain and sometimes
	it drives away the clouds. These different kinds of the winds do not
	blow without a purpose, but under a law and a system, which
	testifies that this arrangement is based on perfect wisdom, and it
	is serving great objectives. Then it is deeply related with coolness
	and heat, which go on increasing and decreasing according to the
	changing conditions and relationships between the earth and the sun.
	Furthermore, it has a deep relation with the seasonal changes and
	the distribution of the rain. All these facts proclaim that these
	arrangements have not been made haphazardly by some blind nature,
	nor have the sun and the earth and the air and water and vegetation
	and animals separate controllers, but inevitably One God alone is
	the Creator of them all, and it is His Wisdom that has established
	this system for a great objective, and it is His power that it is
	functioning regularly according to a pre-ordained law.&nbsp;

	other words, there is a marked difference between the person who
	listens to Allah's Revelations sincerely with an open mind and
	ponders over them seriously and the person who listens to them
	resolved that he would deny them, and then persists in the resolve
	already made without any serious thought. If the first person does
	not believe in the Revelations immediately, it does not mean that he
	wants to remain an unbeliever, but because he wants to have greater
	satisfaction. Therefore, even if he is taking time to believe, it is
	just possible that another Revelation might enter his heart and he
	might believe sincerely with full satisfaction. As for the other
	person, he would never believe in any Revelation whatever, for he
	has already locked his heart up to every Revelation of Allah. In

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) &quot;That
	the believers should pardon the excesses of this wicked group so

	have suffered for His sake.&quot;

	punish them for their persecutions of them.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	other commentators have regarded this verse as repealed. They say
	that this command was applicable only till the Muslims had not been
	permitted to fight. Then, when they were permitted to fight, this
	command became abrogated. But a careful study of the words of the
	verse shows that the claim about abrogation is not correct. The word
	&quot;pardon&quot; is never used in the sense that when a person is
	not able to retaliate upon another for the latter's excesses, he
	should pardon him, but on such an occasion the usual words are
	patience and forbearance. Instead of them, when the word &quot;pardon&quot;
	has been used here, it by itself gives the meaning that the
	believers, in spite of their ability for retaliation, should refrain
	from retaliating upon the people for their excesses, whom
	fearlessness of God has made to transgress all limits of morality
	and humanity. This command does not contradict those verses in which
	the Muslims have been permitted to fight. Permission to fight
	pertains to the condition when the Muslim government has a
	reasonable ground for taking military action against an unbelieving
	people, and the command concerning forgiveness and pardon pertains
	to the common conditions in which the believers have to live in
	contact with a people who are fearless of God and have to suffer
	persecutions by them in different ways. The object of this command
	is that the Muslims should keep their moral superiority and should
	not stoop to the Level of the morally inferior people by indulging
	in disputes and wrangling with them and resort to retaliation for
	every frivolity. As long as it is possible to respond to an
	accusation or objection gently and rationally, or to defend oneself
	against an excess, one should not refrain from this, but when things
	seem to be crossing these limits, one should hold one's peace and
	entrust the matter to Allah. If the Muslims themselves become
	involved in a fight or quarrel with them, Allah will leave them
	alone to deal with them; but if they pardon and forbear, Allah will
	Himself deal with the wicked people and reward the oppressed ones
	for their patience.&nbsp;

	is the moral reasoning for the truth of the Hereafter. The

	in deeds necessarily demands that the good and the evil people
	should not meet with one and the same end, but the good should be
	rewarded for their good and the wicked punished for their evil
	deeds. Otherwise, if the good and the evil end up similarly, the
	distinction of virtue and vice in morals becomes meaningless and God
	becomes unjust. The people who follow evil ways in the world do want
	that there should be no accountability and no rewards and
	punishments, for this concept goes against their enjoyment of life,
	but it is against the justice and wisdom of the Lord of the worlds
	that He should treat the good and the evil alike, and should not
	care to see how the righteous believer has lived his life in the
	world and how the sinful unbeliever has been enjoying it. One of
	them kept himself subjected to moral restrictions all his life,
	rendered the rights of those to whorl they were due, restrained
	himself from the unlawful benefits and pleasures, and continued to
	incur losses for the sake of the truth; the other fulfilled his
	desires in every possible wary: neither recognized the rights of God
	nor hesitated froth violating the rights of the people, but watt un
	collecting benefits and good things of life in every possible way.
	Can it be expected of God that He would overlook the difference
	between the lives of the two kinds of men? If the end of both be the

	whether God has forbidden it, and should not do what one dislikes,

	the context in which this verse occurs, it becomes obvious that only
	those people deny the Hereafter, who want to serve their lusts and
	who regard belief in the Hereafter as an obstacle to their freedom.
	Then, once they. have denied the Hereafter, their servitude of the
	self goes on increasing and they go on wandering further into
	deviation. They commit every kind of evil without feeling any
	qualms; they do not hesitate to usurp the rights of others; they
	cannot be expected to restrain themselves when there is an
	opportunity for them to commit an excess or injustice only because
	of a regard for justice and truth in their hearts. The events and
	incidents that can serve as a warning for a man, are witnessed by
	them too, but they draw the wrong conclusion that whatever they are
	doing is right and they should do the same. No word of advice moves
	them; no argument, which can stop a man from evil, appeals to them;
	but they go on devising and furnishing more and more arguments to
	justify their unbridled freedom, and their minds remain day and
	night engaged only in devising ways and means of fulfilling their
	own interests and desires in every possible way instead of engaging
	in a good thought. This is an express proof of the fact that the
	denial of the Hereafter is destructive for human morals. The only
	thing that can restrain man within the bounds of humanity is the
	feeling that man is not irresponsible but has to render an account
