<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
could not be known from any authentic tradition, but a study of its
subject matter shows that this Surah also was sent down in the same
period in which the Surahs Al-Mumin, As-Sajdah and Ash-Shura, were
sent down. It appears that the revelation of this series of the
Surahs began when the disbelievers of Makkah were planning to put an
end to the Holy Prophet's life. Day and night they were holding
consultations in their assemblies as how to eliminate him, and even
an attack on his life also had been made as has been clearly referred
to in vv. 79-80. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this Surah a forceful and severe criticism has been made of the
Quraish and the common Arabs creeds and superstitions of ignorance in
which they persisted, and their stubbornness has been exposed in a
firm and effective way, so that every member of the society, who was
reasonable in some degree, should be made to consider the evils in
which the community was involved and its tyrannical treatment of the
person who was trying to redeem it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
discourse starts in a way as if to say: &quot;You, by means of your
mischiefs, want that the revelation of this Book should be stopped,
but Allah has never withheld the appointment of His Prophets and the
revelation of His Books because of the mischief of the people, but
has destroyed the wicked people, who obstructed the way of His
guidance. The same He will do again. A little further in vv. 41-43
and 79-80 the same thing has been reiterated. Though the people who
were plotting against his life are meant, the Holy Prophet has been
addressed to the effect: &quot;whether you remain alive or not, We
will certainly punish the wicked,&quot; and the people themselves
have been plainly warned to the effect: &quot;If you have decided to
take an action against Our Prophet, We too will take a decisive
action.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
it has been told what is the reality of the religion that the people
are following so devotedly and what are the arguments on whose
strength they are resisting Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
Blessings). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They
themselves admit that the Creator of the earth and heavens and of
themselves and their deities is only Allah. They also know and admit
that the blessings they are benefiting from, have been bestowed by
Allah; yet they insist on making others associates of Allah in His
Godhead. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They
believe that the angels are goddesses; they have carved their images
as females; they adorn them with female dresses and ornaments, and
call them daughters of Allah: they worship them and invoke them for
the fulfillment of their needs. How did they know that the angels
were female? </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
they are rebuked for these superstitions, they present the pretense
of destiny and say :&quot;Had Allah disapproved of these our
practices, we could not have worshiped these images, whereas the
means of finding out whether Allah had approved of something or not,
are His Books and not those things which are happening in the world
according to His Will. For under His Will not only idol worship but
crimes like theft and adultery, robbery. murder, etc. also are being
committed. Can this argument be used to justify as right and proper
this commission of every crime and evil is the world? </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
it is asked: Have you any other authority, apart from this wrong
argument, for the polytheism of yours? They reply, &quot;The same has
been the practice since the time of our forefathers.&quot; In other
words, this in their opinion is a strong enough argument for a
creed's being right and true, whereas the Prophet Abraham, descent
from whom is the only basis of their pride and distinction, had
rejected the religion of his elders and left his home, and he had
discarded every such blind imitation of his forefathers, which did
not have the support of any rational argument. Then, if these people
had to follow their elders only, for this also they selected their
most ignorant elders and abandoned their most illustrious elders like
the Prophets Abraham and Ishmael (on whom be peace). </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">When
they are asked: &quot;Has ever a Prophet or a Book sent down by God
also given this teaching that others beside Allah too are worthy of
worship? they present this practice of the Christians as an argument
that they took Jesus son of Mary as son of God and worshiped him;
whereas the question was not this whether the community of a Prophet
had committed </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">shirk</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

Jesus son of Mary had never said that he was son of God and that the
people should worship him. His own was the same teaching which every
other Prophet had given &quot;My Lord as well as your Lord is Allah:
so worship Him alone.&quot; </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They
were disinclined to believe in the Prophethood of the Holy Prophet
because he was neither a rich man nor a person of high worldly
position and rank. They said &quot;Had Allah willed to appoint a
prophet among us, He would have appointed one of the great men of'
our two cities (Makkah and Taif). On that very basis, Pharaoh also
had looked down upon the Prophet Moses and said: &quot;If Allah, the
King of the heavens, had to send a messenger to me, the king of the
earth, He would have sent him with bracelets of gold and a company of
angels in attendance. Where from has this mendicant appeared I am
superior to him, for the kingdom of Egypt belongs to me, and the
canals of the River Nile are flowing under my control. What is the
status of this man as against me? He has neither wealth nor
authority.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thus,
after criticizing each practice of ignorance of the disbelievers and
rejecting it with rational arguments, it has been pointed out:
&quot;Neither has God any offspring, nor are there separate gods of
the earth and heavens, nor is there any intercessor who may be able
to protect from His punishment those who adopt deviation knowingly.
Allah is far above this that He should have children. He alone is the
God of the whole Universe: all others are His servants and not
associates in His attributes and powers, and only such men can
intercede with Him, who are themselves followers of the Truth and
they also can intercede only for those who may have adopted obedience
of the Truth in the world.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	al-Kitab&quot;: the &quot;Original Book&quot;: the Book from which
	all the Books sent down to the Prophets have been derived. In Surah
	AI-Waqi`ah the same thing has been described as Kitab-um-Maknun (the
	hidden and preserved Book) and in Surah AI-Buruj 22 as Lauh-i Mahfuz
	(the Preserved Tablet), that is, the Tablet whose writing cannot be
	effaced, which is secure from every kind of interference. By saying
	that the Qur'an is inscribed in Umm al-Kitab, attention has been
	drawn to an important truth. Different Books had been revealed by
	Allah in different ages to different Prophets for the guidance of
	different nations in different languages, but all these Books
	invited mankind to one and the same Faith: they regarded one and the
	same thing as the Truth; they presented one and the same criterion
	of good and evil; they propounded the same principles of morality
	and civilization; in short, they brought one and the same Din
	(Religion). The reason was that their source and origin was the
	same, only words were different; they had the same meaning and theme
	which is inscribed in a Source Book with Allah, and whenever there
	was a need, He raised a Prophet and sent down the same meaning and
	subject-matter clothed in a particular diction according to the
	environment and occasion. Had Allah willed to raise the Prophet
	Muhammad (upon whom be His peace) in another nation instead of the
	Arabs, He would have sent down the same Qur'an in the language of
	that nation. In it the meaning and content would have been expressed
	according to the environments and conditions of the people and land;
	the words would have been different and the language also different
	but the teaching and guidance the same basically, and it would be
	the same Qur'an though not the Arabic Qur'an. This same thing has
	been expressed in Surah Ash-Shu`ara, thus: &quot;This (Book) has
	been revealed by the Lord of the worlds. The trustworthy Spirit has
	come down with it upon your heart so that you may become one of
	those who are (appointed by God) to warn (the people) in plain
	Arabic language; and this is also contained in the scriptures of the
	former peoples.&quot; (vv. 192-196). (For explanation, see

	sins and injustices and tyrannies on the way? Can a person think or
	utter these words from his mouth when he intends to go to meet a
	prostitute, or to visit a club for the purpose of drinking and
	gambling? Can a ruler, or a government official, or a merchant who
	has stepped out of his house with such thoughts and such words at
	his lips, usurp the rights of others when he reaches his
	destination? Can a soldier utter these words while boarding his

	&quot;When you have adopted obedience of your ancestors, ,you have

	their ignorant forefathers who had given up the way of the Prophets
	and adopted polytheism from the neighboring idol-worshipers.

	has been pointed out. That is, if the blind imitation of the
	fore-fathers, without the distinction of good and evil, had been the
	right thing, the Prophet Abraham should have done so in the first

	could not follow their creed of ignorance in which they had
	abandoned the Creator and made those imaginary beings their deities,
	who were not the creator. This shows that the Prophet Abraham did
	not believe in following the forefathers, but his creed was that
	before one followed the forefathers one should see whether they were
	following the right way or not, and if it became known by reason

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, it

	distributing the mercy of your Lord ? Is it for them to decide whom

	Allah's mercy is implied His general mercy from which everyone has a
	share). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second,
	Allah says: Prophethood is a great blessing: We have even kept the
	distribution of the common means of life in the world in Our own
	hand, and have not entrusted it to anyone else. We create someone
	beautiful and another ugly, someone with a sweet voice and another
	with a harsh voice, someone robust and strong and another weak and
	frail, someone intelligent and another dull, someone with a strong
	memory and another forgetful, some with healthy limbs and another a
	cripple, or blind or deaf and dumb, someone in a rich family and
	another among the poor, someone in an advanced country and another
	in a backward community. No one can do anything about this destiny
	concerning birth. One is compelled to be what We have made him. And
	it is in no one's power to avert the impact one's circumstances of
	birth have on one's destiny. Then it is We our self Who arc
	distributing provisions, power, honor, fame, wealth, government,
	etc. among men. No one can degrade the one whom We have blessed with
	good fortune, and no one can save from ruin the one whom We have
	afflicted with misfortune. All plans and schemes of man become
	ineffective against Our decrees. In this universal Divine System,
	therefore, how can these people decide as to whom should the Master
	of the universe make His Prophet and whom He should not? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly,
	&quot;An abiding principle that We have kept in view in this Divine
	System is that everything should not be given to one and the same
	person, or everything should not be given to everybody. If you look
	around carefully, you will see that great differences exist between
	the people in every respect. We have given one thing to one person
	but deprived him of another, and given the same to another one. This
	is based on the wisdom that no human being should become independent
	of others, but everyone should remain dependent on the other in one
	way or the other. Now if would be foolish on your part to think that
	We should have given the Prophet hood also to the same person whom
	We had blessed with wealth and nobility. Likewise, will you also say
	that wisdom, knowledge, wealth, beauty, power, authority and all
	other excellences should be assembled in one and the same person,

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	when Allah sends His Prophet to a country and nation and affords it
	the opportunity which He has now given to the Arabs by appointing
	the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) to Prophet hood,
	and it, instead of taking advantage of it, commits the folly of

	Dreadful rain and hail-storms accompanied by lightning and thunder

	</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) Frogs

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) The
	torment of blood appeared precisely as foretold by Moses, which
	turned the water of all canals, wells, springs, pools and cisterns
	into blood. The fish died and the water smelled so bad that the
	Egyptians could not drink from it for a full week. This evil also
	was averted when the Prophet Moses was asked to pray for its
	removal. For details, see Al A'raf: 130-136. An-Naml: 12 and E.N. 37
	of Al-Mu'min.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Chapters
	7 to 10 of Exodus also contain the details of these calamities, but
	it is a combination of gossip and truth. It says that when the

	miracle, but when the calamity of the lice came, the magicians could
	not produce lice in response, and they said that it was God's work.
	Even more strange than this is that when the storm of the frogs
	came, the magicians also brought about frogs, but in spite of that
	Pharaoh requested only the Prophet Moses to pray to God to take away
	the frogs. The question is when the magicians could produce frogs,
	why didn't Pharaoh get the frogs taken away through them? And how
	did it become known which of the frogs were Allah's work and which
	of the magicians'? The same question arises about the blood. When
	according to the warning of Moses water became blood everywhere,
	which water did the magicians turn into blood? And how was it known
	that the water of a particular place had turned blood by the power
	of the magicians? Such are the things which show that the Bible does
	not consist of purely Divine revelation, but the people who wrote it
	mixed up many things in it from their own imagination. The pity,

<DIV ID="sdfootnote44">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote44sym" HREF="#sdfootnote44anc">44</A>The
	stubbornness of Pharaoh and the chiefs of his people can be judged
	from the fact that when distressed by the torment they wanted the
	Prophet Moses to pray for its removal, even then they did not
	recognize him as a Prophet but addressed him as a magician, whereas
	they were not unaware of the truth about magic, and they also knew
	that those miraculous things could not be brought about by the power
	of magic. The most that a magician can do is that in a limited area
	he can so influence the people present in front of him as to make
	them feel that water has become blood, or frogs are coming out in
	large numbers or swarms of locusts are advancing. And within this
	limited place also no water will actually become blood, but water
	will remain water as soon as it comes outside it; no frog will be
	produced in actual fact, but will prove to be an imaginary thing as
	soon as brought outside the circle; locusts also would be imaginary:
	they would not be able to destroy any crop. As for this that a
	famine appears throughout a country, or that the canals and springs
	and wells of the country are filled with blood, or that swarms of
	locusts spread over thousands of square miles and eat up crops
	growing over lakhs of acres, this has neither been accomplished by a
	magician so far, nor can it ever happen by the power of magic.
	Should such magicians be there in the service of a king, he need not
	keep forces and fight wars; he could conquer the whole world by the
	power of magic. Even if the magicians possessed such power, they
	would not seek service under the kings, but would assume kingship
	themselves. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	commentators in general have been perplexed as to why Pharaoh and
	his courtiers addressed the Prophet Moses as &quot;O sorcerer,&quot;
	when they requested him to pray for the removal of the calamity, for
	the one who seeks another's help in a hard time flatters him and
	does not condemn him. They have given the interpretation that
	sorcery in the Egypt of those days was held as a very respectable
	art, and when they addressed Moses as &quot;O sorcerer&quot; they
	did not condemn him, but honored him because it amounted w calling
	him as &quot;O Learned man&quot; But this interpretation is
	absolutely wrong on the ground that wherever at other places in the
	Qur'an Pharaoh's sayings have been cited in which he had called the
	Prophet Moses a sorcerer and the miracles presented by him sorcery,
	the sense of condemnation and contempt becomes apparent, and it
	becomes manifestly clear that sorcery was false in his sight, which
	he imputed to the Prophet Moses so as to prove his claim to the
	Prophet hood to be false !Therefore, it cannot be acceptable that
	suddenly at this time &quot;sorcerer&quot; became the title of an
	honorable and Learned man in his sight. As for the question: Why did
	the Prophet Moses accede to his request at all when even while
	requesting him for the prayer, Pharaoh insulted him publicly, the
	answer is that the object before the Prophet Moses was to strengthen
	the case against those people by Allah's command. Their request to
	him to pray for the removal of the torment by itself proved that in
	their heart of hearts they had come to know why the torments were
	occurring, who was sending them and who could avert them. In spite
	of that, when they called him a &quot;sorcerer&quot; stubbornly, and
	went back on their word of following the right way as soon as the
	torment was averted, they in fact, did not do any harm to Allah's
	Prophet, but only caused the case and argument to be strengthened
	against themselves, which Allah at last decided against them with
	their total destruction. When they called him a sorcerer, this did
	not mean that they believed in their hearts as well that the
	torments against them were coming by the power of sorcery, but they
	realized it fully well that those were Allah's Signs and yet they
	denied them deliberately. The same thing has been said in Surah
	An-Naml: 14: &quot;They rejected those Signs out of sheer injustice
	and vanity, whereas in their heart of hearts they were convinced. &quot;&nbsp;

	other requests (vv. 27-36). Moreover, orations of the Prophet Moses

	implied by &quot;he&brvbar;? According to Hadrat Hasan Basri and
	Said bin Jubair it implies the Quran. That is, one can learn from
	the Qur'an that Resurrection will come. But this commentary is
	irrelevant to the context. There is nothing in the context on the
	basis of which it may be said that it refers to the Qur'an. Other
	commentators almost unanimous]y have expressed the opinion that it
	implies the prophet Jesus Christ, and this is suitable to the
	context. Now the question is: In what sense has Jesus Christ been
	called a Sign or a means of the knowledge of Resurrection? Ibn
	'Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Qatadah, Suddi, Dahhak, Abul `Aliyah and
	Abu Malik say that this refers to the second coming of the Prophet
	Jesus as has been foretold in a large number of the Traditions, and
	the verse means that when he comes the second time to the world, it
	wilt become known that Resurrection is not far behind. But in spite
	of the great authority that these scholars hold it is difficult to
	believe that in this verse the second advent of the Prophet Jesus
	has been called a Sign of Resurrection, or a means of its knowledge.
	For it is contradicted by the next verse. His second advent, indeed,
	can be a means of the knowledge of Resurrection only for those
	people who will be living in that future period or will be born
	after that. How could he be regarded as a means of the knowledge for
	the pagans of Makkah, who are being asked &quot;not to have any
	doubt about it&quot;? Therefore, the correct interpretation in our
	opinion is the one that has been given by some other commentators,
	according to which the Prophet Jesus' birth without a father and his
	making a bird out of clay and his raising the dead back to life has
	been presented as a proof of the possibility of Resurrection. So,
	the Divine Words would mean: why do you think it is impossible for
	God to raise you and all mankind from death when He can create a
	child without a father and a servant of His can breathe life into an
	image of clay and raise the dead back to life?&quot; &nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote68">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote68sym" HREF="#sdfootnote68anc">68</A>This
	sentence has several meanings: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) Those
	whom the people have made their deities in the world, will not at
	all be their intercessors before Allah. Those of them who were
	wicked, will themselves be presented as culprits there. However,
	those who had borne witness to the Truth by virtue of knowledge (and
	not unconsciously) will certainly be able to intercede for others. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) Those
	who will be permitted to intercede, will be able to do so only for
	those who had testified to the Truth consciously (and not
	heedlessly). They will neither intercede of their own will, nor will
	have the permission to intercede for anyone who had gone and been
	led astray from the Truth in the world, or had been affirming the
	faith in Allah as the only Deity unconsciously as well as serving
	other deities at the same time 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) If a
	person says that those whom he has made gods necessarily possess the
	powers of intercession, and they wield such an influence with Allah
	that they can have anyone they like forgiven, irrespective of his
	beliefs and deeds, is totally wrong. No one enjoys such a position
	with Allah. If the one who claims that another has such powers of
	intercession, can testify to the truth of this matter by virtue of
	knowledge, one should have the courage to say so. But if one is not
	in a position to bear such a testimony, and one is certainly not, it
	would be sheer folly to invent such a creed on the basis of mere
	hearsay, or conjecture, and risk one's life hereafter relying only
	on an imaginary support. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Incidentally,
	this verse also gives two important principles: First, it shows that
	bearing a testimony to the truth without knowledge may be reliable
	in the world, but it is not so before Allah. In the world, whoever
	affirms the Faith verbally will be regarded as a Muslim and treated
	as such unless he openly commits an act expressly contradictory to
	belief. But as before Allah only such a one will be counted as a
	Muslim, who has uttered Lailaha ill-Allah consciously, with full
	understanding of what he is denying and what he is affirming
	according to his best knowledge. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	it gives this principle of the law of evidence that knowledge is a
	pre-requisite of bearing the evidence. If the bearer of an evidence
	has no knowledge of the event to which he is bearing evidence, his
	evidence is meaningless. The same is borne out by a decision given
	by the Holy Prophet. He said to a witness: &quot;If you saw what
	happened with your own eyes as you are seeing the sun, then you may
	bear the witness, otherwise not.&quot; (Ahkam al-Qur an by al
	Jassas).&nbsp; &quot;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote69">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote69sym" HREF="#sdfootnote69anc">69</A>This
	verse has two meanings: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) &quot;If

<DIV ID="sdfootnote70">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote70sym" HREF="#sdfootnote70anc">70</A>This
	is one of the most difficult verses of the Qur'an as it involves the
	complicated syntactic question of the kind of waw that has been used
	in wa qil-i-hi. From the translation of Shah 'Abdul Qadir it appears
	that the waw here is not conjunctive but for taking oath, and is
	related to fa-anna yu'fakun, and the pronoun in gili-hi turns to the
	Holy Prophet of Allah. Therefore, the verse means this: &quot;By
	this saying of the Messenger: `O my Lord, these are a people who
	would not believe'&quot;: they are so utterly deluded that although
	they themselves admit that Allah alone is their Creator and Creator
	of their gods, yet they abandon the Creator and persist in
	worshiping His creatures.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	object of swearing by this saying of the Messenger is that the
	conduct of the people clearly shows that they are, in fact,
	stubborn, for the foolishness of their attitude is apparent from
	their own admission, and such an irrational attitude can be adopted
	only by such a person, who is resolved not to believe. In other
	words, the oath implies: `The Messenger has rightly said so: indeed
	these people world not believe,&quot;&nbsp;
