exact period of its revelation is not known from any reliable
tradition. However, the style shows that it is either the middle or
the early Makkan period. If it is the middle period, it was probably
its initial stage when the persecution had not yet become tyrannical
and the Islamic movement was being suppressed only by resort to
derision and ridicule, rumor mongering, false allegations and casting
of evil suggestions in the people's minds. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

the Hereafter, and about his Prophethood itself, mostly in the form
of absurd allegations and taunts and mockery. These objections have
been answered, sometimes by citing them and sometimes without citing
them, and the discourse itself shows which objection is being
answered at a particular place. The answers mostly take the form of
instruction and admonition and argument, but at some places the
disbelievers have been warned also of the evil consequences, of their
stubbornness. In this connection, the stories of the Sabaeans and the
Prophets David and Solomon have been related to impress this lesson:
&quot;You have both these historical precedents before you. On the
one hand, there were the Prophets David and Solomon, who had been
blessed by Allah with great powers and such grandeur and glory as had
been granted to hardly any people before them. In spite of this, they
were not proud and arrogant, but remained grateful servants of their
Lord. They were never rebellious. On the other hand, there were the
people of Saba, who, when blessed by Allah, became proud, and were
consequently so thoroughly destroyed and dispersed as to be
remembered only in myths and legends. With these precedents in view,
you may see and judge for yourselves as to which bind of the life is
better: that which is built on belief in </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Tauhid</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

	forbid) a falsehood deliberately, or he is mad.' But this accusation
	of madness also was as absurd as of falsehood, for a stupid person
	only could admit that such a wise and intelligent man as the Holy
	prophet could be mad. That is why Allah did not feel it was
	necessary to refute their absurd charge by an argument, and only
	made mention of their wonder which they expressed at the possibility
	of the life-after-death

	is the second answer to their charge. To understand it well one
	should bear in mind the fact that three things were most prominent
	among the reasons for which the disbelieving Quraish denied the
	life-after-death: (1) They did not want to believe in any kind of
	accountability before God, for after believing in such a thing they
	would be left with no freedom whatever to behave and act as they
	pleased in the world. (2) They thought it was inconceivable that
	Resurrection would take place and the present material order of the
	universe would be destroyed and replaced by a new order. (3) They
	thought it was impossible that the people who had died hundreds of
	thousands of years in the past and whose bones even had decayed and
	disintegrated, would be raised back to life. With the same body and
	soul. The answer given above covers all these three aspects, and
	contains a severe warning as well. The details of the theme
	contained in these brief sentences are given below: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) If
	you ever had observed this earth and the heavens with clear
	sightedness, you would have seen that it is not a plaything nor has
	its creation come into being by accident. Everything in this
	universe points to the fact that it has been created by an
	All-Powerful Being with great wisdom. In such a wise system it would
	be highly absurd to think that somebody could be left to live an
	irresponsible and unaccountable life after he had been given the
	faculties of intellect and discrimination and authority. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Anyone who sees the natural order with discerning eyes will realize
	that the occurrence of Resurrection is not at all difficult. It can
	take place suddenly as soon as the system in which the earth and the
	heavens are bound together is disturbed. And the same system
	testifies that the One Who has made and is running this world today
	can create another world again. If it were difficult for Him to do
	so, this world would not have existed as it does today. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) Your
	opinion and judgment about the Creator of the universe that it will
	be impossible for Him to resurrect the dead, is strange. The bodies
	of the men who die may utterly decay and disintegrate and be
	scattered but nevertheless remain within the bounds of this very
	universe and do not go anywhere outside its bounds. Then it is not
	at all difficult for the God Who has created this earth and the
	heavens to gather together everything from the earth and water and
	air wherever it happens to be. Whatever makes up your body today was
	collected and combined by Him, and brought out from this very earth,
	water and air. When the collecting and assembling of these elements
	together is possible today, how will it be impossible tomorrow? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides
	these three arguments, the discourse also contains a subtle warning
	to the effect: &quot;You arc surrounded by God's Kingdom on all
	sides. Wherever you may go, you would be covered and surrounded by
	the same universe. You cannot find any place of refuge against God,
	and God's power is such that He can afflict you whenever He likes
	with a calamity from under your feet or from above your heads. You
	do not know what forces might be working under the very surface of
	the earth which you find as an abode of perfect peace and safety for
	yourselves, and when they would cause an earthquake to take place
	and turn the' same earth into your grave. You do not know when a
	disaster might befall you-a lightning. or a devastating rain, or
	some other calamity-from the same sky under which you walk about
	with full peace and satisfaction of the heart as if it were the
	ceiling of your own house. In a state like this, your fearlessness
	of God, your heedlessness of any thought of the Hereafter and your
	vain and nonsensical talk against the admonition of a well-wisher
	has no other meaning than that you are only inviting your own
	doom.&quot;&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote20">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote20sym" HREF="#sdfootnote20anc">20</A>The
	word tamathil in the Text is the plural of timthal, which in Arabic
	is used for every such thing as is made to resemble a natural thing,
	whether it is a human being, an animal, a tree, a flower, a river,
	or some inanimate object. Timthal is the name of every artificial
	thing which may have been made to resemble something made by God. &quot;
	(Lisan al- Arab). &quot;Timthal is every such picture which may have
	been made to resemble the likeness of something else, whether living
	or dead.&quot; (The Commentary, Al-Kashshaf). On this basis the
	statement of the Qur'an does not necessarily imply that the &quot;images&quot;
	made for the Prophet Solomon were the pictures or images of human
	beings and animals. They might have been floral designs or natural
	landscape or different kinds of decorations with which the Prophet
	Solomon might have decorated his buildings and works. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	misunderstanding has been created by some commentators who have
	stated that the Prophet Solomon had got the pictures of the Prophets
	and the angels made for himself. They took such things from the
	Israelite traditions and then explained them saying that in the
	former Shari'ahs it was not forbidden to make the pictures. But
	while accepting and citing these traditions without question, these
	scholars did not keep in mind the fact that the Prophet Solomon was
	a follower of the Mosaic Law and in that Law also making of the
	pictures and images of human beings and animals was forbidden as it
	is in the Shari'ah of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace). And
	they also did not remember that because of the enmity which a
	section of the Israelites bore against the Prophet Solomon they have
	accused him of crimes like polytheism, idolatry, sorcery and
	adultery. Therefore. one should not place reliance on the Israelite
	traditions and accept anything about this great Prophet, which might
	contradict any Shari'ah enjoined by God. Everyone knows that all the
	Prophets who came after the Prophet Moses till the Prophet Jesus
	among the Israelites were the followers of the Torah, and none of
	them had brought forth a new law, which might have abrogated the Law
	of the Torah. Now the Torah clearly enjoins repeatedly that making
	of the pictures and images of human beings and animals is absolutely
	forbidden. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Thou
	shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	face of these clear and express injunctions how can it be accepted
	that the Prophet Solomon might have employed the jinns to make
	pictures and images of the Prophets and the angels for him? And how
	can this thing be admitted on the authority of the statements of the
	Jews who accuse the Prophet Solomon of idolatry due to his love for
	polytheistic wives? (t Kings, oh., 11). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">However,
	the Muslim commentators, while citing the Israelite traditions, had
	made it clear that in the Shari'ah of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
	peace) this thing is forbidden; therefore, it is no more lawful for
	anybody to make pictures and images in imitation of the Prophct
	Solomon. But some people of the modern time, who want to make
	photography and carving of idols lawful in imitation of the West,
	took this verse of the Qur'an as an argument for themselves. They
	argue like this: &quot;When a Prophet of Allah has done this and
	Allah Himself has mentioned this act of the Prophet in His Book, and
	has expressed no disapproval of it either, it must be lawful . &quot;
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	argument of these followers of the West is wrong for two reasons.
	First, the word tamathil that has been used in the Qur'an, does not
	explicitly give the meaning of the human and animal pictures, but it
	applies to the pictures of lifeless things as well. Therefore, only
	on the basis of this word, it cannot be concluded that it is lawful
	to make the human and animal pictures according to the Qur'an.
	Secondly, it is established by a large number of the Ahadith, which
	have been reported through authentic chains of transmitters, and
	commonly reported by many authorities, that the Holy Prophet
	absolutely forbade the making and keeping of the pictures of the
	living things. In this connection, we reproduce below the authentic
	Traditions of the Holy, Prophet and the verdicts given by the
	eminent Companions:

	Habibah and Hadrat Umm Salamah had seen a church in Habash, which
	had pictures in it. When they mentioned this before the Holy
	Prophet, he said: &quot;The custom among those people was that when
	a pious man from among them died, they would build a house of
	worship at his grave and would make his pictures in it. On the Day
	of Resurrection, these people will be among the most wretched
	creatures in the sight of Allah.&quot; (Bukhari: Kitab as-Salat,'

	and level down every grave that he sees, and blot out every picture
	that he sees. A man said that he would go. So he went but came back
	without carrying out the task due to fear of the people of Madinah.
	Then Hadrat `Ali submitted that he would go, and the Holy Prophet
	allowed him to go. Hadrat `Ali went, then came back and said: I have
	demolished every idol and leveled down every grave and blotted out
	every picture. Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Now if any one
	made any of these things, he would be denying the teaching sent down
	on Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace).&quot; (Musnad Ahmad;

	'Abdullah bin `Umar says: Once Gabriel promised to pay the Holy

	Prophet felt troubled and came out of his house and met him. When he
	complained to him, he (Gabriel) replied: &quot;We do not enter a

	a/-Libas. Several Traditions on this subject have been related by
	Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da`ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Imam Malik
	and Imam Ahmad on the authority of several Companions). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	against these, there are some other Traditions which allow some
	exceptions regarding the pictures. For example, according to a
	tradition of Abu Talhah Ansari, it is permissible to hang the
	curtain of a cloth which has pictures embroidered on it. (Bukhari:
	Kitab al-Libas); and according to Hadrat 'A'ishah's tradition, when
	she tore a cloth having pictures on it and made a cushion from it to
	be spread on the floor, the Holy Prophet did not forbid it. (Muslim:
	Kitab al-Libas); and Salim bin `Abdullah bin `Umar's tradition that
	the prohibition is of the picture which is displayed and installed
	prominently and not of the one which is used as a carpet: (Musnad
	Ahmad). But none of these traditions contradicts the Traditions
	which have been cited above. None of these sanctions the making and
	painting of the pictures. They only tell that if a person has got a
	piece of cloth having pictures on it, how he should use it. In this
	regard, the tradition of Abu Talhah Ansari cannot at all be accepted
	because it contradicts many, other authentic Traditions in which the
	Holy Prophet not only forbade use of cloth having pictures on it as
	a curtain but even tore it into pieces. Moreover, Hadrat Abu Talhah
	Ansari's own practice that has been reported in Tirmidhi and
	Mu'watta', in this regard, was that he did not even like to use a
	piece of cloth which had pictures on it, as a carpet, not to speak
	of hanging it as a curtain. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the traditions related by Hadrat `A'ishah and Salim bin `Abdullah.
	they only permit that if a picture is not placed prominently out of
	respect and esteem but is used as a carpet disrespectfully and is
	trodden under the feet, it could be tolerable. After all, how can
	these Traditions be cited for obtaining sanction for the culture
	which regards the art of painting and portrait making and sculpture
	as an enviable achievement of the human civilization, and wants to
	popularize it among the Muslims? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The code
	of practice that the Holy Prophet left for his Ummah with regard to
	the pictures, Can be seen from the conduct and practice of the
	eminent Companions, which they adopted in this regard. The admitted
	principle of law in Islam is that the authentic and reliable Islamic
	Law is that which the Holy Prophet enjoined during the latter part
	of his life after it had passed through gradual and preliminary
	injunctions and exceptions. And after the Holy Prophet the eminent
	Companions' practice and persistence on a particular way is a proof
	that he left the Ummah on that way. Now Iet us sec how these holy

	making the pictures of a living thing is not only unlawful but
	strictly forbidden and a major sin, whether the maker has made it
	for a purpose where it would be held with contempt or for some other
	use and purpose. The making and painting of the picture anyway is
	unlawful, because it is an attempt to create like the creation of
	Allah. Likewise. the making of pictures whether in the cloth, or in
	the carpet, or nn a coin, or in a utensil, or in a wall, is in any
	case unlawful. However, making the pictures of something else, for
	instance, of a tree, etc., is not forbidden. Whether the picture
	casts a shadow or not is immaterial. The same is the opinion of Imam
	Malik, Sufyan Thauri, Imam Abu Hanifah, and other scholars. Qadi
	Iyad says that the dolls of girls are an exception, but Imam Malik;
	disapproved of even buying them.&quot; (`Umdat al-Qari vol. XXII p.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is

	of the pictures made by others, `Allama Ibn Hajar has cited the
	views of the jurists of Islam as follows: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Ibn
	'Arabi, the Malikite jurist, says that the consensus of opinion is
	that the picture that casts a shadow is unlawful, whether it is
	regarded with contempt or not. Only the dolls of girls are an
	exception .. .. Ibn 'Arab; also says that the picture which does not
	cast a shadow but which persists (as in the printed form, unlike the
	reflection of a mirror) is also unlawful, whether it is regarded
	with contempt or not. However, if its head is cut off, or its limbs
	or parts are separated, it may be used. ... Imam al-Harmayn has
	cited a verdict according to which a curtain or a cushion having
	pictures on it may be used, but the picture hung on the wall or
	ceiling is forbidden, for it would show respect and esteem for it,
	while the picture on the curtain or cushion, on the contrary, would
	be held with contempt. ... Ibn Abi Shaibah has related on the
	authority of 'Ikrimah that the scholars among the immediate
	followers of the Companions held the opinion that the picture's
	being in the carpet or cushion is disgraceful for it; they also
	opined that the picture hung prominently is unlawful, but the one
	trodden under the feet is permissible. The same opinion has been
	cited from Ibn Sirin, Salim bin 'Abdullah, 'Ikrimah bin Khalid and
	Said bin Jubair.&quot; (Fath al-Bari, vol. X, p. 300).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	details given above clearly show that the forbiddence of the
	pictures is not a controversial or doubtful matter in Islam, but it
	is an established article of the law according to the express
	instructions of the Holy Prophet, the practice of the Companions and
	the unanimous verdicts of the jurists of Islam, which cannot be
	changed by the hairsplitting of the people influenced by the alien
	cultures. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, certain other things should also be understood so that
	there remains no misunderstanding in this regard. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people try to make a distinction Between a photograph and a
	painting, whereas the Shari ah forbids the picture itself and not
	any process or method of making pictures. There is no difference
	between a photograph and a painting: they are both pictures.
	Whatever difference is there between them is due to the method of
	making them, and in this regard the Shari'ah injunctions make no
	difference between them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people give the argument that the picture was forbidden in Islam 'in
	order to put an end to idol-worship. As there is no such danger now,
	this injunction should be annulled. But this argument is absolutely
	wrong. In the first place, nowhere in the Traditions has it been
	said that the pictures have been made unlawful in order to avoid the
	danger of shirk and idol-worship. Secondly, the assertion that shirk
	and idol-worship have been eradicated from the world is also
	baseless. Today in the Indo-Pak sub-continent itself there are
	millions of idol worshipers and polytheists. Shirk is being
	practiced in different regions of the world in different ways. The
	Christian people of the Book also are worshiping the images and
	portraits of the Prophet Jesus and Mary and other saints; so much so
	that even a large number of the Muslims also are involved in the
	evil of worshiping others than God. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people say that only those pictures which are polytheistic in nature
	should be forbidden, i. e. , pictures and images of those persons
	who have been made gods. As for the other pictures and images there
	is no reason why they should be forbidden. But the people who argue
	like this, in fact, become their own law-givers instead of deriving
	law from the Commandments and instructions of the Law-Giver, They do
	not know that the picture does not become the cause of polytheism
	and idol-worship only but has become the cause of. many other
	mischiefs in the world, and is becoming so even today. The picture
	is one of those major means by which the aura of greatness of the
	kings, dictators and political leaders has been impressed upon the
	minds of the common people. The picture also has been used
	extensively for spreading obscenity and today this mischief has
	touched heights unknown to previous history. Pictures have also been
	used for sowing discord and hatred and for creating mischief between
	the nations and for misleading the masses in different ways.
	Therefore, the view that the Law-Giver forbade the picture only in
	order to eradicate idol-worship is basically wrong. The Law-Giver
	has absolutely forbidden pictures of the living things. If we are
	not our own law-givers but are the followers of the-Law-Giver, we
	should desist from this accordingly. It is not at all lawful for us
	that we should propose from ourselves a basis for a particular
	injunction and then, on the basis of it, should declare some
	pictures lawful and some as unlawful. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people refer to some apparently &quot;harmless' kinds of pictures
	and say that there could be no danger from these: they could not
	cause the mischiefs of shirk, obscenity, political propaganda or
	other evils; therefore, they should not be forbidden. Here again the
	people commit the same error: they first propose a cause and a basis
	for an injunction, and then argue that when the cause is not found
	in a particular forbidden thing, it should not be forbidden.
	Furthermore, these people also do not understand the rule of the
	Islamic Shari ah that it does not make vague and ambiguous
	boundaries between the lawful and the unlawful from which a man may
	not be able to judge when he is within the bounds and when he has
	crossed them; but it draws a clear line of demarcation which every
	person can see like the broad daylight. The demarcation in respect
	of the picture is absolutely clear: pictures of living things are
	unlawful and of the lifeless things lawful. This line of demarcation
	does not admit any ambiguity. The one who has to follow the
	injunctions can clearly know what is permissible for him and what is
	not. But, if some pictures of the living things had been declared
	lawful and some unlawful, no list of the two kinds of the pictures
	however extensive, would have made the boundary between the lawful
	and the unlawful clear, and the case of many pictures would still
	have remained ambiguous as to whether they were within the bounds of
	lawfulness or outside them. This is similar to the Islamic
	injunction about wine that one should completely abstain from it,
	and this marks a clear limit, Hut, if it had been said that one
	should abstain from such a quantity of wine as intoxicates, it would
	be impossible to demarcate between the lawful and the unlawful , and
	no one would have been able to decide what quantity of wine he could
	drink; and where he had to stop. (For a further discussion, see Rasa

	modern commentators have interpreted it as follows: As the Prophet
	Solomon's son, Rehoboam, was unworthy and given to luxurious living
	and surrounded by flatterers, he could not sustain the heavy burden
	of responsibility that fell on his shoulders after the death of his
	great father. A short time after his succession, the kingdom
	collapsed, and the frontier` tribes (i. e. , of the jinns) whom the
	Prophet Solomon had subdued by his mighty power, rebelled and broke
	away. But this interpretation does not at all conform to the words
	of the Qur'an. The scene depicted by the words of the Qur'an is
	somewhat like this: Death came to the Prophet Solomon in a state
	when he was standing or sitting with-the support of a staff. His
	body stood in place due to the staff, and the jinns continued to
	perform their duties and services, thinking that he was living. At
	last, when the wood-louse started eating away the staff and it
	became hollow from within, the Prophet Solomon's body fell down;
	then the jinns realized that he had died. After all, why should this
	clear and unambiguous description of the event be construed to mean
	that the wood-louse implied the unworthiness of the Prophet
	Solomon's son, and the staff implied his power and authority and the
	falling down of his body implied the disintegration of his kingdom?
	Had Allah meant to say all this, there was no dearth of the words in
	the vast Arabic language. The Qur'an, in fact, has nowhere used such
	enigmatic language. How could the common Arabs, who were its first
	addressees, have solved this riddle? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then, the
	most absurd part of this interpretation is that according to it the
	jinns imply the people of the frontier tribes whom the Prophet
	Solomon had subdued to perform certain services under him. The
	question is, which of these tribes had claimed to have the knowledge
	of the unseen, and whom did the mushriks regard as the knower of the
	unseen? A person who reads the last words of the verse with open
	eyes can himself see that jinn here necessarily implies a group of
	beings who either had themselves made a claim to have the knowledge
	of the unseen, or who, the people believed, had the knowledge of the
	unseen; and the secret of this group's being ignorant and unaware of
	the unseen became disclosed when they continued to serve the Prophet
	Solomon under the impression that he was living, whereas he had
	died. This statement of the Qur'an was enough to induce an honest
	person to revise his this opinion that the jinn imply the frontier
	tribes, but the people who feel shy of admitting the existence of
	the hidden creation called the jinn before the materialistic world
	stilt insist on this interpretation of theirs in spite of the plain
	meaning of the Qur'an.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">At

	is, Iblis did not have the power to have forcibly misled these
	people to the way of God's disobedience although they had wanted to
	adopt His obedience. Allah had only given him the power that he may
	seduce and mislead them and make all such people his followers, who
	may like to follow him of their own accord. And Iblis was provided
	these opportunities for seduction so that the believers of the

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In other
	words, this Divine statement makes the truth explicit that nothing
	in this world other than belief in the Hereafter can ensure man's
	adherence to the right way. If a man disbelieves that he is to be
	raised back to life after death and has to render an account of his
	deeds before his God, he will certainly be misled and go astray, for
	he will never be able to develop in himself the sense of
	.responsibility which alone can make him adhere to the right way.
	That is why the artifice of Satan by which he ensnares man is that
	he makes him heedless of the Hereafter. The one who escapes this
	satanic enticement can never agree that he should sacrifice the
	interests of his real everlasting life to the interests of the
	transient life of the world. On the contrary, the one who
	disbelieves in the Hereafter under the evil influence of Satan, or
	at least entertains doubts about it, can never be induced to
	withdraw from the cash bargain being made in this world only due to
	the apprehension that it might cause loss in some later life.
	Whoever has gone astray in the world, has gone astray only due to
	the denial of the Hereafter, or some suspicion about it; and whoever
	has adopted righteousness has done so because his righteous deeds
	have issued from his belief in the Hereafter. &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Since
	antiquity this Arabian nation has been well known to the rest of the
	world. Ur inscriptions of 2500 B.C. mention it by the name of Sabom.
	Then in the Babylonian and Assyrian inscriptions and also in the
	Bible it has been mentioned several times. (See, for instance,
	Psalms 72:15; Jeremiah 6: 20; Ezekiel 27:22, 38: 13; Job 6: 19). The
	Greek and Roman historians and the geographer Theo-phrastus (288
	B.C.) have mentioned it continuously for many centuries of the
	Christian era since before Christ. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Its home
	was the south-western corner of the Arabian peninsula, now called
	al-Yaman. Its rise to prominence started in 1100 B.C. In the time of
	the Prophets David and Solomon the Sabaeans had become world fatuous
	as a wealthy people. In the beginning they were a sun-worshiping
	nation. Then, when their queen affirmed faith at the hand of the
	Prophet Solomon (965-926 B.C.) probably most of them became Muslims.
	But then in some unknown later period they again began to worship
	gods and goddesses tike Almaqah (the moon-god), 'A thtar (Venus),
	Dhat Hamim, Dhat Bad'an (the sun-god), Harmatam or Harimat and many
	others. Almaqah was their chief deity, and the kings made claim to
	the people's obedience as representatives of this deity. Many
	inscriptions have been unearthed in the Yaman, which show that the
	whole land abounded in the temples of these gods, especially of
	Almaqah, and thanks giving services for them were held at every
	important event.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As a
	result of the modern archaeological researches about 3,000
	inscriptions have been discovered, which throw a good deal of light
	on the history of this nation. Besides these, if the information
	yielded by the Arabian traditionalists and the Roman and Greek
	historians is compiled, a detailed history of this nation can be
	prepared. According to this information the following are the
	important periods of its history: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	Pre-mid-seventh Century Period: In this period Mukarrib was the
	title of the Sabaean kings. Probably a synonym of Muqarrib, it
	signified that the kings regarded themselves as the link between men
	and gods; or, in other words, they were the priest-kings. Their
	capital was Sirwah, whose ruins are found at a day's journey to the
	west of Maa'rib, and are now called al-Kharibah. The foundations of
	the great Maa'rib dam were laid in this period: then the different
	kings extended it from time to time. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) 650
	B. C. to 115 B. C. : In this period the Sabaean kings discarded
	Mukarrib and adopted the title of Malik (king), which signified that
	theocracy was replaced by secular kingship. They left Sirwah and
	made Maa'rib their capital and extended it in every way. This place
	lay 3900 feet above the sea, and is some 60 miles east of San'a'.
	Even today its nuns bear evidence that it was once the centre of a
	highly civilized nation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) 115
	B. C. to 300 A.D. : In this period the Sabaean kingdom fell under
	the domination of the tribe of Himyar, a more numerous tribe of
	Saba. They discarded Maa'rib and made their central place, Raydan,
	their capital, which later became known as Zafar. Its nuns can still
	be seen on a circular hill near the modern city of Yarim. Close by
	it there resides a small tribe by the name of Hinmar, perhaps the
	remnant of the great nation which was once well known throughout the
	world for its glory and grandeur. In the same period the word
	Yamanat and Yamanat began to be used for the first time for a part
	of the kingdom, which gradually became Yaman and the name of the
	entire land, which extends from `Asir to Aden and from Bab al-Mandab
	to Hadramaut. During this very period the decline of the Sabaean
	began. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) 300
	A.D. to the rise, of Islam :This is the period of the Sabaea's
	destruction. They started fighting civil wars, which provided
	occasion for external intervention. This resulted in the decline in
	their trade and their agriculture and even loss of political
	freedom. Taking advantage of the internal conflicts between the
	Himyarites and other tribes, the Abyssinians occupied the Yaman and
	ruled it briefly from 340 A.D. to 378 A.D. Then, though political
	freedom was restored, breaches began to appear in the great dam of
	Maa'rib, which in 450 or 451 A.D. led to the catastrophe occasioned
	by the &quot;bursting of the dam&quot; as has been referred to in
	verse 16 above. Although after it till the time of Abraha the dam
	was extensively repaired, the population that had dispersed could
	not be brought back, nor could the ruined system of irrigation and
	agriculture be restored. In 523 A.D., dhu-Nuwas, the Jewish king of
	the Yaman, carried out the great massacre of the Christians of
	Najran, which has been referred to in the Qur'an under &quot;ashab
	al-ukhdud&quot; (LXXXV: 4). In retaliation, the Christian kingdom of
	Abyssinia invaded Yaman and occupied the whole land. Later the
	Abyssinian governor of Yaman, Abrahah, in a bid to put an end to the
	central position of the Ka`bah and to bring the whole of western
	Arabia into the sphere of the ByzantineAbyssinian influence invaded
	Makkah in 570 or 571 A.D., a few days 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">before
	the birth of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace).
	The Abyssinian army was completely destroyed as alluded to under
	ashab al-fil in the Qur'an. At last, in 575 A.D. Yaman fell to the
	Iranians; their rule came to an end in 628 A.D. when their governor
	Badhan embraced Islam. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Sabaeans owed their prosperity to two main factors: agriculture and
	commerce. They had developed their agriculture by means of a
	wonderful irrigation system unknown in the ancient world except in
	Babylon. There were no natural rivers in their land; in the rainy
	season small hill-torrents rose on which they had built dams every
	where in the country and collected water in small lakes from which
	they had taken out canals to water their lands. This had virtually
	turned the whole country into a vast garden as mentioned in the
	Qur'an. The largest reservoir was the lake which had been formed by
	the construction of a dam on the opening in the Jabal Balaq near
	Maa`rib. But when Allah caused His favours to be turned away from
	them, the great dam burst in the mid-fifth century A.D. and the
	resultant floods went on breaking one dam after the other on the
	way, destroying the entire irrigation system, which could never
	again be restored. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">For
	commerce the Sabaeans had been blessed by God with the most
	favorable geographical position of which they took full advantage.
	For more than a thousand years they monopolized the means of trade
	between the East and the West. On the one hand, they received silk
	from China, spices from Indonesia and Malabar, fabrics and swords
	from India, slaves, monkeys, ostrich feathers and ivory from East
	Africa at their ports, and on the other, they transported this
	merchandise to the Egyptian and Syrian marts, to be supplied onward
	to Rome and Greece. Besides, they themselves were great producers of
	frankincense and myrrh and other perfumes, which were in great
	demand in Egypt and Syria and in Rome and Greece. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Two great
	routes existed for this international trade: the sea route and the
	land route. The maritime trade remained in the Sabaeans' control for
	more than a thousand years for they alone knew the mysteries of the
	Red Sea monsoons, breakers and rocks and the anchorages, and no
	other nation could risk navigation through these dangerous waters.
	Through this maritime route they took their trade goods to the
	harbours of Jordan and Egypt. The land routes from Aden and
	Hadramaut joined at Ma'arib, from where a highway led to Petra
	through Makkah, Jeddah, Yathrib, AI-`Ula, Tabuk and Aylah, forking
	at the northern end to Egypt and Syria. Along this land route, a
	number of Sabaean colonies had been established right from the Yaman
	to the borders of Syria, as mentioned in the Qur'an, and trade
	caravans passed by these day and night. The signs of many of these
	colonies still exist on this route from which the Sabaean and the
	Himyarite inscriptions are being discovered. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After the
	first century after Christ Sabaean trade began w suffer a decline.
	When the Greek, and then the Roman, kingdoms were established in the
	Middle East, the citizens began complaining of the high prices that
	the Arabian traders were charging for the oriental goods because of
	their monopoly, and urged their governments to take the initiative
	to break their supremacy in the sea trade. Thus, in the beginning,
	Ptolemy II (985-246 B.C.), the Greek ruler of Egypt, reopened the
	Nile-Red Sea canal originally dug by Pharaoh Sesostris some
	seventeen centuries previously. Consequently, it was through this
	canal that the Egyptian fleet entered the Red Sea for the first
	time, but it could not succeed much against the Sabaeans. When Egypt
	fell to the Romans they brought a stronger merchant marine into the
	Red Sea and put a naval fleet at its back. The Sabaeans could not
	withstand this force. Consequently, the Romans set up their trade
	colonies at every seaport, arranged supplies for the ships and also
	stationed their military troops wherever possible. At last, the time
	came when Aden passed under the military occupation of the Romans.
	In this connection, the Roman and the Abyssinian kingdoms also
	entered secret pacts against the Sabaeans, which ultimately deprived
	this nation of its political freedom as well. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After
	losing control over maritime trade the Sabaeans were left with trade
	over the land route only, but many factors combined to gradually
	break its back too. First, the Nabataeans ousted them from all the
	colonies of the upper Hejaz and Jordan, from Petra to Al-`Ula. Then
	in 106 A.D. the Romans put an end to the Nabataean kingdom and
	captured all the Syrian and Jordanian territories up to the Hejaz.
	After this Abyssinia and Rome jointly tried to ruin the Sabaean
	trade completely by taking advantage of their internal conflicts.
	That is why the Abyssinians intervened in the Yaman again and again,
	till at last they brought the whole land under their occupation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus,
	Allah's wrath caused this nation to be toppled from the heights of
	glory and prosperity into oblivion from which they were never able
	to rise again. There was a time when the Greeks and the Romans felt
	tempted when they heard of the legendary wealth of this people.
	Strabo writes, &quot;The Sabaeans use gold and silver utensils and
	even the ceilings, walls and doors of their houses are bedecked with
	ivory, gold, silver and jewels.&quot; Pliny says, &quot;The whole
	wealth of Rome and Persia is flowing into Sabaean hands. They are
	the richest people of the world today, and their fertile land
	abounds in gardens, crops and cattle.&quot; Artemidorus says, &quot;These
	people roll in luxury. They burn cinnamon, sandalwood and other
	sweet smelling wood as fuel. &quot; Likewise, other Greek historians
	relate that the passengers passing by their shores can smell the
	perfumes of their land in the merchant ships at sea. For the first
	time in history they built a skyscraper, called the castle of
	Ghumdan, on the hill top in San`a'. This citadel, according to the
	Arab historians, had twenty stores, each story being 36 feet high.
	Thus did they prosper and enjoy life as long as Allah favored them
	with His bounties. At last, when they transgressed all limits in
	their ingratitude, the Almighty Allah also withdrew His attention,
	and they were so utterly destroyed as if they had never existed at
	all.

	Him and those who do not believe are getting their provisions.
	Neither is abundance of the provisions a proof that one is Allah's

	although wickedness and dishonesty are disliked by Allah. On the

	suffers losses and undergoes hardships although these qualities arc
	liked by Allah. Hence, the person who regards the material gains and
	benefits as the criterion for the good and evil is grossly mistaken.
	The real criterion is Allah's pleasure and approval which is
	attained through the moral qualities liked and approved by Him. With
	these qualities if a person gets -the worldly blessings as well it
	will certainly be Allah's bounty for which he should be grateful to
	Him. But if from the moral point of view a person is Allah's rebel

	a matter of fact, no one adopts shirk and atheism and denial of the
	Hereafter by conviction, nor can he, for conviction comes from
	knowledge. And no one has the knowledge that there is no God, or
	that many others have a share in Divine authority, or that there
	should be no Hereafter. Thus, whoever has adopted these beliefs in
	the world, has raised a structure on mere conjecture, which has no
	basis except doubt and suspicion, and this suspicion has led him to
	sheer error. Consequently, they doubted God's existence, they
	doubted the truth of Tauhid, they doubted the coming of the
	Hereafter; so much so that they made this doubt their faith and did
	not listen to the Prophets and expended and wasted their whole
	lifetime indulging in a wrong creed and way of life.&nbsp;
