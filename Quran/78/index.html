we have explained in the introduction to Surah Al-Mursalat, the theme

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Its
theme also is the same as of Surah Al-Mursalat, i. e. to affirm the
Resurrection and Hereafter, and to warn the people of the
consequences of acknowledging or disacknowledging it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) first started to preach Islam
in Makkah, his message consisted of three elements: (1) That none be
held as an associate with Allah in Godhead; (2) that Allah had
appointed him as His Messenger; (3) that this world will come to an
end one day and then another world will be established when all the
former and the latter generations will be resurrected with the same
bodies in which they lived and worked in the world; then they will be
called to account for their beliefs and deeds and those who emerge as
believing and righteous in this accountability will go to Paradise
and those who are proved to be disbelieving and wicked will live in
Hell for ever. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Of
these although the first thing was highly unpleasant for the people
of Makkah, yet in any case they were not disbelievers in the
existence of Allah. They believed in His Being the Supreme Sustainer,
Creator and Providence and also admitted that all those beings whom
they regarded as their deities, were themselves Allah's creatures.
Therefore, in this regard the only thing they disputed was whether
they had any share in the attributes and powers of Divinity and in
the Divine Being itself or not. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
for the second thing, the people of Makkah were not prepared to
accept it. However, what they could not possibly deny was that during
the 40 years life that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had
lived among them before his claim to Prophethood, they had never
found him a lying deceitful person or the one who would adopt
unlawful methods for selfish ends. They themselves admitted that he
was a man possessed of wisdom, righteousness and moral superiority.
Therefore, in spite of charging him with a thousand false
accusations, nothing to say of making others believe, they were
finding it difficult even for themselves to believe that although he
was an honest and upright man in every other affair and dealing of
life, yet, God forbid, a liar only in his claim to be a Prophet. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Thus,
the first two things were not in fact so perplexing for the people of
Makkah as the third thing. When this was presented before them, they
mocked it most of all, expressed unusual wonder at it, and regarding
it as remote from reason and impossible, started talking against it
as incredible, even inconceivable, in their assemblies. But in order
to bring them to the way of Islam it was absolutely essential that
the doctrine of the Hereafter should be instilled into their minds,
for without belief in this doctrine, it was not at all possible that
they could adopt a serious attitude with regard to the truth and
falsehood, could change their standard of values in respect of good
and evil, and giving up worship of the world, could be inclined to
follow the way that Islam urged them to follow. That is why in the
earliest Surahs revealed at Makkah the doctrine of the Hereafter has
been impressed and stressed more than anything else. However, the
arguments for it have been given in such a way that the doctrine of
the Oneness of God (</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Tauhid</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">)
also is impressed on the minds automatically. This also contains
brief arguments, here and there, to confirm the truth of the Holy
Messenger of Allah and the Qur'an. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
understanding well why the theme of the Hereafter has been so
frequently repeated in the Surahs of this period, let us now have a
look at the subject matter of this Surah. In it first of all,
allusion has been made to the common talk and the doubts that were
being expressed in every street of Makkah and in every assembly of
the people of Makkah on hearing the news about Resurrection. Then,
the deniers have been asked: &quot;Don't you see this earth which We
have spread as a carpet for you? Don't you see the high mountains
which we have so firmly placed in the earth?Don't you consider your
own selves how We have created you as pairs of men and women?Don't
you consider your sleep by which We make you seek a few hours rest
after every few hours labour and toil so as to keep you fit for work
in the world? Don't you see the alternation of the night and day
which We are so regularly perpetuating precisely according to your
needs and requirements?Don't you see the strongly fortified system of
the heavens above you? Don't you see the sun by means of which you
are receiving your light and heat? Don't you see the rains which fall
from the clouds and help produce corns and vegetables and luxuriant
gardens? Do these things only tell you that the power of the Almighty
Being Who has created them, will be unable to bring about
Resurrection and establish the Next World? Then, from the supreme
wisdom which is clearly working in this world around you, do you only
understand this that although each part of it and each function of it
is purposive, yet life is meaningless? Nothing could be more absurd
and meaningless that after appointing man to the office of foreman
and granting him vast powers of appropriation, in this workhouse,
when he leaves the world after fulfilling his role, he should be let
off without any accountability. He should neither be rewarded and
granted pension on satisfactory work, nor subjected to any
accountability and punishment on unsatisfactory performance of duty. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
giving these arguments it has been emphatically stated that the Day
of Judgment shall certainly come to pass on its appointed time. No
sooner is the Trumpet sounded than whatever is being foretold shall
appear before the eyes, and whether you believe in it today, or not,
at that time you will come out in your multitudes from wherever you
would be lying dead and buried to render your account. Your denial
cannot in any way avert this inevitable event. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
in vv. 21-30; it has been stated that every single misdeed of those
who do not expect any accountability to take place and have thus
belied Our Revelations, lies reckoned and recorded with Us, and Hell
is ever lying an ambush to punish them and punish them fully for all
their doings. Then, in vv. 31-36, the best rewards of those who lived
as responsible people in the world and have provided for their
Hereafter beforehand have been mentioned. They have been reassured
that they will not only be rewarded richly for their services but in
addition they will also be given sufficient gifts. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, the Divine Court in the Hereafter has been depicted,
making it plain that there will be no question of somebody's being
adamant in the matter of getting his followers and associates
forgiven, none will speak without leave, and leave will be granted on
the condition that intercession be made only for the one to whom
leave of intercession will have been given, and the intercessor will
say only what is right. Moreover, leave for intercession will be
given only for those who had acknowledged the Truth in the world but
were sinners; rebels of God and rejectors of the Truth will deserve
no intercession at all. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
discourse has been concluded with this warning: The Day the coming of
which is being foretold, shall certainly come to pass. Do not think
it is yet far off, it is close at hand. Now, whoever wills, let him
believe in it and take the way towards his Lord. But he who
disbelieves, in spite of the warning, &quot;will have all his deeds
placed before him: and he will exclaim regretfully: &quot;Oh, would
that I were not born in the world!&quot; At that time, his regrets
will be about the same world of which he is so enamored today! </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	Great News&quot;: the news of the Resurrection and Hereafter, which
	the people of Makkah heard with amazement, then raised questions and
	doubts about it in their assemblies. When they met each other they
	would ask: &quot;Did you ever hear that the dead will be resurrected
	to life? Is it credible that life will be infused once again into
	the bones which have decayed and become rotten? Does it stand to
	reason that the former and the latter generations will rise up and
	gather together at one place? Is it possible that these huge
	mountains which are so firmly set in the earth will fly about like
	flakes of wool? Can it so happen that the sun and the moon and the
	stars should be extinguished and the order and system of the world
	be overturned and upset? What has happened to him who was until
	yesterday a sane and wise man among us? Today he is giving us
	strange, impossible news. Where were this Hell and Heaven of which
	we had never heard from him before? where from have they appeared
	suddenly so that he has started depicting them so vividly before
	us?&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	meaning of fi-hi mukhtalifun also can be: &quot;As these people
	themselves are not agreed on any one view about the end of the
	world, they hold varying views about it.&quot; Some one has been
	influenced by the Christian belief and believes in the life after
	death but thinks that the second life would not be a physical but
	only a spiritual life. Another does not deny the Hereafter
	absolutely but doubts whether it was possible or not. The Qur'an
	relates the view of these very people when it says: &quot;We do only
	guess: we are not certain.&quot; (Al-Jathiyah: 32). And another
	plainly said: &quot;There is no other life than this present life,
	and we shall never be raised back to life after our death.&quot;
	(Al-An`am: 29). Then, there were some atheists, who said: &quot;Life
	is only this worldly life of ours. Here we shall die and live and
	nothing but the change of time destroys us.&quot; (Al-Jathiyah: 24).
	There were some others who were not atheistic but they regarded the
	second life as impossible. According to them it was beyond the power
	of God to raise the dead back to life. They said, &quot;Who will
	give life to these bones when they are rotten.&quot; (Ya Sin: 78).
	Their different views by themselves were a proof that they had no
	knowledge in this regard; they were only conjecturing and guessing.
	Had they any knowledge they would have agreed on one view. (For
	further explanation, see E.N. 6 of Surah Adh-Dhariyat).&nbsp;

	wisdom has placed the earth at the right distance from it, neither
	it is too hot for being close to it, nor too cold for being very far

	presenting a number of the signs and testimonies, one after the
	other, in these verses, the deniers of the Resurrection and
	Hereafter have been exhorted, so as to say: &quot;If you consider
	the earth and the mountains and your own creation, your sleep and
	wakefulness, and the system of the day and night intelligently, and
	consider the well-fortified system of the universe and the shining
	sun in the heavens, the rain falling from the clouds and the

	first, that all this could neither come into existence without a

	second, that in each of these great wisdom is working and nothing
	that happens here is purposeless. Now, only a foolish person could
	say that the Bring Who by His power has brought these things into
	existence, does not have the power to destroy them and create them
	once again in some other form, and this also could be said only by
	an unreasonable person that the Wise Bring Who has not done anything
	without purpose in this universe, has given to man in His world
	understanding and intelligence, discrimination between good and
	evil, freedom to obey or disobey, and powers of appropriation over

	time appearing continuously one after the other. From this word some
	people have tried to argue that there will be eternity in the life
	of Paradise but no eternity. in the life of Hell. For however long
	these ages may be, they will not be endless but will come to an end
	at some time. But this argument is wrong for two reasons. First,
	that lexically, the word haqab (sing. of ahqab) itself contains the
	meaning that one haqab should be closely followed by another haqab;
	therefore, ahqab will necessarily be used only for such periods of
	time as continue to appear successively one after the other and
	there should be no period which is not followed by another period.
	Second, that as a rule it is wrong to put a meaning on a verse of
	the Qur'an pertaining to a particular theme which clashes with other
	statements of the Qur'an pertaining to the same theme. At 34 places
	in the Qur'an the word khulud (eternity) has been used concerning
	the dwellers of Hell. At three places not only the word khulud has
	been used but the word abad an (for ever and ever) also has been
	added to it; and at one place it has been clearly stated: &quot;They
	will wish to get out of Hell but shall not be able to come out of it
	and theirs shall be an everlasting torment.&quot; (AI-Ma'idah: 37).
	At another place it has been said: &quot;Therein they shall abide
	for ever, as long as the earth and the heavens shall last, unless
	your Lord ordains otherwise.&quot; And the same thing has been said
	about the dwellers of Paradise too:&quot; &quot;They shall dwell in
	Paradise for ever, as long as the earth and the heavens shall last,
	unless your Lord wills something else.&quot; (Hud: 107-108). After
	these explanations, how can one argue, on the basis of the word
	abqab, that the stay of the rebels of God in Hell will not be

	major blessings of Paradise. Human ears there will remain secure
	against idle, false and indecent talk. There will be no nonsensical,

	others; nor will there be any use of abusive language, slandering;
	calumnies and false accusations which are so common in the world.

	given their due rewards which they will deserve for their good
	deeds, but over and above these they will be given additional and
	sufficient gifts and prizes as well. Contrary to this, in respect of
	the dwellers of Hell it has been said: &quot;They will be
	recompensed fully for their misdeeds.&quot; That is, they will
	neither be punished less than what they will deserve for their
	crimes nor more. This theme has been explained at length at many
	places in the Qur'an, for example, see Yunus: 26-27, An-Naml: 89-90,
	Al-Qasas: 84, Saba: 33-38, Al-Mu'min: 40.</P>

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	the intercessor will say only what is right and proper, and nothing
	derogatory, and the one for whom he is interceding should have at
	least acknowledged the Truth in the world. That is, he should only
	be a sinner, not an unbeliever. (For further explanation, see E.N.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote26sym" HREF="#sdfootnote26anc">26</A>Apparently,
	one might think that the people who were the audience of this verse
	died fourteen centuries ago, ,and even now it cannot be said how
	many hundreds or thousands or millions of years Resurrection will
	take to come. Then, in what sense has it been said: &quot;The
	torment of which you have been warned, has approached near at hand?&quot;
	And what is the meaning of saying in the beginning of the Surah:
	&quot;Soon they shall know?&quot; The answer is that man can have
	the feeling of time only until he is passing a physical life in the
	world within the bounds of space and time. After death when only the
	soul will survive, he will lose every feeling and consciousness of
	time, and on the Day of Resurrection when man will rise back to
	life, he will feel as though some one had aroused him from sleep
	suddenly. He will not at all be conscious that he has been
	resurrected after thousands of years. (For further explanation, see
	E.N. 26 of An-Nahl, E.N. 56 of Bani Isra'il, E.N. 80 of Ta Ha, E.N.
