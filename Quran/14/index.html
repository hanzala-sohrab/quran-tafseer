<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
appears from the tone of the Surah that it belongs to that group of
the Surahs which were revealed during the last stage of the Makkan
period. For instance, v. 13 (&quot;The disbelievers warned their
Messengers, 'you shall have to return to our community or we will
assuredly expel you from our land'&quot;) clearly indicates that the
persecution of the Muslims was at its worst at the time of the
revelation of this Surah, and the people of Makkah were bent on
expelling the Believers from there like the disbelievers of the
former Prophets. That is why in v. 14 they have been warned, &quot;We
will destroy these evil doers,&quot; and the Believers have been
comforted as were the believers before them, &quot;and after them
settle you in the land&quot; Likewise the stern warning contained in
the concluding portion (vv. 43-52 also confirms that the Surah
relates to the last stage of the Makkan Period.)</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
Surah is an admonition and a warning to the disbelievers who were
rejecting the Message of the Holy Prophet and devising cunning
schemes to defeat his Mission. But warning, reproof, censure and
reproach dominate admonition. This is because a good deal of
admonition had already been made in the preceding Surahs, but in
spite of this their obduracy, enmity, antagonism, mischief,
persecution etc. had rather increased. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Recall (the time) when Moses said to his people, &quot;Remember
Allah's favor on you: He delivered you from Pharaoh's people who
oppressed you with cruel afflictions: they slaughtered your sons and
let your females live. In this there was a hard trial for you from
your Lord. And remember also that your Lord forewarned, `If you be
grateful<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote11anc" HREF="#sdfootnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A>

should know that) My chastisement is severe indeed'!&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote12anc" HREF="#sdfootnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A>

dwellers of the earth know that Allah does not stand in need of any
of you, for He is All Sufficient and worthy of all praise by
Himself.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote13anc" HREF="#sdfootnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

The Messengers said, &quot;Do you have doubt about the existence of
Allah. Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth?<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote17anc" HREF="#sdfootnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
He calls you that He may forgive you your sins and give you respite
till your appointed term.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote18anc" HREF="#sdfootnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
They answered, &quot;You are no more than human beings like
ourselves.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote19anc" HREF="#sdfootnote19sym"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
You intend to debar us from the worship of the deities whom our
forefathers have been worshiping. Well, bring a clear Sign.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote20anc" HREF="#sdfootnote20sym"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
The Messengers replied, &quot;It is true that we are no more than
human beings like you, but Allah shows His favor to anyone of His
servants He pleases.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote21anc" HREF="#sdfootnote21sym"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
And it is not in our power to bring any Sign for you. A Sign can come
only by Allah's permission. And in Allah alone should the believers
put their trust. And why should we not put our trust in Allah when He
has guided us in the ways of our lives? We will bear with fortitude
your persecutions of us and the trustful should have trust in Allah
alone.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	a Messenger fails to bring a person to the Way. As regards the
	Divine Law, according to which Allah helps and permits a person to
	gain guidance, we learn from different passages of the Qur'an that
	Allah gives help only to that person who himself has a desire to get
	guidance: who frees himself from obduracy, obstinacy and prejudice:
	who is not a follower of his lust, nor a slave of his desires: who
