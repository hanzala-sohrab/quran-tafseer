Ishaq about the affirmation of the Faith by Hadrat Umar (may Allah be
pleased with him). It says that when Hadarat Umar entered his
sister's house, Surah Ta Ha was being recited. Hearing his voice the
people of the house hid the pages of the Qur'an. Hadrat Umar first
seized his brother-in-law and then his sister rose in defense of her
husband, he hit her also and wounded her on the head. When Umar saw
blood on his sister, he was sorry for what he had done, and said to
her: &quot;Show me the manuscript that you have concealed so that I
may see what it contains.&quot; The sister said: &quot;You are

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">and refutation of the Makkan
disbelievers' suspicions about the Qur'an. What they regarded as
utterly incredible was that Resurrection would ever take place, then
the entire system of the earth and heavens would be upset, and when
all the dead would be resurrected and called to account, after which
the righteous would be admitted to Paradise and the wicked cast into
Hell. They regarded all this as imaginary, which could not possibly
happen in actual fact. In answer to this, it was said: &quot;When the
inevitable event will take place, there will be none to belie its
happening, nor will anyone have the Power to avert it, nor prove it
to, be an unreal happening. At that time all peoples will be divided
into three classes: (1) The foremost in rank and position; (2) the
common righteous people and (3) those who denied the Hereafter and
persisted in disbelief and polytheism and major sins till the last.&quot;
How these three classes of the people will be rewarded and punished
has been described in detail in vv. 7-56. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Then,
in vv. 57-74 arguments have been given, one after the other, to prove
the truth of the two basic doctrines of Islam, which the disbelievers
were refusing to accept, viz. the doctrines of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Tauhid</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">and the Hereafter. In these arguments,
apart from every thing else that exists in the earth and heavens,
man's attention has been drawn to his own body and to the food that
he eats and to the water that he drinks and to the fire on which he
cooks his food, and he has been invited to ponder the question : What
right do you have to behave independently of, or serve any other
than, the God Whose creative power has brought you into being, and
Whose provisions sustain you And how can you entertain the idea that
after having once brought you into existence He has become so
helpless and powerless that He cannot recreate you once again even if
he wills to? </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
in vv. 75-82 their suspicions in respect of the Qur'an have been
refuted and they have been made to realize how fortunate they are
that instead of deriving any benefit from the great blessing that the
Qur'an is, they are treating it with scant attention and have set
only this share of theirs in it that they deny it. If one seriously
considers this matchless argument that has been presented in two
brief sentences about the truth of the Qur'an, one will find in it
the same kind of firm and stable system as exists among the stars and
planets of the Universe, and the same is the proof of the fact that
its Author is the same Being Who has created the Universe. Then the
disbelievers have been told that this Book is inscribed in that Writ
of Destiny which is beyond the reach of the creatures, as if to say
&quot;You think it is brought down by the devils to Muhammad (peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him), whereas none but the pure angels
has any access to the means by which it reaches Muhammad (peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him) from the well guarded Tablet.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, man has been warned, as if to say: &quot;You may brad and
boast as you like and may shut your eyes to the truths in your
arrogance of independence, but death is enough to open your eyes. At
death you become helpless: you cannot save your own parents; you
cannot save your children; you cannot save your religious guided and
beloved leaders. They all die in front of your vary eyes while you
look on helplessly. If there is no supreme power ruling over you, and
your this assumption is correct that you are all in all in the world,
and there is no God, then why don't you restore to the dying person
his soul?Just as you are helpless in this, so it is also beyond your
power to stop Allah from calling the people to account and mete out
rewards and punishments to them. You may or may not believe it, but
every dying person will surely see his own end after death. If he
belongs to those nearest to God, he will see the good end meant for
them if he be from among the righteous, he will see the end prepared
for the righteous; and if he be from among the deniers of the truth,
he will see the end destined for the criminals. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	Islam from the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon be Allah's peace and
	blessing). In it what seemed most astonishing and remote from reason
	to them was that the entire system of the earth and heavens would
	one day be overturned and then another world would be set up in
	which all the dead, of the former and the latter generations, would
	be resurrected. Bewildered they would ask: `This is just impossible

	How can one in his senses believe that there will be another life
	after death and there will be gardens of Paradise and the fire of
	Hell ?&quot; Such were the misgivings that were being expressed at

	as to how he himself has come into being, he can then neither have
	any doubts left about the doctrine of Tauhid presented by the Qur'an
	nor about its doctrine of the Hereafter. The process of man's own
	creation starts when the male has conveyed his sperm to the womb of
	the female. But the question is: Has the sperm by itself become
	endowed with the capability of producing a child, and necessarily a
	human child ? Or, has it been created by man himself, or, by another
	than God? And, is it in the power of the man, or of the woman, or of
	another agency in the world, to cause conception by this sperm?
	Then, who is responsible for the gradual formation and development
	of the fetus in the mother's womb, its shaping and molding into a
	unique child, the provision in a particular proportion of different
	mental and physical powers and qualities in each child, so that it
	develops into a unique person, except One God? Has another than God
	any role to play in this? Is it done by the parents themselves? Or,

	created in this very way? Or, by the sun and the moon and the stars,
	which arc themselves subject to a law? Or, by nature, which is
	devoid of any knowledge, wisdom, will and authority? Then, is it

	to be a boy or a girl? Whether it is to be beautiful or ugly, strong
	or weak, blind and deaf and a cripple or sound bodied, intelligent
	or stupid? Then, is it another than God who decides as to people of
	what caliber, good or and are to be created in a particular nation
	at a particular time, who would cause its rise or fall? If a person
	is not obdurate and stubborn, he will himself realize that no
	rational answer can be given to these questions on the basis of
	polytheism and atheism. Their rational answer is only one and it is
	this Man is wholly and entirely the creation of God; and when the

	microscopic germ. Then by their combination a tiny living cell comes
	into being, which is the starting-point of human life. This cell

	planning and skill. All this is the manifestation of Allah's power

	this sentence an important manifestation of Allah's power and wisdom
	has been pointed out. Among the wonderful properties that Allah has
	created in water one property also is that no matter what different
	substances are dissolved in water, when it changes into vapor under
	the effect of heat, it leaves behind all adulterations and
	evaporates only with its original and actual component elements. Had
	it not possessed this property the dissolved substances also would
	have evaporated along with the water vapors. In this case the vapors
	that arise from the oceans would have contained the sea salt, which
	would have made the soil saline and uncultivable wherever it rained.
	Then, neither could man have survived by drinking that water, nor
	could it help grow any vegetation. Now, can a man possessed of any
	common sense claim that this wise property in water has come about
	by itself under some blind and deaf law of nature? This
	characteristic by virtue of which sweet, pure water is distilled
	from saltish seas and falls as rain, and then serves as a source of
	water-supply and irrigation in the form of rivers, canals, springs
	and wells, provides a clear proof of the fact that the Providence
	has endowed water with this property thoughtfully and deliberately
	for the purpose that it may become a means of sustenance for His
	creatures. The creatures that could be sustained by salt water were
	created by Him in the sea and there they flourish and multiply. But
	the creatures that He created on the land and in the air, stood in
	need of sweet water for their sustenance and before making
	arrangement of the rainfall for its supply He created this property
	in water that at evaporation it should rise clear and free of

	asserted that he was being inspired with the Word by the jinn and

	out of its hearing.&quot; (vv. 210-212). The same theme has been

	take la in the sense of negation and interpret the verse to mean:
	&quot;None but the clean and pure touch this Book,&quot; they
	express the opinion that this negation is a prohibition in the same

	a brother of a Muslim: he does not treat him unjustly.&quot;
	Although in it, it has been said that a Muslim does not treat the

	touch this Book except the clean and purified people. &quot; For the
	addressees here are the disbelievers and they arc being told, as if
	to say: `This Book has been sent down by Allah Lord of the worlds.

	the Shari'ah injunction that no one should touch it without
	purification? The most that one could say in this regard is that

	yet the context points out that just as only the purified
	(mutahharin) can touch this Book in the presence of Allah, so in the

	contained this instruction as well.

	Tirmidhi).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	tradition of Ibn 'Umar in which he states: &quot;The Holy Messenger
	of Allah said: The menstruating woman and the one who is unclean on
	account of sexual intercourse should not read any portion of the
	Qur'an. &quot; (Abu Da'ud. Tirmidhi).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Salman,
	the Persian, saw no harm in reading the Qur'an without the
	ablutions, but even according to him touching the Qur'an with the
	hand in this state was not permissible. The same also was the view
	of Hadrat Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas and Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Umar. And
	Hadrat Hasan Basri and Ibrahim Nakha'i also regarded touching the
	Qur'an with the hand without the ablutions as disapproved,
	(AI-Jassas, Ahkam al-Qur an)). The same has been reported from
	'Ata', Ta'us, Sha'bi and Qasim bin Muhammad also. (Ibn Qudamah,
	Al-Mughni). However, according to all of them, reading the Qur'an
	without touching it with the hand, or reciting it from memory, was
	permissible even without the ablutions.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat

	Imam Zuhri regarded reading the Qur'an in the state of uncleanness
	due to sexual intercourse and menstruation and bleeding after
	childbirth as disapproved. But Ibn 'Abbas held the view, and the
	same also was his practice, that one could recite from memory the
	portion of the Qur'an that one usually recited as one's daily
	practice. When Hadrat Sa'id bin al-Musayyab and Sa`id bin Jubair
	were asked about their view in this regard, they replied: &quot;Is
	not the Qur'an preserved in the memory of such a person ? What then
	is the harm in reciting it ?&quot; (AI-Mughni, .9l-Muhalla by Ibn
	Hazm). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	following are the viewpoints of the jurists on this subject: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Hanafi viewpoint has been explained by Imam `Ala-'uddin al-Kashani
	in his Bada I as-Sana i, thus &quot;lust as it is not permissible to
	offer the Prayer without the ablutions, so also it is not
	permissible to touch the Qur'an without the ablutions, However, if
	the Qur'an is in a cast or a cover, it may be touched. &quot;
	According to some jurists, the case or cover implies the binding,
	and according to others, the bag or the envelope or the wrapper in
	which the Qur'an is kept and can also be taken out. Likewise, the
	books of the commentary also should not be touched without the
	ablutions, nor anything else in which a Qur'anic verse may have been
	written. However, the books of Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence) may be
	touched although preferably they too may not be touched without the
	ablutions, for they also contain Qur'anic verses as part of argument
	and reasoning. Some Hanafi jurists hold the opinion that only that
	part of the Qur'an where the Text may have been written should not
	be touched without the ablutions. As for the margins there is no
	harm in touching it, whether they are blank or contain notes on the
	Text. The .correct thing, however, is that the margins also are a
	part of the Book and touching them amounts to touching the Book. As
	for reading the Qur'an, it is permissible without the ablutions. &quot;
	In Fatawa 'Alamgiri children have been made an exception from this
	rule. The Qur'an can be given in the children's hand for teaching
	purposes whether they are in the state of ablutions or not.. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Shafi'i viewpoint has been stated by Imam Nawawi in Al-Minhaj, thus,
	&quot;As it is for the Prayer and the circumambulation of the
	Ka'bah, it is also forbidden to handle the Qur'an or to touch a leaf
	of it without the ablutions. Likewise, it is also forbidden w touch
	the binding of the Qur'an, and also a bag, or a bow containing the
	Qur'an, or a tablet on which a part of the Qur'an may have been
	written for instructional purposes. However, it is lawful to touch
	the baggage of a person containing the Qur'anic inscription. A child
	may touch the Qur'an without the ablutions, and a person without
	ablutions may turn over a leaf with a piece of wood, or something
	else, if he wants to read the Qur'an. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Maliki position as stated in Al-Fiqh 'alal-Madhahib al- Arbah is:
	They concur with the other jurists in this that the state of
	ablutions is a prerequisite for touching the Qur'an, but in the
	matter of imparting instruction in the Qur'an they make both the
	teacher and the taught an exception from the rule, and allow even a
	menstruating woman to touch the Qur'an if she is engaged in learning
	or teaching it. Ibn Qadamah has cited in Al-Mughni this saying of
	Imam Malik: Although reading the Qur'an in the state of uncleanness
	due to sexual intercourse is forbidden, the woman who is discharging
	the menses is permitted to read it, for she would forget her
	recitations if prohibited from reading the Qur'an for along time.
	The Hanbali viewpoint as stated by Ibn Qadamah is as follows: In the
	state of uncleanness due to sexual intercourse and menstruation and
	bleeding after childbirth it is not permissible to read the Qur'an
	or any complete verse of it. However, it is permissible to recite
	bismillah, al-hamdu-lillah, etc. for although these also are parts
	of one or the other verse, their recitation does not amount to
	recitation of the Qur'an. As for handling the Qur'an, it is not
	permissible in any case without the ablutions. However, one is not
	forbidden to touch a letter, or a book of Fiqh, or some other
	writing containing a Qur'anic verse. Likewise, one may handle even
	without the ablutions, something that contains the Qur'an. The state
	of ablutions is also no pre-requisite for .handling the books of
	exegesis. Furthermore, if a person who is not in the state of
	ablutions is required to handle the Qur'an under an immediate need,
	he may do so after purification with the dust (tayammum). &quot;
	AI-Fiqh `alal-Madhahib al- `Arabah contains this ruling also of the
	Hanbali Fiqh: It is not right for the children to handle the Qur'an
	without ablutions even when receiving instruction in it, and it is
	the duty of their guardians to make them perform the ablutions
	before they give the Qur'an to them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Zahiri viewpoint is that reading the Qur'an and handling it is
	permissible under all conditions, whether one is without the
	ablutions, or unclean due to sexual intercourse, or even if the
	woman is menstruating. Ibn Hazm has discussed this question fully in
	Al-Muhalla (vol. 1, pp. 77-84) and given arguments for the validity
	of this viewpoint and has concluded that none of the conditions laid
	down by the jurists for reading the Qur'an and handling it, is
	supported by the Qur'an and the Sunnah. &nbsp;

	-yal-a na in sajdah. (Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Ibn Majah, Ibn
	Hibban, Hakim). This show that even the most minor details of the

	for the Prayer are derived from the allusions given in the Qur'an. &nbsp;
