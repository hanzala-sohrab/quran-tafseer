<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the first seven verses, the system of winds has been presented as an
evidence of the truth that the Resurrection which is being foretold
by the Qur'an and the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace
and blessings) must come to pass. The reasoning is that the power of
All-Mighty Allah Who established this wonderful system on the earth,
cannot be helpless in bringing about the Resurrection, and the
express wisdom which underlies this system bears full evidence that
the Hereafter must appear, for no act of an All-Wise Creator can be
vain and purposeless, and if there was no Hereafter, it would mean
that the whole of one's life was useless and absurd. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
people of Makkah repeatedly asked, &quot;Bring about the Resurrection
with which you threaten us; only then shall we believe in it.&quot;In
vv. 8-l5, their demand has been answered, saying:&quot;Resurrection
is no sport or fun so that whenever a jester should ask for it, it
should be brought forth immediately. It is indeed the Day of Judgment
to settle the account of all mankind and of all its individuals. For
it Allah has fixed a specific time it will take place at its own
time, and when it takes place with all its dreads and horrors, it
will confound those who are demanding it for fun today. Then their
cases will be decided only on the evidence of those Messengers whom
these deniers of the truth are repudiating with impunity. Then they
will themselves realize how they themselves are responsible for their
dooms </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 16-28 arguments have been given continuously for the occurrence
and necessity of the Resurrection and Hereafter. In these it has been
stated that man's own history, his own birth, and the structure of
the earth on which he lives, bear the testimony that the coming of
Resurrection and the establishment of the Hereafter are possible as
well as the demand of Allah Almighty's wisdom. History tells us that
the nations which denied the Hereafter ultimately became corrupted
and met with destruction. This means that the Hereafter is a truth
which if denied and contradicted by a nation by its conduct and
attitude, will cause it to meet the same doom, which is met by a
blind man who bushes headlong into an approaching train. And it also
means that in the kingdom of the universe only physical laws are not
at work but a moral law also is working in it, under which in this
very world the process of retribution is operating. But since in the
present life of the world retribution is not taking place in its
complete and perfect form, the moral law of the universe necessarily
demands that there should come a time when it should take its full
course and all those good works and evil deeds, which could not be
rewarded here, or which escaped their due punishment should be fully
rewarded and punished. For this it is inevitable that there should be
a second life after death. If man only considers how he takes his
birth in the world, his intellect, provided it is sound intellect,
cannot deny that for the God Who began his creation from an
insignificant sperm drop and developed him into a perfect man, it
certainly possible to create the same man once again. After death the
particles of man's body do not disappear but continue to exist on the
same earth on which he lived his whole life. It is from the resources
and treasures of this very earth that he is made and nourished and
then into the same treasures of the earth he is deposited. The God
who caused him to emerge from the treasures of the earth, in the
first instance, can also cause him to re-emerge from the same
treasures after he has been restored to them at death. If one only
considers the powers of Allah, one cannot deny that He can do this;
and if one considers the wisdom of Allah, one also cannot deny that
it is certainly the very demand of His wisdom to call man to account
for the right and wrong use of the powers that He has granted him on
the earth; it would rather be against wisdom to let him off without
rendering an account. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

in vv. 28-40, the fate of the deniers of the Hereafter has been
depicted, and in vv. 41-45 of those who affirming faith in it in
their worldly life, endeavored to improve their Hereafter, and
abstained from the evils of disbelief and thought, morality and deed,
conduct and character which might be helpful in man's worldly life,
but are certainly ruinous for his life hereafter. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>That
	is, sometimes the failure of winds causes the people to be alarmed
	at the prospect of a famine, and they turn to Allah to repent of
	their sins: sometimes they bring a lot of rain and the people turn
	to Allah in gratitude; and sometimes their blowing violently causes
	dread in the hearts and the people turn to Allah from fear of
	destruction. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In these
	verses initially the order of rain-bringing winds has been stated,
	which is thus: first, winds start blowing in succession; then they
	assume the proportions of a storm; then they raise the clouds and
	spread them; then they split and separate them. After this, instead
	of making mention of the rainfall, it is said that the winds infuse
	the hearts with the remembrance of Allah, as an excuse or as a
	warning. That is, it is an occasion when either because of fear man
	is compelled to remember Allah, or else he confesses his errors and
	invokes Allah to protect and save him from ruin and bless him with
	rain. If it has not rained for a long time, and the people are
	thirsty for rain, even the most hardened disbeliever sometimes
	begins to remember God when he. sees the winds blowing and the
	clouds advancing. The drought's being mild and severe makes the
	difference. In case the drought is mild, the common man who is not
	far from Allah, will remember Him, but others will offer scientific
	explanations, saying that there was no cause for anxiety: it did not
	rain because of such and such a cause and it would be
	weak-mindedness to start praying to God on such an ordinary thing.
	However, if the drought is unusually prolonged, and the whole
	country is faced with a calamitous situation, even the confirmed
	disbelievers begin to remember God. If they feel shy to use their
	tongue, in their hearts they feel penitent on their wrongdoing and
	ingratitude and pray to God to cause rain throughout the country
	from the winds which are raising the clouds. This is infusion of
	God's remembrance in the hearts as an excuse. As for its infusion as
	a warning, it happens when the wind develops into a cyclone and
	destroys settlement after settlement or it rains so heavily as to
	cause a deluge, In such a state even a confirmed atheist starts
	imploring God out of awe for Him, and then all scientific
	explanations of the cyclone or deluge evaporate from his mind. Thus,
	after describing the blowing of winds in their succession to say
	that they infuse the hearts with Allah's remembrance as an excuse or
	as a warning, is meant to impress the truth that the system working
	in the world keeps on reminding man that everything on the earth has
	not been placed under his control but there is a Supreme Power above
	him, which rules his destiny. That Power is so supreme and mighty
	that it can use the elements for the sustenance and nourishment of
	man when it so wills and can use the same elements for his
	destruction when it so wills. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After
	this the same system of winds has been proffered as an argument to
	prove that the Resurrection which is being promised to man, must
	come to pass. Now, let us see how this system testifies to this
	truth. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Man
	generally is perplexed in the case of Resurrection and the Hereafter
	at two questions. First: is the occurrence of Resurrection possible?
	Second: what is its need and necessity? And then being perplexed at
	these questions, he starts entertaining doubts whether it will at
	all occur or not, or whether it was only a figment of the
	imagination. In this connection, the Qur'an has at some places
	reasoned out and proved its possibility, its necessity and
	occurrence from the system of the universe, and at others adopted
	another mode of reasoning: oaths have been sworn by some of the
	countless signs of God's Kingdom and it has been asserted that it
	shall surely come to pass. This mode of reasoning contains arguments
	for its possibility as well as arguments for its necessity and
	arguments for its occurrence. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here,
	adopting the same mode of reasoning only the system of the
	circulation of winds and rainfall has been presented as a sign of
	the truth that it is a regular system, which has been established by
	the design of an All-Wise, All-Mighty Sovereign; it is not a chance
	occurrence, as a result of which a system might have been generated
	in the atmosphere of the earth that vapors should arise from the
	seas, winds should carry them and gather them into clouds, then
	split and separate them into pieces and transport them to different
	parts of the earth and then should cause them to fall as rain. This
	system has not been devised accidentally by some blind and deaf
	Nature, but it is a well-considered and well-designed plan, which is
	functioning regularly according to a law. That is why it never so
	happens that the heat of the sun should produce ice on the surface
	of the sea instead of vapors, but the sun always raises only vapors
	from the sea. It never so happens that the monsoons should blow in
	the reverse order and suppress vapors into the sea but they always
	raise them up into the atmosphere. It never so happens that the
	formation of clouds should cease, or the winds should stop to carry
	them to dry lands or the falling of rain on the earth should
	discontinue. The same law has been at work since millions and
	millions of years under which this system is functioning. Had it not
	been so our coming into existence on the earth and survival here
	would not be possible. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	system one fords a clear purpose and the working of regular law. One
	can clearly see that on the earth the life of man, animal and
	vegetation deeply relates to the winds and rainfall, and this
	arrangement testifies that water has been provided to bring animate
	life into existence and keep it alive precisely according to their
	requirements and a law. This purpose and regularity is not found
	only in this aspect but in the entire system of the universe, and
	man's whole scientific progress is based on it. About every thing
	man tries to find out what is its purpose and on what principle it
	works Then as he goes on gaining insight into the purposes of the
	creation of different things and the principles on which they work,
	he goes on devising new and ever new methods of their use and making
	new inventions for the progress of his civilization. Had there been
	no such concept in the mind of man naturally that the world is a
	meaningful world and everything in it is working on a principle, he
	would never have entertained the question about anything as to what
	was its purpose and how it could be put to use. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now, when
	this world and everything in it has meaning, and if there is a law
	working in this world and in everything it contains, and if it has
	been functioning with the same purpose and regularity since millions
	and millions of years, then a stubborn person only could refuse to
	accept that an all-knowing, All-Mighty God has made it, and about
	that God it would be foolish to assume that although He could make
	and cause it to function but cannot break it, and after breaking it,
	cannot reconstruct it in any other form if He so wills, The concept
	about matter that it is imperishable was the chief support of the
	ignorant atheist of the past, but the progress of knowledge has
	proved it also false. Now it is an acknowledged scientific fact that
	matter can change into energy and energy into matter. Therefore, it
	is perfectly according to knowledge and reason that this material
	world will last only as long as the Living and Eternal God sustains
	it. As soon as He wills to change it into energy, He can change it
	by a simple Command and His one Command is enough to re-create it
	into any other material form and shape He wills. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This much
	then about the possibility of the Resurrection, which cannot now be
	rejected by any scientific and rational argument. As for the
	question that it must take place so that man is rewarded for his
	good works and punished for his evil deeds, the person who
	acknowledges man's moral responsibility and also believes that
	rewarding the good services and punishing the crimes is the
	necessary demand of this moral responsibility, cannot but admit that
	there must be the Hereafter. There is no law or government in the
	world, which can punish every crime and reward every good act. To
	say that the prick of the conscience is a sufficient punishment for
	the culprit and the satisfaction of the conscience is sufficient
	reward for the doer of good is no more than meaningless
	philosophizing. The question is: How and when did the conscience of
	the person who killed an innocent man and then himself died in an
	accident immediately after it reprove him? And when did the
	conscience of the man who went to fight for the sake of truth and
	justice and fell a victim to a bomb blast suddenly, have the
	satisfaction that he had laid down his life for a good cause? Thus,
	the truth is that the pretenses invented to avoid the belief in the
	Hereafter are all meaningless. Man's intellect wants, his nature
	requires, that there should be justice, but in the present life of
	the world it is not possible to have full and perfect justice.
	Justice can be had only in the Hereafter and only under the judgment
	and command of the All-Knowing, Omnipotent God. Denial of the
	necessity of the Hereafter is, in fact, denial of the necessity of
	justice. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Intellect
	can go only so far as to convince man that the Hereafter is possible
	and it should come about. As for the truth that it will surely come
	about, the &quot;knowledge&quot; of it can be obtained only through
	Revelation, and Revelation has given us the news that &quot;that
	which you are being promised must happen&quot;. We cannot attain
	this knowledge by intellectual reasoning; however, we can attain the
	certainty of its being true on the basis that the thing of which we
	are being informed by Revelation is both possible and necessary.&nbsp;

	an oath has been sworn by five things on the inevitability of the
	Resurrection: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	&quot;Those which are sent forth in succession, or for a good

	&quot;those which split and separate;&quot; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5)
	&quot;those which inspire the remembrance.&quot; As these words only
	describe the characteristics and it has not been specified what
	thing or things they qualify, this has given rise to a difference of
	opinion among the commentators as to whether these are the qualities
	of one particular thing or of different things and what the thing or
	things are. One group of them says that all the five qualify the
	winds; the second group says that all the five imply the angels; the
	third group says that the first three imply the winds and the
	remaining two the angels; the fourth says that the first two imply
	the winds and the other three the angels; another group has opined
	that the first quality implies the angels of mercy, the second the
	angels of punishment and the remaining three imply the verses of the
	Qur'an. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In our
	opinion, the first thing worthy of consideration is that when five
	characteristic have been mentioned continuously in one and the same
	context and there is no indication to show as to what has been
	qualified up to a certain point and where from has the qualification
	of another thing begun, it cannot be correct, on the basis of a
	baseless conjecture, to understand that in these verses oaths have
	been sworn by two or three different things. Rather in this case the
	continuity of the subject by itself requires that the whole passage
	be regarded as related to the characteristics of one and the same
	thing. Secondly, wherever in the Qur'an an oath bas been sworn by a
	certain thing or, things in order to convince the doubters or
	deniers of an unseen truth, there the oath stands for an argument or
	reasoning which is meant to tell that the thing or things point to
	the truth's being right and correct. For this purpose obviously it
	cannot be correct to present one imperceptible thing as an argument
	for another imperceptible thing; for, only a perceptible thing can
	be presented as an argument for an imperceptible thing. Hence in our
	opinion the correct explanation is that it implies the winds and the
	explanation of the people who interpret the five things to mean the
	angels cannot; be acceptable, for the angels are as imperceptible as
	is the occurrence of the Resurrection. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now, let
	us consider as to how these different states of winds point to the
	occurrence of the Resurrection. One of the most important factor
	which has made animal and vegetable life possible on the earth is
	the air. The relationship its qualities bear with every kind of life
	testify that there is an all-powerful, All-Wise Creator, Who willed
	to create life on this earth and for this purpose created here a
	thing whose qualities exactly and precisely correspond to the
	requirements of the existence of living beings. Then, He did not
	only wrap up the earth in the air and left it alone, but by His
	power and wisdom characterized this air with countless different
	states, which are being regulated since millions and millions of
	years in such a way that they cause the change of seasons and
	weather sometimes it is close and sometimes a soft breeze blows
	sometimes it is hot and sometimes cold; sometimes it brings clouds
	and sometimes it drives away clouds; sometimes it causes pleasant
	gusts to blow and sometimes disastrous windstorms; sometimes it
	brings beneficial rains and sometimes there is drought; in short,
	there are different 'kinds of winds which blow in their own time,
	and every kind serves one or the other purpose. This arrangement is
	the proof of a dominant Power, for which neither it can be
	impossible to bring life into existence, nor to obliterate it, nor
	to re-create it after having annihilated it. Likewise, this
	arrangement is also a proof of a supreme wisdom about which only a
	foolish man could think that all this was being done for fun,
	without any higher object in view. As against this wonderful system
	man is so helpless that he can neither cause a favorable wind to
	blow for himself, nor can prevent a disastrous cyclone from blowing
	on himself. However shameless, obstinate and stubborn he may be, the
	wind does at one time or another remind him that a Mighty Sovereign
	is ruling over him, Who can turn this principal means of his life
	into a cause of blessing for him or into a cause of ruin for him
	whenever He so likes, and man does not have the power to prevent or
	avert any of His decisions. (For further explanation, see E.N. 7 of
	Al-Jathiyah, E.N.'s 1 to 4 of Adh-Dhariyat).

	is yet another argument for the possibility and reasonableness of
	the Hereafter. It is this very earth which since millions and
	millions of years has been sustaining and providing for countless
	different kinds of creatures. Every kind of vegetation and every
	kind of animal and man are living on it, To meet the requirements of
	all immeasurable treasures of provisions of different kinds are
	corning out of its belly. Then it is on this very earth that
	countless members of all kinds of creatures die every day, but there
	exists a wonderful arrangement in that the dead bodies of all
	creatures are deposited in the same earth, and it again becomes
	ready for sustaining life and providing home to the new members of
	every species. This earth has not been shaped like a smooth-surfaced
	ball either, but here and there on it there have been set high
	mountains and mountain-ranges, which play an important role in
	causing the change of seasons and rainfall, the birth of rivers
	creation of fertile valleys, growth of trees which supply timber,
	and provisions of a variety of minerals and stones. Then in the
	interior of this very earth, sweet water has been stored and on its
	surface rivers of sweet water have been arranged and from the saline
	waters of the sea also vapors of pure water are raised and caused to
	fall as rain from the sky. Is not all this an argument to prove that
	an All-Powerful Sovereign has created all this and He is not only
	All-Powerful but AII-Knowing and All-Wise as well'? Now, if this
	earth has been thus equipped and provisioned only by His power and
	wisdom, why should an intelligent man trod it difficult to
	understand that the same Sovereign by His power can wind up this
	world and create another world on a new pattern, and the demand of
	His wisdom is that he should create another world after it so that
	He may call man to account for the deeds he has done in this world?&nbsp;
