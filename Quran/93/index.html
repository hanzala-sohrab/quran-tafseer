subject matter clearly indicates that it belongs to the earliest
period at Makkah. Traditions also show that the revelations were
suspended for a time, which caused the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
Allah's peace) to be deeply distressed and grieved. On this account
he felt very anxious that perhaps he had committed some error because
of which his Lord had become angry with him and had forsaken him.
Thereupon he was given the consolation that revelation had not been
stopped because of some displeasure but this was necessitated by the
same expediency as underlies the peace and stillness of the night
after the bright day, as if to say: &quot;If you had continuously
been exposed to the intensely bright light of Revelation (</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Wahi</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">)
your nerves could not have endured it. Therefore, an interval was
given in order to afford you peace and tranquility.&quot; This state
was experienced by the Holy Prophet in the initial stage of the
Prophethood when he was not yet accustomed to hear the intensity of
Revelation. On this basis, observance of a pause in between was
necessary. This we have already explained in the introduction to
Surah Al Muddaththir; and in E. N. 5 of Surah Al-Muzzammil also we
have explained what great burden of the coming down of Revelation he
had to bear. Later, when the Holy Prophet developed the power to bear
this burden, there was no longer any need for long gaps. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Its
theme is to console the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and its
object to remove his anxiety and distress, which he had been caused
by the suspension of Revelation. First of all, swearing an oath by
the bright morning and the stillness of night, he has been reassured,
so as to say: &quot;Your Lord has not at all forsaken you, nor is he
displeased with you.&quot; Then, he has been given the good news that
the hardships that he was experiencing in the initial stage of his
mission, would not last long, for every later period of life for him
would be better than the former period, and before long Allah would
bless him so abundantly that he would be well pleased. This is one of
the express prophecies of the Quran, which proved literally true,
afterwards, whereas when this prophecy was made there seemed not to
be the remotest chance that the helpless and powerless man who had
come out to wage a war against the ignorance and paganism of the
entire nation, would ever achieve such wonderful success. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

addressing His Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) Allah says:&quot;O
My dear Prophet, what has caused you the anxiety and distress that
your Lord has forsaken you, and that We are displeased with you?
Whereas the fact is that We have been good to you with kindness after
kindness ever since the day of your birth. You were born an orphan,
We made the best arrangement for your upbringing and care: you were
unaware of the Way, We showed you the Way; you were indigent, We made
you rich. All this shows that you have been favored by Us from the
very beginning and Our grace and bounty has been constantly focused
on you.&quot;Here, one should also keep in view vv. 37-42 of Surah Ta
Ha, where Allah, while sending the Prophet Moses to confront a tyrant
like Pharaoh, encouraged and consoled him, saying: &quot;We have been
looking after you with kindness ever since your birth; therefore, you
should be satisfied that you will not be left alone in this dreadful

<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>Traditions
	show that Revelations to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had
	remained suspended. for some period of time. Different traditions
	have mentioned different durations of this period. Ibn Juraij has
	mentioned it to be 12 days, Kalbi 15 days, Ibn 'Abbas 25 days, and
	Suddi and Muqatil have stated that it extended to 40 days. In any
	case the period was so long that it made the Holy Prophet (upon whom
	be peace) sorrowful, and the opponents also had the opportunity to
	taunt him. For whenever a new Surah came down, the Holy Prophet
	would recite it before the people. Therefore, when he did not recite
	any new Revelation to them for quite some days, the opponents
	thought that the fountainhead from where the revelation came, had
	dried up. Jundub bin 'Abdullah al-Bajali has related that when
	Gabriel (peace he on him) stopped coming, the pagans started saying
	that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) had been
	forsaken by his Lord. (Ibn Jarir, Tabarani, 'Abd bin Humaid, Sa'id
	bin Mansur, Ibn Marduyah). Other traditions show that Umm Jamil,
	wife of Abu Lahab, who was an aunt of the Holy Prophet and whose
	house adjoined his, said to him: &quot;It appears your satan has
	forsaken you.&quot; `Aufi and Ibn Jarir have related, on the
	authority of Ibn `Abbas, that when Gabriel did not visit him for
	several days, the Holy Prophet became anxious and distressed, and
	the pagans began to say that his Lord had become angry with him and
	had forsaken him. In the mursal traditions of Qatadah and Dahhak
	almost the same theme has been expressed. The Holy Prophet's extreme
	grief and anguish in this condition has also been referred to in
	several traditions. And this was natural. The apparent indifference
	on the part of the beloved, the apparent deprivation of the contact
	with the source of power, which was his chief support, in the
	soul-destroying conflict between belief and unbelief, and above all,
	the taunts and jeers of the enemy, when all these things combined
	they must have caused great anguish to the Holy Prophet, and he must
	be thinking that because of some error that he might have committed
	his Lord had become displeased with him and had forsaken and left
	him to fight the battle between truth and falsehood alone. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This was
	the state when this Surah was sent down to console the Holy Prophet.
	In it, swearing an oath by the light of the day and the peacefulness
	of the night, he has been told: &quot;Your Lord has neither forsaken
	you, nor is He displeased with you.&quot; The relevance of the oath
	by these two things to the theme is: &quot;Just as brightening up of
	the day and spreading of the night with darkness and stillness is
	not for the reason that Allah is pleased with the people during the
	day and displeased with them during the night but both states are
	based on supreme wisdom and expedience, so sending down of
	revelation to you at one-time and suspending it at another time,
	also is based on wisdom and expedience; it has nothing to do with
	Allah's being pleased with you when He sends down revelation and his
	being displeased with you when He suspends it. Besides, another
	relevance of the oath to the subject is that if man is constantly
	exposed to the light of days it wearies him; so, it is necessary
	that night should fall after the day has remained bright for a
	certain period so that man may have rest and peace in it. Likewise,
	if you are constantly exposed to the light of revelation, your
	nerves would not stand it. Therefore, fatrah (break or gap in the
	revelation) also has been provided by Allah on account of expedience
	so that the effects of the strain of revelation that you have to
	bear pass away and complete peace is restored to you. In other
	words, rising of the sun of -revelation is analogous to the bright
	day and the period of the fatrah to the stillness and peace of the
	night. &quot;&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>This
	good news was given by Allah to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) in a state when he had only a handful of Muslims with him,
	the entire nation was hostile and there was no remote chance of
	success even. The candle of Islam was flickering only in Makkah and
	storms were brewing all around to blow it out. At that juncture
	Allah said to His Prophet &quot;Do not at all grieve at the
	hardships of the initial stage: every later period of life will be
	better for you than the former period. Your power and glory, your
	honor and prestige, will go on enhancing and your influence will go
	on spreading. This promise is not only confined to the world, but it
	also includes the promise that the rank and. position you will be
	granted in the Hereafter will be far higher and nobler than the rank
	and position you attain in the world. &quot; Tabarani in A wsat and
	Baihaqi in Ad-dala il have related, on the authority of Ibn `Abbas
	.that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;All the victories which would be
	attained by my Ummah after me, were presented before me. This
	pleased me much. Then, Allah sent down this Word, saying: 'The
	Hereafter is fat better for you than the world'.&quot;&nbsp;

	when your Lord will bless you with so much that you will be well

	Holy Prophet and all Arabia, from the southern coasts to the Syrian
	frontiers of the Byzantine empire and the Iraqi frontiers of the
	Persian empire in the north, and from the Persian Gulf in the east
	to the Red Sea in the west, carne under his control. For the first
	time in the history of Arabia this land became subject to one law
	and rule. Whichever power clashed with it was doomed to destruction.
	The slogan La ilaha ill-allah-u Muhammad ur-Rasul-Allah reverberated
	throughout the land where the polytheists and the followers of the
	earlier scriptures had tried their utmost to keep their false creeds
	and slogans aloft till the last. The people not only bowed their
	heads in obedience, their hearts also were conquered, and their
	.beliefs, morals and acts were revolutionized. There is no precedent
	in human history that nation sunk in paganism might have completely
	changed in only 33 years. Then the movement started by the Holy
	Prophet gathered such power that it spread over a large part of
	Asia, Africa and Europe and its influence reached every nook and
	corner of the world. This much Allah gave His Messenger in the
	world, the glory and extent of what he will give him in the
	Hereafter cannot be imagined.&quot; (Also see E.N. 112 of Surah Ta

	passed away three months before his birth; thus he was an orphan at
	birth. But Allah did not leave him without support even for a day.
	Up to six years of age his mother nourished and looked after him.
	After her death, his grandfather took him and brought him up with

	still another meaning is of being lost and astray. The tree also is
	daallah which stands alone and lonely in the desert; the word dalal
	is also used for a thing which is wasting in unfavorable and
	uncongenial condition and climate, and also for heedlessness, of
	which there is an example in the Qur'an itself: La yadillu Rabbi wa
	la yansa:. &quot;My Lord is neither heedless nor He forgets.&quot;
	('Ta Ha: 52). Out of these different meanings. The first meaning
	does not apply here, for in the historical accounts of the Holy
	Prophet's life, from childhood till just before Prophethood, there
	is no trace that he ever might have been involved in idolatry,
	polytheism or atheism, or in any of the acts, customs and practices
	of paganism prevalent among his people. Therefore, inevitably wa wa.
	jadaka daallan cannot mean that Allah had found him erring and
	astray in respect of creed or deed. The other meanings, however, can
	be applicable here in one or other aspect, and possibly all are
	applicable in their own particular aspect. Before Prophethood the
	Holy Prophet was certainly a believer in the existence of Allah and
	His Unity, and his life was free from sin and reflected excellent
	morals, yet he was unaware of true Faith, its principles and
	injunctions, as it has been pointed out in the Qur'an: &quot;You did
	not know at all what was the Book and what was the Faith.&quot;
	(Ash-Shura: 52). This verse may also mean that the Holy Prophet was
	lost in a society, engrossed in ignorance, and his personality as a
	guide and leader was not in anyway prominent before Prophethood. It
	may as well mean that in the desert of ignorance, he was standing
	like a lonely tree, which had the capability to bear fruit and turn
	the whole desert into a garden, but this capability was not being
	put to any use before Prophethood. It may also imply that the
	extraordinary powers that Allah had blessed him with, were going
	waste in the unfavorable environment of ignorance. Dalal can also be
	taken in the meaning of heedlessness, so as to say: &quot;You were
	heedless of the truths and sciences of which Allah made you aware
	after Prophethood.&quot; This thing also has been referred to in the
	Qur'an itself: &quot;Though before this you were utterly unaware of
	these truths.&quot; (Yusuf: 3). (Also see AI-Baqarah: 282,
	Ash-Shu'ara: 20).&nbsp;

	a time came when the wealthiest lady among the Quraish, Hadrat

	he took charge of all her trade and business. Thus, he not only

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If sa'il
	is taken in the sense of a needy person, who asks for help, it would
	mean that if you can,, you should help him; if you cannot you should
	excuse yourself politely, but should never scold him. In this sense
	the instruction corresponds to Allah's this favor: &quot;You were
	poor, then Allah enriched you. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And if
	sa'il is taken in the sense of the one who inquires, i. e. asks for
	enlightenment on a religious matter or injunction, it would mean
	that even if such a person be extremely ignorant and ill-mannered
	and might put the question, or present his problem, impolitely, you
	should in any case answer him politely and kindly, and should not
	turn him away like the rude people proud of their knowledge. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	meaning, the instruction corresponds to Allah's this favor: &quot;You
	were unaware of the Way, then he guided you.&quot; Hadrat
	Abud-Darda`, Hasan Basri, Sufyan Thauri and some other scholars have
	preferred this second meaning, for in view of the order and sequence
	this instruction corresponds to: wa wajadaka daalllan fa hada.&nbsp;</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote11">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote11sym" HREF="#sdfootnote11anc">11</A>The
	word ni 'mat . (bounty) is general, which also implies those
	bounties, which Allah had bestowed on His Messenger until the
	revelation of this Surah as well as those which He bestowed on him
	afterwards according to the promise made in this Surah, which He
	fulfilled completely. Then, it is enjoined:&quot;O Prophet, mention
	and proclaim every bounty that Allah has favored you with.&quot;
	Now, obviously, there can be different forms and ways of mentioning
	and proclaiming the bounties and every bounty in view of its nature,
	requires a special form or its mention and proclamation. As a whole,
	the way of proclaiming the bounties is that Allah be thanked with
	the tongue and the truth be acknowledged that all the bounties
	received are only due to His grace and favor and none is the result
	of any personal excellence and merit on his part. The blessing of
	Prophethood can be proclaimed by preaching and conveying its message
	in the best way possible. The blessing of the Qur'an can be
	proclaimed by publicizing it widely and impressing its teachings on
	the peoples minds as far as one can. The blessing of Allah's
	guidance can be proclaimed by showing the right way to the people
	who are gone astray and by enduring patiently all the bitternesses
	and hardships of the way. The favor that Allah has done of helping
	during orphanhood, demands that the orphans be treated well. The
	favor that Allah did of enriching after poverty requires that
	Allah's needy servants be helped and supported. In short, this is a
	very comprehensive instruction which Allah gave His Messenger (upon
	whom be His peace) in this brief sentence after having described His
	bounties and blessings.</P>
