<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
tradition indicates that on the occasion of the incident that bas
been related in Surah Al Ahqaf(vv. 29- 32) of the jinn's hearing the
Qur'an from the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him) he was reciting Surah Ar Rahman in the Prayer. This happened in
the 10th year of the Prophethood when the Holy Prophet had halted at
Makkah on his way back from Ta'if. Although in some other traditions
it has been reported that the Holy Prophet did not know then that the
jinn were hearing him recite the Qur'an, but afterwards Allah had
informed him of this, it is not unreasonable to suppose that just as
Allah had informed him of the jinn's hearing the Qur'an so also Allah
Himself might have told him as to what answer they were giving on
hearing Surah Ar Rahman. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These
traditions only indicate that Surah Ar Rahman had been revealed even
before Surahs Al-Hijr and Al-Ahqaf. Besides, we come across another
tradition which shows that it is one of those Surahs which were the
earliest Revelations at Makkah. Ibn Ishaq has related this on the
authority of Hadrat Urwah bin Zubair: The Companions one day said to
one another: &quot;The Quraish have never heard any one recite the
Qur'an publicly to them, and who would read out the Divine Word aloud
to them Hadrat Abdullah bin Masud said that he would. The Companions
expressed the apprehension that he might be subjected to a harsh
treatment and said that it should better be done by a person of a
powerful family, who would protect him if the Quraish tried to
subject him to violence. Hadrat Abdullah said: 'Let me alone : my
Protector is Allah.' So early next morning he went to the Ka'bah
while the Quraish chiefs were sitting in their respective
conferences. Hadrat Abdullah arrived at the Maqam (station of
Abraham) and began to recite Surah Ar- Rahman raising his voice as he
did so. The Quraish first tried for a while to understand what he was
saying. Then,when they realized that it was the Word that Muhammad
(peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was representing as the
Word of God, they fell upon him and began to hit him in the face. But
Hadrat Abdullah was not deterred : he continued to receive the slaps
and to read the Qur'an as long as he could, At last, when he returned
with a swollen face, the Companions said that they apprehended the
same. He replied: 'God's enemies were never so light for me as they
were today. If you say I'll recite the Qur'an to them again
tomorrow.' They all said, 'No, you have done enough; you have made
them listen to what they didn't want to bear.'&quot; (Ibn Hisham,
vol. 1, p. 336). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
is the only Surah of the Qur'an in which besides men the jinn also,
who are the other creation of the earth endowed with freedom of will
and action, have been directly addressed, and both men and jinn have
been made to realize the wonders of Allah's power, His countless
blessings, their own helplessness and accountability before Him, and
have been warned of the evil consequences of His disobedience and
made aware of the best results of His obedience. Although at several
other places in the Qur'an there are clear pointers to show that like
the men the jinn too are a creation who have been endowed with
freedom of will and action and are accountable, who have been granted
the freedom of belief and unbelief, of obedience and disobedience,
and among them too there are the believers and the unbelievers, the
obedient and the rebellious, as among human beings, and among them
too there exist such groups as have believed in the Prophets sent by
God and in the Divine Books, this Surah clearly points out that the
message of the Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him) and the Qur'an is meant both for men and for jinn and that his
Prophethood is not restricted to human beings alone. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

verse 13 onward both the men and the jinn have been addressed and one

	for the people were hearing it from the tongue of the Prophet
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings). Therefore, the

	the discourse with this sentence is meant,,first of all, to tell

	Furthermore, there is another object also to which the word Rahman
	(Merciful) is pointing. If the purpose was only to say that that
	teaching is from Allah, and not the production of the Prophet's
	mind, there was no need to use an attribute of Allah instead of His
	proper name, acid for that purpose any attribute from among the
	Divine attributes could have been adopted, But when, instead of
	saying that Allah, or the Creator, or the Providence, has taught
	this, it was said: 'The Merciful (Ar-Rahman) has taught this
	Qur'an,' it by itself gave the meaning that the revelation of the
	Qur'an for the guidance of mankind was nothing but Allah's mercy and
	grace, As He is most kind and Merciful to His creation, He did not
	like that He should leave them wandering in the darkness, and His
	mercy demanded that He should send down this Quran to bless them

	other words, as Allah is the Creator of man, and it is the Creator's
	responsibility to provide guidance to His creation and show it the
	way by following which it may fulfill the object of its erection,
	the revelation of this Qur'anic teaching from Allah is not only the
	demand of Allah's mercifulness but also the necessary and natural
	demand of His being the Creator. Who else would provide guidance to
	the creation if not the Creator ? And if the Creator did not provide
	guidance, who else could? And what greater defect could there be for
	a creator that he should not teach his creation the method of
	fulfilling the object, for which it has been created? Thus, in fact,
	the arrangement and' provision of the teaching for man by Allah is
	not anything strange; it would be strange if no such arrangement had
	been made at all, Allah has not just left alone whatever He has
	created in the Universe, but has given it the most appropriate
	structure by which it may play its role in the system of nature and
	has taught it the method of playing that role effectively and
	successfully. Thus, each single hair and each single cell of man's
	own body has been born with the knowledge of how it has to carry out
	the task in the human body for which it has been created, Then,
	after all how could man himself remain deprived and independent of
	his Creator's teaching and guidance? This theme has been presented
	in the Qur'an at different places in different ways, In Surah
	Al-lail; 12, it has been said; &quot;Indeed, it is for Us to toll
	the Way&quot; in surah An-Nahl: 9, it is said Allah has taken upon
	Himself to show the Right Way, when there exist crooked ways too:12
	In surah Ta Ha (vv: 47-50) it has been stated that when the Pharaoh
	heard the prophetic message from the Prophet Moses and asked who was
	his Lord who had sent him as a Messenger to him, the Prophet
	replied: &quot;Our Lord is He Who has given a distinctive form to
	everything and then guided it aright. &quot; That is, He has taught
	it the method by which it could carry out and fulfill the object of
	its creation in the system of existence. This is the reasoning by
	which an unbiased mind is satisfied that the coming of the Prophets
	and the Books from Allah for the instruction of man is the very
	demand of nature. &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>One
	meaning of the word bayan, as used in the original, is the
	expressing of one's own mind, i e. speaking and expressing one's
	thoughts and intentions. Its other meaning is to make distinction
	between things, which here signifies the distinction between good
	and evil, virtue and vice. According to those two meanings this
	brief sentence completes the above reasoning. Speech is the
	distinctive quality which distinguishes man from the animals and
	other earthly creatures, It is not merely the power of speech, but
	there are working behind It the faculties of reasoning and
	intellect, understanding and discernment, will and Judgment, and
	other mental powers without which man's power of speech could not
	operate at all. Therefore, speech is in fact an express symbol of
	man's being an intelligent being who has been endowed with freedom
	and authority, and when Allah has blessed man with this distinctive
	quality, evidently the nature of instruction for him also cannot be
	the same a: would be suitable for the guidance of other creatures.
	Likewise, another distinctive quality of vital Importance in man is
	that Allah has placed in him moral sense by virtue of which he can
	naturally distinguish between good and evil, truth and falsehood,
	Justice and injustice, right and wrong, and this intuition and sense
	does not leave him even when he degrades himself to the lowest state
	of error and ignorance. The Inevitable demand of these two
	distinctive qualities is that the method of instruction for man's
	conscious and voluntary life should be different from the innate,
	natural mode of instruction under which the fish has been taught to
	swim, the bird to fly, and the eye in the human body itself to wink
	and see, the ear to hear and the stomach to digest, Man in this
	sphere of his life himself recognizes the means like the teacher,
	the book, the school, the verbal and written instruction and
	reasoning and discussion as the modes of instruction, and does not
	regard the innate knowledge and intelligence as enough. Why should
	It then appear arrange that for fulfilling the responsibility that
	falls upon the Creator of educating man, He has made the Messenger
	and the Book the means of his education and instruction ? The mode
	of education has to suit the nature of the creation, And very
	rationally so; The &quot;Qur'an&quot; alone cart be the means of
	educating the creation that has been taught 'bayan&quot;(speech) and
	not my other means that might salt the creatures which have not been
	taught the speech.</P>

	for the plants and creepers which do not have a stem, e.g.
	vegetable, melons, water melons, etc. The commentators have disputed
	the sense in which this word has been used here. Ibn 'Abbas, Sa'id
	bin Jubair, Suddi, and Sufyan Thauri have taken it in the meaning of
	stemless vegetation, for just after it the word ash-shajar (the

	contrary, Mujahid, Qatadah and Hasan Basri have expressed the
	opinion that an-najm here does not imply the plants of the earth,

	(pl. of najm) cannot be taken in any other meaning than of the

	wal jibalu wash-shajaru wad-da wabbu wa kathir-um-min-annasi. . . .

	been reported from Ibn 'Abbas, Qatadah and Hasan Basri. The major

	statement that the jinn on hearing this verse being recited would
	respond to it, saying La bi-shai in-min-ni maatika Rabba-na
	nukadhdhib: &quot;O our Lord, we do not deny any of Your blessings.&quot;

	meaning of this word is power and wonders of power, or excellent
	manifestations of power. Ibn Jarir Tabari has reported that Ibn Zaid
	took the words fa-bi-ayyi alaa i Rabbi kuma in the meaning of fa
	bi-ayyi qudrat-Allah. Ibn Jarir himself has taken alaa' in the
	meaning of power and might in his commentary of vv. 37-38. Imam Razi

	same place, but due to limitations of translation we have had to
	adopt only one meaning. For example, in this verse after making
	mention of the creation of the earth and of making the best
	arrangements for the supply of provisions to the creatures, it has
	been said: 'Which of the alaa' of your Lord will you deny?&quot;
	Here, alaa' has not been used in the meaning of the blessings only
	but also in the meaning of the manifestations of Allah Almighty's
	power and His praiseworthy attributes. It is a wonder of His might
	that He fashioned this earth in such a marvelous manner that

	qualities that He not only created these creatures but also made
	arrangements for their sustenance and the supply of provisions for
	them; and the arrangements also so perfect that their food is not
	only nutritious but also pleasing to the taste and sight. In this
	connection, reference has been made to only one excellence of Allah
	Almighty's workmanship for the sake of example, viz., the creation
	of the date-palm fruit in sheaths. Keeping this one example in view
	one may consider what excellences of art have been devised and shown

	words in the original are: mim-marij-im-min-nar. Nar signifies fire
	of a special nature and not the fire which is produced by burning
	wood or coal, and marij means a pure, smokeless flame. The verse
	means that just as the first man was created out of earth, then
	passing through various stages of creation, the clay model adopted
	the shape of a living man of flesh and blood, and then his progeny
	spread by means of the sperm-drop, so was the first jinn created
	from a pure flame of fire, or a fire free of smoke, and then the
	species of jinn spread from his progeny. The position of the first
	jinn among the jinn is the same as of Adam (peace be upon him) among
	human beings. After taking the shape of a living man, the body of
	Adam and the human beings born of his progeny retained no
	relationship with the dust from which. they were originally created.
	Though even now our body is entirely a compound of the earthly
	substances, these substances have taken the from of flesh and blood
	and after being made a living body it has become quite a different
	thing from a mere lump of clay. The same also is true of the jinn.
	Their being also is essentially fiery. But just as we are not a mere
	lump of earth, so also they arc not a mere flame of fire. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	verse proves two things. First, that the jinn are not simply spirit,
	but are material beings of a special nature, but since they have
	been composed of pure fiery substances, they remain invisible to
	human beings who have bean created of earthly substances. The same
	has been referred to in this verse: &quot;Satan and his party see
	you from where you cannot see them.&quot; (AI-A`raf: 27) Likewise,
	the jinn's being fast-moving, their adopting different shapes and
	forms easily and their penetrating into different places
	imperceptibly where things made of earthly substances cannot
	penetrate, or if they do, their penetration becomes perceptible, all
	these things are possible and understandable only because they are
	essentially a fiery creation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	thing that we come to know from this verse is that the jinn are not
	only a creation of a wholly different nature from human beings, but
	the substance of their creation also is absolutely different from
	that of man, animal, vegetable and solid matter. This verse
	explicitly points out the error of the viewpoint of those people who
	regard the jinn as a kind of human beings. According to their
	interpretation, the meaning of creating man of the dust and the jinn
	of the fire is to describe the difference of the temperamental
	nature of the two kinds of the people; one kind of them are humble
	by nature, and they are men in the true sense, and the other kind of
	the people are wicked by nature and fiery in temper, who may better
	be called devils. This is, however, no commentary of the Qur'an but
	its distortion. In E.N. 14 above we have shown in detail how the
	Qur'an itself has fully described the meaning of creating man from
	the earth. After reading all these details, can a reasonable person
	understand that the object of all this is only to define the
	humility of the good men ? Moreover, how can a sound-minded person
	understand that the meaning of creating man of rotten, dry clay and
	the jinn of the flame of pure fire is the difference of the separate
	moral characteristics of the two individuals or groups with
	different temperaments belonging to the same human species? (For
	further explanation, see E.N. 53 of Surah Adh-Dhariyat). &nbsp;

	in view of the context, It is more appropriate to translate alaa' as
	'wonders of power&quot;, but in this the aspect of the blessing is
	also present. Just as it is a wonderful manifestation of Allah's
	power to have brought into existence marvelous creatures like man
	from the dust and the jinn from the flame of fire, so for both these
	creatures this is a great blessing also that Allah not only granted
	them a body but gave each such a structure and endowed each with
	such powers and capabilities that they became able to perform unique
	works in the world. Though we do not know much about the jinn, man
	is present before us. Had he been given the body of a fish or a bird
	or a monkey along with the human brain, he could not have with that
	body used the mental powers to any advantage. Then, is it not a
	supreme blessing of Allah that He blessed man with the most suitable
	body also, so that he may exploit the mental powers granted to him
	efficiently? Consider the hands, the feet, the eyes, the ears, the
	tongue and the erect stature as against the intellect and reason,
	and the capabilities of workmanship and artistic skill, and one will
	feel that the Creator has provided a deep relationship and harmony
	between them without which the human body would have remained
	useless. Then, the same thing points out Allah's praiseworthy
	qualities too. How could the men and jinn of such quality and rank
	be brought into existence without knowledge, wisdom, mercy and a
	profound creative power ? For such miracles of creation cannot be
	performed by accidents and automatic blind and deaf laws of nature.

	the time the sun rises in one hemisphere of the earth, it sets in
	the other hemisphere, thus producing two easts and two wests of the
	earth. There arc several meanings of calling Allah Lord of both the
	Easts and both the Wests. Firstly, that it is by His Command that
	the system of the rising and setting of the sun and their changing

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	'Neither you are immortal nor the provisions that you are enjoying
	in this world everlasting. Immortal and Everlasting is the Being of
	the High and Supreme God alone Whose greatness this Universe
	testifies, and by Whose grace and kindness you have been favored

	'None of those whom you have set up as deities and removers of
	hardships and fulfiller: of needs, apart from Allah, whether they
	are angels or prophets or the moon and the sun, or some other
	creation, can fulfill any of your needs. These helpless creatures

	are not able to remove their own hardships how will they remove your
	hardships? Whatever Is happening In this limitless Universe, from

	thinking that his false godhead is everlasting, disavows Lord of the
	world's glory and majesty by his conduct, if not by his tongue. His
	pride and arrogance by itself is a denial of Allah Almighty's

	promote the truth or falsehood, spreads evil or good: He will
	neither punish the oppressor nor redress the grievances of the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On
	account of this difference in meaning, one probable meaning of these

	meaning is that these two gardens will be inferior in quality and
	rank to both the first mentioned gardens: that is, the first two
	gardens will either be situated at a higher level than these two, or
	the first two gardens will be of a superior kind and these two of an
	inferior kind as compared to them. If the first probability is
	adopted, it would mean that these two additional gardens also will
	be for those dwellers of Paradise, who have been mentioned above,
	And in case the second probability is adopted, the meaning would be
	that the first two gardens will be for 'those nearest to Allah&quot;,
	and these two for &quot;the people of the right hand.&quot; This
	second probability is strengthened by the two kinds of the righteous
	inert as mentioned in Surah AI-Waqi'ah. First, the foremost, who
	have also been called the &quot;muqarrabun &quot;; second, the
	people of the right hand, who have also been entitled &quot;ashab
	al-maimanah &quot;; and for both these separate qualities of the two
	kinds of the gardens have been mentioned. Furthermore, this
	probability is also strengthened by the Hadith which Abu Bakr has
	related on the authority of his father, Hadrat Abu Musa al-Ash'ari,
	In this he says: The Holy Prophet said: 'Two jannats (gardens) will
	be for the foremost among the righteous (or the muqarrabin), in
	which the utensils and articles of decoration will be of gold, and
	two jannats for the followers (or the ashab al gamin), in which

<DIV ID="sdfootnote51">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote51sym" HREF="#sdfootnote51anc">51</A>For
	the explanation of her see E. N's 28, 29 of Surah As-Saaffat and
	E.N. 42 of Surah Ad-Dukhan the tents probably will be similar to
	those pitched for the nobles and rich people in the public parks.
	Most probably the wives of the dwellers of Paradise will live with
	them in their palaces and in their parks there will be tents pitched
	here and there in which there will be the houris to entertain them.
	Our this presumption is based on this that in the foregoing verses
	beautiful and chase wives have been mentioned; now, here, mention of
	the houris signifies that they will be a different kind of women
	from the wives. This presumption is further strengthened by the
	Hadith which Hadrat Umm Salamah has reported. She says: 'I asked: O
	messenger of Allah, who are better: the women of the world or the
	houris! The Holy Prophet replied: The women of the world are
	superior to the houris in the same way as the outer layer of a
	garment is superior to its lining. I asked: On what grounds ? he
	replied: On the ground that the women have offered their Prayers,
	observed their Fasts, and performed other devotions.&quot;
	(Tabarani). This shows that the wives of the dwellers of Paradise
	will be the women who affirmed the faith in the world and left the
	world while they practiced good and right. They will enter Paradise
	in consequence of their faith and good deeds, and will deserve the
	blessings of Paradise on merit. They would either become the wives
	of their previous husbands of their own free will and choice. if
	they too happened to be dwellers of Paradise, or Allah will wed them
	to some other dweller of Paradise, if the two would like to live
	together as husband and wife. As for the houris they will not be
	entitled to dwell in Paradise as a result of any righteous deed of
	their own, but Allah will create them as young, beautiful women and
	bestow them also as a blessing among the other blessings on the
	dwellers of Paradise so that they may enjoy their companionship. But
	they will not in any case be creatures of the kind of the jinn and
	fairies, for man cannot cohabit with a kind other than his own.
	Therefore, most probably these would be those innocent girls who
	died immature, and whose parents did not deserve Paradise so that
	they could be admitted to Paradise with them as the children of
	their righteous torrents.&nbsp;

	So much so that in their idiom the man who possessed extraordinary
	abilities and who performed wonderful works was also called abqari
	The English word genius also is spoken in the same sense and is also
	derived from genii which is a synonym of jinn. That is why the word
