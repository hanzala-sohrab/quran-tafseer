happened some time after the battle of the Trench (Shawwal, 5 A. H.).

Muslims have been strictly warned that it is contrary to their
profession of the Faith that they should still persist in the
practices of ignorance after they have accepted Islam, that they
should break the bounds set by Allah, or refuse to abide by them, or
that they should make their own rules and regulations contradictory
to them. For this there is not only the punishment of disgrace and
humiliation in the world but in the Hereafter too there will be
strict accountability for it. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 7-10 the hypocrites have been taken to task for their secret
whisperings and consultations by which they conspired and intrigued
against the &quot;Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace and
blessings), and because of their hidden malice and grudge greeted
him, like the Jews, in a manner as to wish him ill instead of well.
In this connection, the Muslims have been consoled, as if to say:
&quot;These whisperings of the hypocrites can do no harm to you;
therefore, you should go on doing your duty with full trust in
Allah&quot;. Besides, they have also been taught this moral
lesson:&quot;The true believers, when they talk secretly together, do
not talk of sin and transgression and disobedience to the Messenger
if they have to talk secretly together they should talk of goodness
and piety.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 11-13 the Muslims have been taught certain manners of social
behavior and given instructions to eradicate certain social evils
which were prevalent among the people then as they are today. If some
people are sitting in an assembly, and more people arrive, they do
not show even the courtesy as to squeeze in so as to make room for
others, with the result that the new-comers have to keep standing, or
to sit in the door-way, or to go back, or seeing that there is enough
room yet start jumping over the people's heads to find room for
themselves. This often used to be experienced in the Holy Prophet's
assemblies. Therefore, Allah gave the instruction, as if to say:&quot;Do
not behave selfishly and narrow mindedly in your assemblies but do
accommodate the new-comers also with an open heart.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Likewise,
another vice found among the people is that when they go on a visit
to somebody (an important person, in particular), they prolong their
sitting and do not at all mind that encroaching upon his time unduly
would cause him hardship. Then, if he tells them to leave, they mind
it; if he himself rises up from their assembly, they complain of his
lack of manners; if he tells them indirectly that he has some other
business also to attend to, for which he needs time, they turn a deaf
ear to his request. The Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)
himself also had to experience such misconduct of the people, who in
their earnestness to benefit by his teaching did not at all see that
they were wasting his precious time so badly needed for other
important works. At last, Allah in order to eradicate this bad
manner, enjoined that when the people are asked to rise up from an
assembly, they should rise up and disperse. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another
vice prevalent among the people was that each person wished to have
secret counsel individually with the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
Allah's peace) without any real need, or would like that he should
approach him during an assembly and whisper something to him. This
was not only embarrassing for the Holy Prophet but also annoying for
the people who sat in the assembly. That is why Allah imposed the
restriction that anyone who wanted to consult him in private, should
first give away something in charity. The object was that the people
should be warned of this bad manner and made to give it up. Thus, the
restriction was kept in force for a short while, and when the people
had corrected their behavior, it was withdrawn. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From
verse 14 to the end of the Surah members of the Muslim society, which
was a mixture of the sincere Muslims and the hypocrites and the
waverers, have been told plainly as to what is the criterion of
sincerity in Islam. One kind of Muslims are those who are friends
with the enemies of Islam: they do not hesitate for the sake of their
interests to be treacherous to the religion which they profess to
believe in; they spread all sorts of doubts and suspicions against
Islam and prevent the people from adopting the Way of Allah. But
since they are part of the Muslim community their false profession of
Faith serves them as a cover and shield. The second kind of Muslims
are those who, in the matter of Allah's Religion, do not care even
for their own father, brother, children, and family, to say nothing
of others. They do not cherish any feeling of love for the person who
is an enemy of God and His Messenger and His Religion. Allah in these
verses has explicitly stated that the people of the first kind, in
fact, belong to Satan's party however hard they may try to convince
others of their Islam by swearing oaths. And the honor of belonging
to Allah's party is possessed only by the Muslims of the second kind.
They alone are the true Muslims: they alone will attain to true
success, and with them alone is Allah well pleased. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	was relating the zihar pronounced by her husband and complaining to
	the Holy Prophet to the effect that if she was separated from her

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The lady
	concerning whom these verses were sent down was Khaulah
	bint-Tha`labah of the Khazraj tribe, and her husband, Aus bin Samit
	Ansari, was brother of Hadrat `Ubadah bin Samit, the chief of the
	Aus tribe. The story of the zihar upon her is related in detail
	below. What is worth mentioning here is that the incident of the
	lady's complaint being heard by Allah Almighty and the coming down
	of the Divine command immediately to redress her grievance was an
	event that earned her a place of honor and esteem among the
	Companions. Ibn Abi Hatim and Baihaqi have related that once Hadrat
	`Umar was on his way out with some companions. On the way he came
	across a woman, who stopped him; he immediately stopped and listened
	to what she had to say patiently with his head bent down, and did
	not move till she had finished. One of the companions said: 'O
	Commander of the Faithful, you held back the Quraish chiefs for so
	long for the sake of this old woman!&quot; Hadrat `Umar said: &quot;Do
	you know who she is?She is Khaulah bint-Tha'labah, the lady whose
	complaint was heard at the seventh heaven. By God! even if she had
	kept me standing till the night, I would have kept standing; I would
	only have excused myself at the Prayer times.&quot; Ibn `Abdul Barr
	has related in Al-Isti ab this tradition from Qatadah: &quot;When
	Hadrat `Umar came across this lady, on the way, he greeted her.
	After answering his greeting, she said, &quot;Hey, O `Umar, there
	was a time when I saw you at the `Ukaz, festival. Then you were
	called `Umair. You tended goats with the shepherd's staff in your
	hand. Then, not very long after this, you began to be called `Umar.
	Then a time came when the people began addressing you as Commander
	of the Faithful. So, fear Allah with regard to your subjects, and
	remember that the one who fears Allah's punishment, for him the
	stranger also is like a close kinsman, and the one who fears death,
	may well lose that very thing which he wants to save.' At this,
	jarud 'Abdi, who was accompanying Hadrat `Umar, said: O woman, you
	have talked insolently to the Commander of the Faithful. &quot;
	Thereupon Hadrat `Umar said: Let her say whatever she has to say. Do
	you know who she is?-She was heard at the seventh heaven. So, she
	deserves to be heard longer and with greater attention by 'Umar.&quot;
	Imam Bukhari also has related briefly a story resembling this in his
	History.&nbsp;

	the Arabs it often so happened that during a family quarrel, the
	husband in the heat of the moment would say to his wife: Ant-i
	alayya ka-zahr-i ammi which literally means: &quot;You are for me as
	the back of my mother.&quot; But its real meaning is: &quot;To have
	sexual relations with you would be like having sexual relations with
	my mother. &quot; Such words are still uttered by the foolish
	people, who, as the result of a family quarrel, declare the wife to
	be like their mother, or sister, or daughter, and make her unlawful
	for themselves like the prohibited women. This is called zihar. Zahr
	in Arabic is metaphorically used for riding and mounting. Thus, the
	conveyance is called zahr, because man rides on its back. As this
	word was employed in order to make the wife unlawful the formula was
	termed 'zihar&quot;. In the pre-Islamic days this was looked upon as
	tantamount to the pronouncement of divorce, even of greater effect
	than that, for they took it to mean that the husband was not only
	severing his marital relations with his wife but was also declaring
	her to be unlawful for himself like his mother. On this very basis,
	the Arabs thought reunion could be possible after a divorce but it
	was impossible after zihar.</P>

	will sanctity and prohibition be established for her by reason,
	morality and law which, by virtue of this actual fact, is only
	reserved for the mother who gave birth? Thus, Allah by this

	for God has not given him the authority that he may treat a woman as

	To understand this, it is necessary that one should keep in mind the
	incidents of zihar that took place in the time of the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be Allah's peace), for the code of law pertaining to
	zihar is derived from the verses and the judgments that the Holy
	Prophet gave after the revelation of these verses in the cases of
	zihar brought before him. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas, the first case of zihar in Islam was
	the one relating to Aus bin Samit Ansari, on whose wife Khaulah's
	complaint Allah sent down these verse:. Although the details of this
	case that the traditionists have cited from several reporters
	contain minor differences, yet the elements of legal import and
	significance are almost agreed upon. A resume of these traditions is
	as follows: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Aus bin Samit had grown a little peevish in old age and according to
	Some traditions, had also developed an ailment resembling insanity.
	The reporters have described it by the word lamam which is not
	exactly madness in Arabic but a state resembling it. In this state
	he had also pronounced zihar on his wife several times before, but
	in Islam this was the first occasion that he pronounced it as the
	result of a quarrel with her. Thereupon, his wife appeared before
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and relating the whole
	story to him, said: &quot;O Messenger of Allah: Is there any way out
	of this situation that could save me and my children from ruin?&quot;
	The Holy Prophet's reply has been reported in different words by
	different reporters. In some traditions the words are to the effect:
	&quot;No command has been given to me so far in this regard,&quot;
	and in some others the words are: &quot;In my opinion you have
	become unlawful to him,&quot; and in still others: &quot;You arc
	unlawful to him.&quot; At this, she began to cry and complain and
	told the Holy Prophet over and over again that her husband had not
	pronounced the words of divorce; therefore, he should suggest a way
	by which she and her children and her old husband's life could be
	saved from ruin. But the Holy Prophet gave her the same reply every
	time. In the meantime he underwent the state of receiving revelation
	and these verses were revealed. After this, he said to her (and
	according to other traditions, he called her husband and told him)
	to free a slave. When they expressed their inability to do so, he
	said that the husband would have to observe two months' fast
	consecutively. She said: &quot;Aus is such a man that unless he eats
	and drinks three times a day, his sight starts failing him. &quot;
	The Holy Prophet said, &quot;Then, you will have to feed 60 poor
	people. &quot; They submitted that they did not have the means for
	that unless they were helped out by him. Thereupon the Holy Prophet
	gave them food articles that could suffice 60 men for two meals.
	Different quantities of it have been mentioned in different
	traditions. According to some traditions Hadrat Khaulah herself gave
	to her husband food articles equal in quantity to those given by the
	Holy Prophet so that he may perform the expiation. (Ibn Jarir,
	Musnad Ahmad Abu Da'ud, Ibn Abi Hatim). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second incident of zihar relates to Salamah bin Sakhr Bayadi. He had
	a somewhat abnormal appetite for sex. When the fasting month of
	Ramadan came, he, fearing that he might lose self-control in daytime
	in the state of fasting, pronounced zihar on his wife till the end
	of Ramadan. Hut he could not adhere to his pledge and went in to his
	wife one night. Penitent he appeared before the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be Allah's peace) and told him what he had done. He told him to
	release a slave. He said he had no one else beside his wife, whom he
	could release. The Holy Prophet then told him to observe two months'
	consecutive fast. He replied that it was during obligatory fasting
	itself that he had been unable to control himself and had become
	involved in trouble. The Holy Prophet then said that he should feed
	60 poor people, He replied that they were poor themselves and had
	gone to bed at night without food. Thereupon the Holy Prophet got
	him a sufficient quantity of food articles from the collector of the
	zihar of Bani Zurayq so that he may feed 60 persons and may also
	save some thing for his children. (Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud. Tirmadhi
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	incident that has been related without any reference to the name is
	that a man pronounced zihar on his wife and then had sexual
	intercourse with her even before making the expiation Then, when he
	came to the Holy Prophet to ask for the legal verdict, he commanded
	him to abstain from her till he had made the expiation. (Abu Da'ud,
	Tirmidhi, Nasa i Ibn Majah). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	fourth incident is that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's

	said to him angrily: &quot;Is she your sister?&quot; But he did not
	regard it as zihar,. (Abu Da'ud).

	&quot;that they return to that which they said,&quot; but in view of
	the Arabic language and idiom great differences have occurred in
	determining the meaning of these words: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Their one
	meaning can be: &quot;If they repeat the words of zihar after they
	have uttered them once. &quot; The Zahiriyyah and Bukair bin
	al-Ashajj and Yahya bin Ziyad al-Farm' hold this very view, and a
	saying from `Ata' bin Abi Rabah also has been reported in support of
	the same. According to-them, the pronouncement of zihar once is
	forgiven; however, if a person repeats it, he becomes liable to make
	the expiation. Hut this commentary is expressly wrong for two
	reasons: first, that Allah has condemned zihar as an absurd thing
	and a falsehood and then prescribed a penalty for it. Now, it is not
	conceivable that if a man utters falsehood or absurdities once he
	should be excused and if he utters it the second time he should make
	himself liable to punishment. The second reason of its being wrong
	is that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) never asked
	the man pronouncing zihrir whether he had pronounced it once or
	twice. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Its
	second meaning is &quot;If the people who were used to uttering
	zihar in the pre Islamic days of ignorance, repeat it in Islam, they
	will incur this punishment.&quot; This would mean that zihar should
	by itself be liable to punishment, and who ever utters the words of
	zihar for his wife, should become liable to make the expiation
	whether he may divorce the wife after it, or his wife may die; or he
	may have no intention of resuming conjugal relations with his wife.
	This view is hold by Ta-us Mujahid, Sha'bi, Zuhri, Sufyan Thauri and
	Qatadah from among the jurists They say that if the woman dies after
	the zihar, the husband cannot inherit her unless he made: the
	expiation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	meaning is: &quot;If after uttering the words of zihar the man may
	wish to go back on his words and makr amends for what he said &quot;
	In other words, 'ada lima gala means that the man revoked what he
	had said. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	fourth meaning is: &quot;If the man may wish to make lawful what he
	had made unlawful for himself by pronouncing the zihar &quot; In

	unlawful for himself has now returned to make it lawful views.

	This law of zahir abrogates the Arabian custom of ignorance
	according to which the marriage contract stood annulled and the
	woman became permanently forbidden to the husband. Likewise, this
	law annuls all those laws and customs which regard zihar as a
	meaningless custom, which is of no legal effect, and permit man to
	continue having marital relations with his wife as usual even after
	having compared her to his mother and other prohibited relations.
	For in the sight of Islam the sanctity of the mother and other
	prohibited relations is not such an ordinary thing that a man may
	even think of the comparison between them and his wife, not W speak
	of uttering it with the tongue. Between the two extremes the
	position adopted by the Islamic law in this regard is based on three
	principles: (a) That the marriage contract is not annulled by zihar,
	but the woman continues to be the husband's wife as usual, (b) that
	the woman becomes only temporarily prohibited to the man by zihar,
	and (c) that this prohibition operates till the time that the
	husband makes the expiation, and that the expiation only can remove
	the prohibition </FONT></FONT>

	As for the person pronouncing zihar, it is agreed that the zihar of
	that husband is only reliable, who is of sound mind and mature age
	and pronounces the words of zihar in his right senses; the zihar of
	the child or of the insane person is not reliable. Moreover, the
	zihar of the person who might not be in his right senses at the time
	of pronouncing its words is also not reliable, e.g. if he mutters
	words during sleep, or is senseless, due to any reason. However, the
	jurists have differed on the following points:</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(a)
	About -the person who pronounces zihar in the state of intoxication
	a great majority of them including the four Imams have given the
	verdict that since he has intentionally used the intoxicant, his
	zihar, like his divorce, will be regarded as valid legally, for he
	has undergone this state deliberately. However, if he has taken a
	medicine on account of illness and has been intoxicated, or has been
	compelled to take wine in intense thirst in order to save life, his
	zihar and divorce pronounced in that state will not be enforced.
	This very view is held by the Hanafis and the Shafe`is and the
	Hanbalis and the same also was the view commonly held by the
	Companions of the Holy Prophet. Contrary to it, Hadrat `Uthman held
	the view that the zihar and divorce pronounced in the state of
	intoxication are not reliable. Imam Tahawi and Karkhi from among the
	Hanafis hold this view as preferable and a statement of Imam Shafa'
	i also supports it. According to the MalikIs the zihar pronounced in
	the state of intoxication will be reliable in case the person
	concerned has not wholly lost his senses, but talks sensibly and
	coherently and knows what he is saying. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(b)
	According to Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Malik, only the zihar of the
	husband who is a Muslim is reliable. These injunctions do not apply
	to the non-Muslim subjects of the Islamic state, for the Qur'anic
	words: Alladhina yazahiruna minkum: &quot;those from among you who
	put away their wives by zihar, have been addressed to the Muslims,
	and the fasting, which is one of the three kinds of the expiations
	prescribed in the Qur'an, obviously cannot be applicable to the
	non-Muslim subjects. According to Imam Shafe`i and Imam Ahmad, these
	injunctions will be applicable both to the Muslims and to the
	non-Muslims; however, there is no fasting for the non-Muslim
	subject: he may only free a slave or feed 60 poor. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(c)
	Can a woman also, like a man, pronounce zihar? For instance will it
	be zihar if she says to her husband: `You are for me as my father,
	or I am for you like your mother? &quot; The four Imams say that
	this is not zihar and , the legal injunctions of zihar do not apply
	to it at all. For the Qur'an in express words has laid down these
	injunctions in respect of the cases , where the husbands pronounce
	zihar on their wives, and the authority to pronounce zihar, can be
	held only by him who holds the authority to pronounce divorce. Just
	as the Shari'ah not given the woman the power to divorce the
	husband, so also it has not given her the power to make her own self
	unlawful to her husband. This same is the view of Sufyan Thauri,
	Ishaq bin Rahawaiyh, Abu Thaur and Laith bin Sa'd. They regard such
	a pronouncement by a woman as meaningless and without effect Imam
	Abu Yusuf. says that though this is not ,zihar, it will entail for
	the woman the atonement of the oath, for the pronouncement of such
	words by the woman means that she has sworn not to have marital
	relations with her husband. This same is the view of Imam Ahmad bin
	Hanbal as cited by Ibn Qadamah. Imam Auza'i says that if before
	marriage the woman said that if she marred a particular man he would
	be for her as her father, it would be .zihar, and if she says such a
	thing after marriage it would be in the nature of an oath, which
	would entail the atonement for the oath. Contrary to it, Hasan
	Basri, Zuhri, Ibrahim Nakha'i and Hasan bin Ziyad Lu'lu'i say that
	this is zihar and will entail the expiation prescribed for zihar by
	the woman; however, the woman will not have the right to prevent the
	husband from coming in to her before making the expiation. Ibrahim
	Nakha`i has cited this incident in support of this view. Mus'ab, son
	of Hadrat Zubair, sent a proposal of marriage to 'A'ishah bint
	Talhah. She turned down the proposal, saying: &quot;If I marred him,
	he would be for me as the back of my father (huwa `alayya ka-zahr-i
	abi). &quot; After some time, she became willing to marry him. When
	the jurists of Madinah were asked for their ruling on it, many
	jurists including several Companions of the Holy Prophet ruled that
	'A'ishah would have to make an expiation for the zihar. After citing
	this incident Ibrahim Nakha'i has expressed his own opinion, saying
	that if 'A'ishah had said this thing after the marriage it would not
	have entailed the expiation. But since she said this before marriage
	when she had the option to marry, or not to marry, the expiation
	became obligatory on her. </FONT></FONT>

	The excuse of a sensible and mature person, who pronounces the
	express words of zihar in his full senses, cannot be acceptable that
	he uttered the words in a state of anger, or in jest, or in lout, or
	that he had no intention of the zihar. However, in respect of
	the.words which are not express in this regard, and which can give
	different meanings, the injunction will vary according to their
	nature. Below we shall tell what words of zihar arc express and what

	It is agreed upon by all that zihar can be pronounced on the woman
	who is a wedded wife of the man. However, there is a difference of
	opinion whether zihar can be pronounced on the other woman also or
	not. In this matter, the following are the different viewpoints: </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	Hanafis say that if a man says to the other woman: &quot;If I marry
	you, you will be for me as the back of my mother,&quot; then
	whenever he marries her, he will not be allowed to touch her without
	first making the expiation. This same is the verdict of Hadrat
	'Umar. During his caliphate a man said such words to a woman and
	afterwards married her. Hadrat 'Umar ruled that he would have to
	make the expiation for the zihar. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	Malikis and the Hanbalis also have expressed the same opinion, and
	they add this to it: If the woman was not specified, but the man
	said words to the effect that all women were for him like that, then
	whichever woman he married, he would have to make the expiation
	before touching her. The same is the opinion of Sa'id bin
	al-Musayyab, 'Urwah bin Zubair, 'Ata' bin Abi Rabah, Hasan Basri and
	Ishaq bin Rahawaiyh. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	Shafe'is say that zihar before marriage is meaningless. Ibn 'Abbas
	and Qatadah also hold the same opinion. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(5)
	Can zihar be pronounced for a fixed term? The Hanafis and the
	Shafe`is say that if a man has pronounced zihar for a certain period
	of time, he will have to make the expiation if he touches the wife
	before the expiry of that time; however, the zihar will become
	ineffective when the time has elapsed. Its argument is the incident
	concerning Salamah bin Sakhr Bayadi, who had pronounced zihar upon
	his wifc for the month of Ramadan, and the Holy Prophet (upon whom
	be Allah's peace) did not tell him that the fixation of the time
	limit was meaningless. On the contrary, Imam Malik and Ibn Abi Laila
	say that whenever zihar is pronounced it will be for ever and the
	specification of time will be of no effect, for the prohibition that
	has occurred cannot become void of its own accord on the expiry of
	the time. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(6)
	If the zihar is conditional, expiation will become incumbent
	whenever the condition is violated. For instance, if a man says to
	his wife: &quot;If I enter the houses you will be to me as the back
	of my mother,&quot; then whenever he enters his house, it will be
	unlawful for him to touch his wife without first making-the
	expiation. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(7)
	In case the words of zihar, are repeated several times to a wife,
	the Hanafis ant the Shafe`is say that whether this is done in one
	sitting or in several sittings, it will entail as many expiations as
	the number of the times the word were repeated, unless the man might
	have repeated the words only to stress what he had said before.
	Contrary to this, Imam Malik and lmam Ahmad bin Hanbal say that no
	matter how often the wards are repeated, it will entail only one
	expiation. The same is the view of Sha`bi, Ta'us, `Ata` bin Abi
	Rabah Hasan Basri and Auza`i (may Allah show mercy to all of them).
	Hadrat 'All's ruling is that if the repetition is made in one
	sitting, there will be only one expiation, and if in different
	sittings, then there will be as many expiations as the number of the
	sittings in which the repetition was made. The same is the view of
	Qatadah ant 'Amr bin Dinar. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(8)
	If zihar is pronounced upon two or more wives simultaneously in one
	and the same set of words, e.g. if addressing them the husband says:
	&ldquo;You are to me as the back of my mother,&quot; the Hanafis and
	the Shafe`is say that separate expiations will have to be made to
	make each of them lawful. The same is the opinion of Hadrat `Umar,
	Hadrat `Ali, `Urwah bin Zubair, Ta'us, `Ata, Hasan Basri, Ibrahim
	Nakha`i, Sufyan Thauri and Ibn Shihab Zuhri. Imam Malik and Imam
	Ahmad say that in this case one and the same expiation will suffice
	for all. Rabi`ah, Auza`i, Ishaq bin Riihawaiyh and Abu Thaur also
	have expressed the same opinion. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(9)
	It is agreed upon by all that if a man repeats zihar, again after

	Although it is sinful, according to the four Imams, to establish
	marital relations with the wife before malting the expiation, and
	the man should ask for Allah's forgiveness for it, and should
	refrain from repeating such a thing, yet it will entail only one
	expiation. The Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) had
	exhorted the people who had committed such an offense in his time to
	implore Allah for forgiveness and not to touch the wife unless they
	had made the expiation, but he did not enjoin any additional
	expiation besides the expiation for zihar Hadrat `Amr bin `As,
	Qabisah bin Dhu'aib, Sa'id bin Jubair, Zuhri and Qatadah say that it
	will entail two expiations, and Hasan Basri and Ibrahim Nakha'i have
	given the opinion that this will entail three expiations, Probably
	the Ahadith in which the Holy Prophet gave his ruling on this matter
	did not reach these scholars. </FONT></FONT>

	As to comparison of the wife to whom would be zihar, the jurists

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>'Amir
	Sha'bi says that her comparison to the mother only is zihar, and the
	Zahiriyyah say that her comparison only to the mother's back is
	zihar, for the injunction dces not supply to anything else. No
	section of the Islamic jurists, however; agrees with them in this
	regard, for the reason given by the Qur'an of the wife's comparison
	to the mother being sinful is that it is absurd and a lie. Now,
	obviously comparison of the wife to the women whose sanctity is just
	like the mother's would be as absurd as it is in the case of the
	mother Therefore, there is no reason why the commandment in that

	compared to such part of the body which is forbidden for a man to

	this discussion about the words of zihar one should clearly
	understand that aII the disputes of the jurists in this regard
	relate to the words and usage of the Arabic language. Obviously the
	people who speak other languages will neither pronounce zihar in
	Arabic nor will utter an exact and accurate translation of the
	Arabic words and sentences at the time they pronounce zihar.
	Therefore, if one has to decide whether a word or a sentence comes
	under the definition of zihar, or not, one should not examine it
	from the point of view of its being an exact translation of the
	words given by the jurists, but one should only see whether the
	speaker had compared his wife in the sexual context clearly to any
	of the women in the prohibited degrees, or whether there was the
	probability of other meanings also in his words. Its most
	conspicuous example is the Arabic sentence itself about which all
	the jurists and commentators are agreed that this very sentence was
	used for zihar in Arabic, i.e. Ant-i alayya ka-zahr-i ummi(&quot;You
	are to me like the back of my mother&quot;). Probably in no other
	language of the world can the man pronouncing zihar use words that
	may be a literal translation of this Arabic sentence. However, he
	can certainly use words of his own language, which may have
	precisely the same meaning for which an Arab used this sentence. The
	meaning of this sentence was: &quot;To have sexual intercourse&quot;with
	you would be like having sexual intercourse with my mother,&quot; or
	as some foolish person might say to his wife: &quot;If I come in to

	In the Holy Qur'an what has been mentioned as entailing the
	expiation is not the mere zihar but one's and (returning) after the
	zihar. That is, if a man only pronounces the zihar and does not
	`return&quot;, he does not incur any expiation. Now, the question
	is: What is this and {returning) that entails the expiation? In this
	regard, the jurists have held the following viewpoints: </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	Hanafis say that and is the intention to have the sexual
	intercourse, but it does not mean that the mere intention should
	entail the expiation; so much so that the man may have to make the
	expiation even if he does not take any practical step after the
	intention. But its correct meaning is that the man who wishes to
	remove the prohibition that he had imposed on him by by pronouncing
	zihar of severing marital relations with his wife, should first make
	the expiation, for this prohibition cannot be removed without the
	expiation. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Three
	statements have been cited from Imam Malik in this regard, but his
	most well known and authentic statement, according to the MalikIs,
	is in full agreement with the Hanafi view point, as stated above. He
	says that what the man had made unlawful for himself by zihar was
	the sexual relation with his wife. Now, and means that he should

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Imam
	Ahmad bin Hanbal's view as cited by Ibn Qadamah is almost the same
	as of the two Imams as noted above. He says that after the zihar
	expiation has necessarily to be made to make the sexual intercourse
	law ful. The man who wants to make it lawful after having pronounced
	zihar, in fact, wants to return from the prohibition. Therefore, ho
	has been enjoined to make the expiation before making it lawful for
	himself, precisely like the man who wants to make the other woman
	lawful for himself and has to marry her before she could be lawful
	for him.</FONT></FONT></P>

	Shafe`is viewpoint is quite different. He says that a man's keeping
	his wife as usual and detaining her in wedlock as before after
	having pronounced zihar, is aud, for as soon as he pronounced zihar
	he in fact, forbade himself to keep her as wife. Therefore, if he
	did not divorce her immediately on pronouncing zihar and kept her
	back for so long that he could utter the words of divorce, he
	committed and and the expiation became incumbent upon him. This
	means that if after pronouncing zIhar the man did not pronounce
	divorce in the next breath, expiation would become incumbent,
	whether after wards he might decide not to keep the woman as wife
	and might have no intention of having marital relations with her. So

	The Qur'anic injunction is that the pronounces of zihar must make
	the expiation before the two (the husband and the wife) &quot;touch&quot;
	each other. All the four Imams are agreed that according to this
	verse not only is the sexual intercourse prohibited before the
	expiation but it is also prohibited that the husband touch the wife
	in any way. The Shafe'i's regard' only touching with desist as
	prohibited. The Hanbalis regard every kind of pleasure-seeking as
	forbidden; and the Malikis regard even casting of the look at the
	wife's body for the sake of pleasure as unlawful. According to them
	only casting of the look at the face and hands is an exception. </FONT></FONT>

	If after zihar a man divorces his wife, he cannot touch her without
	first making the expiation in case it is a revocable divorce. If it
	is an irrevocable divorce, and he re-marries her, he still will have
	to make the expiation before he could touch her. So much so that
	even if he has divorced her thrice, and the woman after marrying
	another man becomes a widow, or is divorced, and then the pronounces
	of zihar re-marries her, she will not be lawful to him unless he
	first makes the expiation. For he has forbidden her to himself by
	comparing her to his mother or other prohibited woman, and. this
	prohibition cannot be removed without the expiation. All the four
	Imams agree about this. </FONT></FONT>

	It is incumbent upon the woman that she should not allow the husband
	who has pronounced zihar on her to touch her until he makes the
	expiation. And since the marital relationship is a right of the
	woman of which the husband has deprived her by zihar, she can go to
	the court of law if he does not make the expiation. The court will
	compel the husband to make the expiation to remove the barrier ht
	has raised between himself and her. And if he does not comply, the
	court can award him lashes or imprisonment or both. This also is
	agreed upon by alI the four schools of law. However, the difference
	is that in the Hanafi Fiqh this is the only way out for the woman;
	if the court does not help her out of the situation, she will remain
	suspended under zihar indefinitely. For zihar does not dissolve the
	marriage contract, it only forbids the husband to have marital
	relations with the wife. According to the Malikl school if the
	husband pronounces zihar and keeps the wife suspended with a vices
	to punish her, the law of ila' will be applied against him, which
	means that he cannot keep her suspended for more than four months.
	(For the law of ila, ste E.N.'s 245 to 247 of Al-Baqarah). According
	to the Shafe'is, although in zihar the law of ila' can be applied
	only if the husband might have pronounced zihar for a specific
	period, which does not exceed four months, yet since according to
	them the expiation becomes incumbent upon the husband from the very
	moment he keeps back the woman as wife, it is not possible that he
	may keep her suspended for along period indefinitely. </FONT></FONT>

	The express commandment of the Qur'an and the Sunnah is that the
	first expiation for zihar is to free a slave. If a man cannot afford
	this, he can expiate by fasting two months consecutively; and if he
	cannot do even this, then he can feed 60 poor. But if a man cannot
	expiate in any of the three ways, he will have to wait till he has
	the means to act in one or the other way, because the Shari'ah has
	not prescribed any other form of expiation. However, the sunnah
	confirms that such a person should be helped out so that he can make
	the third kind Of the expiation. The Holy Prophet helped such people
	out of the public treasury, who were caught in this awkward
	situation by a mistake of their own, and were helpless to expiate in

	) The Qur'an enjoins to release a neck (raqabah) as expiation, which
	applies both to a male and a female slave, and there is no
	restriction of the age in it. It would be sufficient to release a
	suckling child who may be in the state of slavery. However, the
	jurists have disputed whether both the believing and the unbelieving
	slaves can be released, or whether only the believing slave will
	have to be released. the Hanafis and the Zahiriyyah say that it is
	enough to release a slave, whether a believer or an unbeliever, as
	expiation for zihar for the Qur an only mentions raqabah (the neck);
	it does not say that it has to be a believer. On the contrary; the
	Shafe'is, the MalikIs and the Hanbalis impost the condition that it
	has to be a believing slave. They have held this injunction as
	analogous to the other expiations in which release of raqabah has

	If the pronouncer of zihar cannot afford to release a slave, the

	can touch each other. As for the details of acting on this Divine

	AII are agreed that the months imply the lunar months. If fasting is
	begun with the sighting of the new moon,.one will have to complete
	two months' un-interrupted fasting. If fasting is begun on another
	date in the month, according to the Hanafis and the Hanbalis, one
	will have to fast for 60 days consecutively; and according to the
	Shafe'is, one will observe a total of 30 fasts in the first and the
	third months and observe the whole of the middle lunar month,
	whether it is of 29 days or 30 days.</FONT></FONT></P>

	The Hanafis and the Shafe'is say that fasting should be begun at a
	time when within the next two months there should neither fall the
	month of Ramadan nor the two `Id days, nor the day of sacrifice, nor
	the Tashriq days (10th to 13th of Dhil-Hajj) for the observance of
	the Ramadan fast and its abandonment on the `Id days and the day of
	Sacrifice ant Tashriq days, in the course of the expiation fasting,
	would break the succession of the fasting, and the pronouncer of
	zihar would have to start fasting afresh. The Hanbalis say that

	In the course of the two months whether one abandons a fast on
	account of a valid excuse, or without a valid excuse, in both cases
	the succession will break according to the Hanafis and the Shafe`is,
	and one will have to start fasting afresh. The same is the opinion
	of Imam Muhammad Baqir, Ibrahim Nahka`i, Sa'id bin Jubair, and
	Sufyan Thauri. According to Imam Malik and Imam Ahmad, fasting can
	be abandoned on account of illness or a journey and this does not
	break the succession; however, succession does break if the fast is
	abandoned without a valid reason. Their reasoning is that the nature
	of the expiation fast is not obligatory as of the Ramadan fast: when
	that fast can be abandoned on account of an excuse, there is no
	reason why this cannot be. The same is the viewpoint of Hadrat
	`Abdullah bin `Abbas, Hasan Basri, `Ata' bin Abi Rabah, Sa`id bin

	According to the Qur'an and the Sunnah, the third kind of expiation
	(feeding the 60 poor) can be made only by him who does not have the
	power to make the second expiation (fasting for two months
	successively). The . details of acting on this command as worked out
	by the jurists are as follows: </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(a)
	According to all the four Imams, being powerless to observe the fast
	means that one should either he powerless due to old age, or due to
	illness, or due to the reason that one may not be able to abstain
	from sexual intercourse for two successive months, and may become
	impatient at any time in the course of fasting. The validity of aII
	these three excuses is confirmed by the Ahadith that have been cited
	in connection with the cases of Aus bin Samit Ansari and Salamah bin
	Sakhr Bayadi. However, about illness there is a little difference of
	opinion among the jurists. The Hanafis say that the excuse of
	illness will be valid only in case there is no hope of recovery, or
	there is the fear that the disease may worsen on account of fasting.
	The Shafe`is say that if fasting is likely to cause a severe
	hardship by which the man may feel the danger of its being
	interrupted, this excuse also can be valid. The Malikis say that if
	the man strongly feels that he will be able to observe the fast in
	the future, he may wait till then, and if he has no such feeling, he
	should feed the poor. The Hanbalis say that the apprehension that
	the disease will worsen by fasting is a sufficient excuse for not
	fasting. </FONT></FONT>

	There is full agreement that feeding implies to feed two times a day

	of feeding. The Hanafis say that it is equally valid to feed with
	cooked food two times a day or to give away grain sufficient to meet
	the food requirements of a needy person two times a day, For the
	Qur'an has used the word it am, which means both to provide food and
	to feed. But the Malikis, the Shafe`is and the Hanbalis do not

	According to the Hanafis, it is also valid if one and the same poor
	person is fed or given food for 60 days, though it is not cornet to
	give him food for 60 days on one and the same day. However, the
	other three schools do not think it is valid to provide food to one
	and the same poor man; it is necessary to give food to 60 persons.

	This also is not permissible according to any of the four schools
	that one may fast for 30 days and then feed 30 poor ones, for two

	Although in connection with the expiation of feeding the Qur'an'
	does not use words to the effect that this expiation also should be
	made before the husband and the wife can touch each other yet the
	context demands that this restriction will apply to this third kind
	of expiation as well. That is why the four Imams do not regard it as
	permissible that the man should go to his wife during the time the
	expiation of feeding is being performed. However, the difference i6
	that according to the Hanbalis the man who commits this offense,
	will have to feed the poor afresh, but the Hanafis show leniency,
	for in respect of this third expiation there-is no mention of

	The commentators have given many answers to this question but in our

	maintaining the literary beauty of. the Qur'iin. Without this the
	style would have suffered from blemishes. Therefore, after making

	That is, they pronounced as-sam `alaika in such a manner as to give

	which is the Islamic way of greeting. But actually they had said
	&quot;Sam &quot;, which means death. In response the Holy Prophet

	death visit you and the curse of Allah!&quot; The Holy Prophet
	warned her, saying: &quot; `A'ishah, Allah does not like abusive

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote24sym" HREF="#sdfootnote24anc">24</A>This
	shows that najwa (talking secretly together) by itself is not
	forbidden, but it s being lawful or unlawful depends upon the
	character of the people who hold secret consultations and upon the
	circumstances under which such consultations are held, and upon
	nature of the consultations themselves, If the people whose
	sincerity, righteousness and purity of character arc well known, arc
	seen talking secretly together, nobody would have any misgiving that
	they were planning mischief. On the contrary, the whispering and
	secret consultations of the people who are notorious for their evil
	and wicked character, product in every mind. the suspicion that they
	arc engaged in a new conspiracy. Likewise, if a couple of persons
	talk for some time together on some matter secretly, it is not
	objectionable, but if some people have formed themselves into a gang
	and constantly engaged in a whispering campaign against the Muslim
	community, this would indeed be a prelude to some mischief. If
	nothing else, it would at least stir up divisions among the Muslims.
	Above all, the thing that decides whether najwa (secret counsel) is
	lawful or unlawful is the nature of the things talked of it. If two
	men hold a secret counsel in order to bring a dispute the an end,
	and to restore a person's right, or to bring a dispute an end, or to
	restore a person's right, or to promote a good cause, it is no evil,
	but rather and act of virtue, On the contrary, if the same secret
	counsel between two men is held with a view to creating mischief, or
	usurping the rights of . others, or committing a sin, obviously the
	object itself would be evil and the secret counsel about it evil
	added to evil.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, the teaching given by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) of social etiquette is: &quot;When three men are
	sitting together, no two of them should whisper to each other, for
	this would cause anguish to the third. &quot; (Bukhari, Muslim,
	Musnad Ahmad Thirmidhi Adu Da'ud). In another Hadith, the Holy
	Prophet said: &quot;Two men should not whisper together, without the
	leave of the third, for this would cause him anguish. &quot;
	(Muslim). This objectionable sort of whispering also applies to the
	cast when two of the three men start talking in a language which is
	not understood by the third, and even more objectionable would be
	that during their whispering they should look towards the third
	person or gesticulate in a manner as to suggest that he is the topic
	of discussion between them.&nbsp;

	has been said so that if a Muslim watches some other people
	whispering, which causes him the doubt that it is directed against
	him, he should not feel so offended as to start planning a
	counter-attack on the basis of mere suspicion, or begin to nourish
	grief, or malice, or undue concern in his heart. He should
	understand that no one can harm him except by Allah's leave. This
	conviction would inspire him with such confidence that he would feel
	delivered of many a useless worry and imaginary danger and leaving
	the wicked to themselves would remain engaged in peacefully doing
	his duty. The believer who has trust in Allah is neither a

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote26sym" HREF="#sdfootnote26anc">26</A>This
	has been explained in the Introduction to the Surah above. Some
	commentators regard this Command as restricted to the assemblies of
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace). But as pointed out by
	Imam Malik, the correct view is that this is a general instruction
	for the assemblies held by the Muslims. One of the rules of
	etiquette taught by Allah and His Messenger to the Muslims is that
	when they arc sitting in an assembly and some more people arrive,
	they should have the courtesy to accommodate the new-comers and
	should squeeze in together as far as possible to make room for them
	to sit. The new-comers also should have the courtesy not to press in
	forcibly and make others rise up in order to take their place. In
	the Hadith Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Umar and Hadrat Abu Hurairah have
	reported that the Holy Prophet said: Nobody should make another
	person rise up so as to take his place, but you should yourself make
	room for others. &quot; (Musnad Ahmad Bukhari Muslim). And Hadrat
	`Abdullah bin `Amr bin 'As reports that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;It

	the end. This caused him inconvenience and discomfort as well as

	were asked to rise up and disperse from the assembly, you were
	disgraced. The real means of exaltation of ranks is faith and
	knowledge, and not an opportunity to sit nearest to the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be Allah's peace) in his assembly and sit the longest. If
	a person happened to sit nearer to him, it does not mean that he
	became exalted in rank, for the high ranks belong only to those who
	have attained to the wealth of knowledge and faith. Likewise, the
	person who prolonged his sitting with the Holy Prophet only to cause
	him inconvenience and discomfort, in fact, displayed lack of good
	manners. His there sitting near him for a long ;time will not exalt

<DIV ID="sdfootnote29">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote29sym" HREF="#sdfootnote29anc">29</A>According
	to Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas, this Command was sent down because
	the Muslims had started requesting the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) for private counsel much too frequently; and this put
	him to great inconvenience. At last, Allah willed to relieve His
	Prophet of this burden.. (Ibn Jarir). Zaid. bin Aslam says that the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) would never turn down the
	request of anyone, who wanted to consult him in private. Whoever
	desired to have private counsel with him, he would oblige him Often
	it so happened that the people would ask for private counsel in
	matters in which there was no real need. This was the time when all
	of Arabia was engaged in war against Madinah. Sometimes after a
	person had made such a request, Satan would whisper into the ears of
	the people the idea that he had brought to the Holy Prophet the news
	of invasion by such and such tribes, and this would cause rumors to
	spread in Madinah. On the other hand, this would give the hypocrites
	an opportunity to say that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) was
	a credulous person, who listened to and believed in whatever anyone
	told him. Because of this Allah imposed the restriction that anyone
	who wanted to have private counsel with the Prophet should first
	give away something in charity. (Ibn 'Arabi: Ahkam al-Qur an).
	Qatadah says that some people talked to the Holy Prophet in private
	in order to show their superiority to others.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	'Ali says when this was enjoined the Holy Prophet asked him, What
	should be the quantity of the charity? Should it be one dinar? I
	said: This is more than the people can afford. The Holy Prophet then
	asked: Should it be half a dinar? I said: This too is too much. Then
	he asked what it should be. I said . Gold equal to a barley grain.
	The Holy Prophet remarked: Your advice is for too little! &quot;
	(Ibn Jarir, Tirmidhi, Musnad Abu ya'la). In another tradition Hadrat
	`Ali says: &quot;This is a verse of the Qur'an which no one acted
	upon except me. As soon as it was enjoined, I offered the charity
	and consulted the Holy Prophet about a problem. &quot; (Ibn Jarir,

	things have been stated in this verse: first, a matter of principle,
	and the second, a statement of fact. The matter of principle is that
	faith in the true Religion and love of the opponents of the Religion
	are contradictory things, which cannot conceivably co-exist in one
	and the same place. It is absolutely impossible that love of the
	Faith and love of the enemies of Allah and His Messenger should
	co-exist in one and the same heart, just as a person's love for
	himself and his love for his enemy cannot co-exist in his heart
	simultaneously This is as if to say: 'lf you sec a person who
	professes the Faith as well as keeps relations of love with the
	opponents of Islam, you should never be involved in the
	misunderstanding that he might perhaps be true in his profession in
	spite of his this attitude and conduct. Likewise, the people who
	have established relations with Islam and the opponents of Islam
	simultaneously, should themselves also consider their position well
	and see what they actually are. Are they believers or hypocrites?
	And what actually they want to be to they want to live as believers
	or as hypocrites? If they have any righteousness left in them. and
	any feeling that from the. moral viewpoint hypocrisy is the meanest
	and most abject attitude for man, they should give up their attempt
	to ride in two boats simultaneously. Faith wants them to be
	decisive. If they want to remain believers, they should sever and
	sacrifice all those connections that clash with their relationship
	with Islam; if they hold another relation dearer to themselves than
	the relationship with Islam, then they should better give up their
	false profession of Islam.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here,
	Allah has not just stated the principle but has also presented the
	actual fact as a model before those who professed the Faith. The
	true believers had in actual fact severed all connections that
	clashed with their relationship with Allah's Religion. This had been
	witnessed by entire Arabia in the' battles of Badr and Uhud. The
	emigrants from Makkah had fought against their own tribe and closest
	kinsmen only for the sake of Allah and His Religion. Hadrat Abu
	`Ubaidah killed his father, 'Abdullah bin al-jarrah. Hadrat Mus`ab
	bin `Umair killed his brother, 'Ubaid bin `Umair; Hadrat Umar killed
	his maternal uncle, 'As bin Hisham bin Mughirah; Hadrat 'Abu Bakr

	Hamzah and Hadrat 'Ubaidah bin al-Harith killed 'Utbah, Shaibah and
	Walid bin `Utbah, who were their close kinsmen. About the prisoners
	of war captured at Badr, Hadrat 'Umar gave the opinion that they
	should all be put to the sword, and proposed that a relative should
	kill a relative. In the same battle of Badr when Hadrat Mus'ab bin
	'Umair saw that an Ansari Muslim had captured his real brother, Abu
	'Aziz bin `Umair, and was tying him, he shouted out to him, saying:
	&quot;Tie him tight: his mother is a rich woman. She will pay you a
	large ransom.&quot; Abu 'Aziz said: `You are a brother and say
	this?' Hadrat Mus'ab replied: &quot;Not you, but this Ansari Muslim
	is my brother now, who has captured you. &quot; In the same battle
	of Badr Abul ' As. , the son-in-law of the Holy Prophet (upon whom
	he Allah's peace), was taken a prisoner and was shown no special
	favor any different from the other prisoners on account of his
