<H1 CLASS="heading-2-western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Name</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This Surah is named
Al-Fatihah because of its subject-matter. Fatihah is that which opens
a subject or a book or any other thing. In other words, Al-Fatihah is
a sort of preface. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="heading-2-western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Period
of Revelation</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It is one of the very
earliest Revelations to the Holy Prophet. As a matter of fact, we
learn from authentic Traditions that it was the first complete Surah
which was revealed to Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him). Before
this, only a few miscellaneous verses were revealed which form parts
of `Alaq, Muzzammil, Muddaththir, etc. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<H1 CLASS="heading-2-western"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Theme</FONT></FONT></H1>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This Surah is in fact a prayer which Allah has
taught to all those who want to make a study of His book. It has been
placed at the very beginning of the book to teach this lesson to the
reader: if you sincerely want to benefit from the Quran, you should
offer this prayer to the Lord of the Universe. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This preface is meant to create a strong desire
in the heart of the reader to seek guidance from the Lord of the
Universe, Who alone can grant it. Thus Al-Fatihah indirectly teaches
that the best thing for a man is to pray for guidance to the straight
path, to study the Quran with the mental attitude of a seeker-
after-truth and to recognize the fact that the Lord of the Universe
is the source of all knowledge. He should, therefore, begin the study
of the Quran with a prayer to him for guidance. </FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">From this theme, it becomes clear that the real
relation between Al-Fatihah and the Quran is not that of an
introduction to a book but that of a prayer and its answer.
Al-Fatihah is the prayer from the servant and the Quran is the answer
from the Master to his prayer. The servant prays to Allah to show him
guidance and the Master places the whole of the Quran before him in
answer to his prayer, as if to say, &quot;This is the Guidance you
begged from Me.&quot;</FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A NAME="sdfootnote1sym"></A>
	<A HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>Islamic culture requires a man to
	commence everything with the name of Allah. If this is done
	consciously and sincerely, it will surely produce three good
	results. First, it will keep him away from evil, because the very
	name of Allah will impel him to consider whether he is justified in
	associating His name with a wrong deed or an evil intention.
	Secondly, the very mention of the name of Allah will create in him
	the right attitude of mind and direct him to the right direction.
	Thirdly,he will receive Allah's help and blessing and will be
	protected from the temptations of Satan, for Allah turns to a man
	when he turns to Him.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote2" DIR="LTR">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A NAME="sdfootnote2sym"></A>
	<A HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>It has been stated in the
	Introduction to this Surah that AI-Fatihah is a prayer. It begins
	with the praise of Allah to Whom it is addressed in order to teach
	us the right way of making a supplication. We should not put forward
	our request bluntly and abruptly without an appropriate
	introduction. The right way is to acknowledge the excellences and
	the favors and the high position of the One to Whom we address our
	prayer. That is why we begin our prayer with the praise of Allah,
	for He is the perfection of all excellences and .is also our
	Benefactor. We pay homage to Allah to show that we sincerely
	acknowledge His excellences and also are grateful to Him for His
	countless favours. It should also be noted that not only Praise is
	for Allah but also Praise is only for Allah. This distinction is
	very important because it cuts at the root of the worship of any of
	His creation. As none of them is worthy of praise, none is worthy of
	worship. No man, no angel, no prophet, no so-called god, no star, no
	idol, in short. none of His creation inherently possesses any good
	quality. If one has any, it is given by Allah. Hence the Creator of
	these qualities alone deserves devotion, worship, gratitude, and
	none of His creation.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote3" DIR="LTR">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A NAME="sdfootnote3sym"></A>
	<A HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>The word Rab which has been
	translated into `Lord' stands for (a) Master and Owner, (b)
	Sustainer, Provider and Guardian, (c) Sovereign, Ruler,
	Administrator and Organizer. Allah is the Lord of the Universe in
	all these senses.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote4" DIR="LTR">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A NAME="sdfootnote4sym"></A>
	<A HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>Although the Arabic word Rahman
	itself is in the superlative form and denotes the attributes of
	beneficence and mercy in the highest degree, even this word fails to
	express the boundless extent of these attributes of Allah. Hence
	another word Rahim of the same root has been added to make up for
	the deficiency.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote5" DIR="LTR">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A NAME="sdfootnote5sym"></A>
	<A HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>After saying that Allah is Beneficent
	and Merciful, it has immediately been added that He is the Master of
	the Day of Judgment, so that the qualities of mercy and kindness
	might not mislead anyone into forgetting that on that Day He will
	gather together all human beings from the first to the last and
	require each and every one to give an account of all of one's acts
	to Him. A Muslim should, therefore, always keep in view the fact
	that Allah is not only Merciful, but He is also Just. He has,
	however, full authority to pardon or punish anyone He pleases, for
	He has complete power over everything. Therefore we should have full
	conviction that it lies absolutely in His power to make our end
	happy or sorrowful.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A NAME="sdfootnote6sym"></A>
	<A HREF="#sdfootnote6anc">6</A>The Arabic word ibadat is used in
	three senses: (a)worship and devotion, (b) submission and obedience,
	(c) subjection and servitude. Here it implies all the three, that
	is, We are Thy worshipers, Thy subjects and Thy slaves and We keep
	these relations with Thee and Thee alone and &quot;We make none else
	the object of our worship in all the three senses.&quot;</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A NAME="sdfootnote7sym"></A>
	<A HREF="#sdfootnote7anc">7</A>It means, We ask for Thy help because
	we know that Thou art the Lord of the whole Universe and Thou hast
	all powers and Thou art the Master of every thing. Therefore we turn
	to Thee for help for the fulfillment of our needs and requirements.</P>

	<A HREF="#sdfootnote8anc">8</A>That is, &quot;Show us that way which
	may lead us aright in every walk of life and keep us absolutely free
	from errors and evil consequences and bring us success in the end.&quot;
	, This is the request which the servant of Allah makes to Him when
	he begins the study of the Qur'an. He prays to Him to guide him in
	every walk of life and save him from the labyrinths of doubt and
	uncertainty, which result from the lack of true knowledge. The
	servant also requests the Master to show him the right and the
	straight way of life from among the many by-paths and crooked ways.</P>

	<A HREF="#sdfootnote9anc">9</A>The straight way for which we are
	praying is the way which has always been followed by the people
	favored by Thee and which has always brought Thy favors and
	blessings.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote10" DIR="LTR">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A NAME="sdfootnote10sym"></A>
	<A HREF="#sdfootnote10anc">10</A>This is to show that the favored
	people are not those who go astray and incur the wrath of Allah,
	though apparently they might be enjoying the transitory good things
	of life. The really favored people are those who receive blessings
	on account of their righteous living. From this it also becomes
	clear that by favors are meant those real and permanent rewards,
	which result from righteous living and from winning the pleasure of
	Allah, and not those transitory good things of life which have been
	enjoyed even by the tyrants and worshipers of mammon and which are
	being enjoyed even today by all sorts of evildoers who have gone
	astray from the straight way.</P>
