traditions show that different people on different occasions had
questioned the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) about the essence

people, and on every occasion he recited by Allah's command this very
Surah in response. First of all, the pagans. of Quraish asked him
this question in Makkah, and in reply this Surah was sent down. Then,
at Madinah, sometimes the Christians, and sometimes the other people
of Arabia, asked him questions of this nature, and every time Allah
inspired him to recite this very Surah in answer to them. In each of
these traditions, it has been said that this Surah was revealed on
this or that occasion. From this one should not form the impression
that all these traditions are mutually contradictory. The fact is
that whenever there existed with the Holy Prophet a verse or a Surah
previously revealed in respect of a particular question or matter,
and later the same question was presented before him, Allah inspired
him to recite the same verse or Surah to the people as it contained
the answer to their question. The reporters of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hadith</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">describe the same thing, saying: When
such and such a question or matter was presented before the Holy
Prophet, such and such a verse or Surah was revealed. This has also

verse or Surah several times. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

the fact is that this Surah is Makki, rather in view of its subject

detailed verses of the Quran dealing with the essence and attributes
of Allah Almighty had not yet been revealed, and the people hearing,
the Holy Prophet's invitation to Allah, wanted to know what was his
Lord like to whose worship and service he was calling them. Another
proof of this Surah's being one of the earliest Surahs to be revealed
is that when in Makkah Umayyah bin Khalaf, the master of Hadrat
Bilal, made him lie down on burning sand and placed a heavy stone on
his chest, Bilal used to cry &quot;</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ahad,

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">A

The idolatrous polytheists were worshiping gods made of wood, stone,
gold, silver and other substances. These gods had a form, shape and
body. The gods and goddesses were descended from each other. No
goddess was without a husband and no god without a wife. They stood
in need of food and drink and their devotees arranged these for them.
A large number of the polytheists believed that God assumed human
form and there were some people who descended from Him. Although the
Christians claimed to believe in One God, yet their God also had at
least a son, and besides the Father and Son, the Holy Ghost also had
the honor of being an associate in Godhead: so much so that God had a
mother and a mother-in-law too. The Jews also claimed to believe in
One God, but their God too was not without physical, material and
other human qualities and characteristics. He went for a stroll,
appeared in human form, wrestled with a servant of His, and was
father of a son, Ezra. Besides these religious communities, the
Zoroastrians were fire worshipers, and the Sabeans star worshipers.
Under such conditions when the people were invited to believe in
Allah, the One Who has no associate, it was inevitable that questions
arose in the minds as to what kind of a God it was, Who was one and
Only Lord and invitation to believe in Whom was being given at the
expense of all other gods and deities. It is a miracle of the Quran
that in a few words briefly it answered all the questions and
presented such a clear concept of the Being of Allah as destroyed all
polytheistic concepts, without leaving any room for the ascription of
any of the human qualities to His Being. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

	word for the Arabs. They had been using this very word for the
	Creator of the universe since the earliest times, and they did not
	apply this word to any of their other gods. For the other gods they
	used the word ilah. Then their beliefs about Allah had become fully
	manifest at the time Abraha invaded Makkah. At that time there
	existed 360 idols of gods (ilahs) in and around the Ka`bah, but the
	polytheists forsaking all of them had invoked only Allah for
	protection. In other words, they knew in their hearts of hearts that
	no ilah could help them on that critical occasion except Allah. The
	Ka`bah also was called Bait-Allah by them and not Bait-ilahs after
	their self-made gods. At many places in the Qur'an the polytheistic
	Arabian belief about Allah has been expressed, thus:

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Keeping

	&quot;Who is your Lord and what is He like to Whose service and

	He Whom you invoke for help at critical times beside all other

	comprehends all the perfect and excellent attributes of Allah.
	Therefore, it is not at all conceivable that the Creator of the
	universe, its Administrator and Disposer of its affairs, Sustainer
	of all the creatures living in it, and the Helper of the servants in
	times of hardship, would not be living, hearing and seeing, that He
	would not be an All-Powerful, All-Knowing, All-Wise, All-Merciful

<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>The
	scholars have explained the sentence Huwa-Allah Ahad syntactically,
	but in our opinion its explanation which perfectly corresponds to
	the context is that Huwa is the subject and Allahu its predicate,
	and Ahad-un its second predicate. According to this parsing the
	sentence means: &quot;He (about Whom you are questioning me) is
	Allah, is One and only one. Another meaning also can be, and
	according to language rules it is not wrong either: &quot;He is
	Allah, the One.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, the
	first thing to be understood is the unusual use of ahad in this
	sentence. Usually this word is either used in the possessive case as
	yaum ul-ahad (first day of the week), or to indicate total negative
	as Ma ja a a-ni ahad-un (No one has come to me), or in common
	questions like Hal `indaka ahad-un (Is there anyone with you?), or
	in conditional clauses like Inja'a-ka ahad-un (If someone comes to
	you), or in counting as ahad, ithnan, ahad ashar (one, two, eleven).
	Apart from these uses, there is no precedent in the pre-Qur'anic
	Arabic that the mere word ahad might have been used as an adjective
	for a person or thing. After the revelation of the Qur'an this word
	has been used only for the Being of Allah, and for no one else. This
	extraordinary use by itself shows that being single, unique and
	matchless is a fundamental attribute of Allah; no one else in the
	world is qualified with this quality: He is One, He has no equal. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then,
	keeping in view the questions that the polytheists and the followers
	of earlier scriptures asked the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	about his Lord, let us see how they were answered with ahad-un after
	Huwa-Allah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, it
	means: &quot;He alone is the Sustainer: no one else has any share or
	part in providence. and since He alone can be the Itch (Deity) Who
	is Master and Sustainer, therefore, no one else is His associate in
	Divinity either.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	it also means &quot;He alone is the Creator of the universe: no one
	else is His associate in this work of creation. He alone is the
	Master of the universe, the Disposer and Administrator of its
	system, the Sustainer , of His creatures, Helper and Rescuer in
	times of hardship; no one else has any share or pan whatever in the
	works of Godhead, which as you yourselves acknowledge, are works of
	Allah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly
	since they had also asked the questions: of what is your Lord made?
	what is His ancestry? What is his sex? From whom has He inherited
	the world and who will inherit it after Him? -all these questions
	have been answered with one word ahad for Allah. It means: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) He
	alone has been, and will be, God for ever; neither was there a God
	before Him, nor will there be any after Him; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) there
	is no race of gods to which He may belong as a member: He is God,
	one and single, and none is homogeneous with Him; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) His
	being is not merely One (wahid) but ahad, in which there is no tinge
	of plurality in any way.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">He is not
	a compound being, which may be analyzable or divisible. which may
	have a form and shape, which may be residing somewhere, or may
	contain or include something, which may have a color, which may have
	some limbs, which may have a direction, and which may be variable or
	changeable in any way. Free from every kind of plurality He alone is
	a Being Who is Ahad in every aspect. (Here, one should fully
	understand that the word wahid is used in Arabic just like the word
	&quot;one&quot; in English. A collection consisting of great
	pluralities is collectively called wahid or one, as one man, one
	nation, one country, one world, even one universe, and every
	separate part of a collection is also called one. But the word Ahad
	is not used for anyone except Allah. That is why wherever in the
	Qur'an the word wahid has been used for Allah, He has been called
	itah wahid (one Deity), or Allah-ulWahid-al-Qahhar. (One Allah Who
	is Omnipotent), and nowhere just wahid, for this word ' is also used
	for the things which contain pluralities of different kinds in their
	being. On the contrary, for Allah and only for Allah the word Ahad
	has been used absolutely, for He alone is the Being Who exists
	without any plurality in any way, Whose Oneness is perfect in every
	way.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Abu Bakr
	al-Anbari &quot;There is no difference of opinion among the

	whom the people turn for fulfillment of their desires and needs and
	in connection with other affairs.&quot; Similar to it is the view of
	Az-Zajjjaj, who says &quot;Samad is he in whom leadership has been
	perfected, and to whom one turns for fulfillment of one's needs and
	desires.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now, let
	us consider why Allahu-Ahad has been said in the first sentence and
	why Allah-us-Samad in this sentence. About the word ahad we have
	explained above that it is exclusively used for Allah, and for none
	else. That is why it has been used as ahad, in the indefinite sense.
	But since the word samad is used for creatures also, Allah-us-Samad
	has been said instead of Allah Samad, which signifies that real and
	true Samad is Allah alone. If a creature is samad in one sense, it
	may not be samad in some other sense, for it is mortal, not
	immortal; it is analyzable and divisible, is compound, its parts can
	scatter away any time; some creatures are dependent upon it, and
	upon others it is dependent; its chieftaincy is relative and not
	absolute; it is superior to certain things and certain other things
	are superior to it; it can fulfill some desires of some creatures
	but it is not in the power of any creature to fulfill all the
	desires of all the creatures, On the contrary, Allah is perfect in
	His attributes of Samad in every respect; the whole world is
	dependent upon Hun in its needs, but He is ,not dependent upon
	needs; everything in the world turns to Him, consciously or
	unconsciously, for its survival and for fulfillment of the needs of
	everyone; He is immortal and Ever-living; He sustains others and is
	not sustained by anyone; He is Single and Unique, not compound so as
	to be analyzable and divisible; His sovereignty prevails over entire
	universe and He is Supreme in every sense. Therefore, He is not only
	.Samad but As-Samad, i e. the Only and One Being Who is wholly and
	perfectly qualified with the attribute of samad in the true sense. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then,
	since He is As-Samad, it is necessary that He should be Unique, One
	and Only, for such a being can only be One, which is not dependent
	upon anyone and upon whom everyone else may be dependent; two or
	more beings cannot be self-sufficient and fulfiller of the needs of
	all. Furthermore, His being As-samad also requires that He alone
	should be the Deity, none else, for no sensible person would worship
	and serve the one who had no power and authority to fulfill the
	needs of others.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote5">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>The
	polytheists in every age have adopted the concept that like men,
	gods also belong to a species, which has many members and they also
	get married, beget and are begotten. They did not even regard Allah,
	Lord of the universe, as supreme and above this concept of
	ignorance, and even proposed children for Him. Thus, the Arabian
	belief as stated in the Qur'an was that they regarded the angels as
	daughters of Allah. The Prophetic communities too could not remain
	immune from this creed of paganism. They too adopted the creed of
	holding one saintly person or another as son of God. Two kinds of
	concepts have always been mixed up in these debasing superstitions.
	Some people thought that those whom they regarded as Allah's
	children, were descended from him in the natural way and some others
	claimed that the one whom they called son of God, had been adopted
	by Allah Himself as a son. Although they could not dare call anyone
	as, God forbid, father of God, obviously human mind cannot remain
	immune against such a concept that God too should be regarded as a
	son of somebody when it is conceived that He is not tree from sex
	and procreation and that He too, like man, is the kind of being
	which begets children and needs to adopt a son in case it is
	childless, That is why one of the questions asked of the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace) was: what is the ancestry of Allah? and
	another was: from whom has He inherited the world and who will
	inherit it after Him? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If these
	assumptions of ignorance are analyzed, it becomes obvious that they
	logically necessitate the assumption of some other things as well.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that God should not be One, but there should be a species of Gods,
	and its members should be associates in the attributes, acts and
	powers of Divinity. This not only follows from assuming God
	begetting children but also from assuming that He has adopted
	someone as a son. for the adopted son of somebody can inevitably be
	of his own kind. And when, God forbid, he is of the same kind as
	God, it cannot be denied that he too possesses attributes of
	Godhead. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second,
	that children cannot be conceived unless the male and the female
	combine and some substance from the father and the mother unites to
	take the shape of child. Therefore, the assumption that God begets
	children necessitates that He should, God forbid, be a material and
	physical entity, should have a wife of His own species, and some
	substance also should issue from His body. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Third,
	that wherever there is sex and procreation, it is there because
	individuals are mortal and for the survival of their species it is
	inevitable that they should beget children to perpetuate the race.
	Thus, the assumption that God begets children also necessitates that
	He should, God forbid, Himself be mortal, and immorality should
	belong to the species of Gods, not to God Himself. Furthermore, it
	also necessitates that like all mortal individuals, God also, God
	forbid, should have a beginning and an end. For the individuals of
	the species whose survival depends upon sex and procreation neither
	exist since eternity nor will exist till eternity. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Fourth,
	that the object of adopting some one as a son is that a childless
	person needs a helper in his lifetime and an heir after his death.
	Therefore, the supposition that Allah has adopted a son inevitably
	amounts to ascribing all those weaknesses to His sublime Being which
	characterize mortal man. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Although
	all these assumptions are destroyed as soon as Allah is called and
	described as Ahad and As-Samad, yet when it is said: &quot;Neither
	has He an offspring nor is He the offspring of another&quot;, there
	remains no room for any ambiguity in this regard. Then, since these
	concepts are the most potent factors of polytheism with regard to
	Divine Being, Allah has refuted them clearly and absolutely not only
	in Surah Al-Ikhlas but has also reiterated this theme at different
	places in different ways so that the people may understand the truth
	fully. For example let us consider the following verses: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Allah
	is only One Deity: He is tar too exalted that He should have a son:
	whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth belongs to
	Him.&quot; (AnNisa': 171) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Note
	it well: they, in fact, invent a falsehood when they say, `Allah has
	children'. They are utter liars,&quot; (As-Saaffat: 151-152) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;They
	have invented a hood-relationship between Allah and the angels,
	whereas the angels know full well that these people will be brought
	up (as culprits)&quot; (As-Saaffat: 158) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;These
	people have made some of His servants to be part of Him. The fact is
	that man is manifestly ungrateful. &quot; (Az-Zukhruf: l 5 ) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Yet
	the people have set up the Jinn as partners with Allah, whereas He
	is their Creator; they have also invented for Him sons and daughters

	thing, the one equal in rank and position. In the matter of
	marriage, kufu' means that the boy and the girl should match each
