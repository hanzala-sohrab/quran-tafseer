have already briefly referred to the conditions of that period in the
introduction to Surah Al-Kahf. Here we shall give rather fuller
details of the same conditions, which will be helpful in grasping the
meaning of this Surah and the other Surahs of the period. When the
chiefs of the Quraish felt that they had failed to suppress the
Islamic movement by ridicule, sarcasm, and by holding out promises
and threats and by making false accusations, they resorted to
persecution, beating and economic pressure. They would catch hold of
the new Muslims of their clans and persecute them, starve them and
would even inflict physical torture on them in order to coerce them
to give up Islam. The most pitiful victims of their persecution were
the poor people and the slaves and the proteges of the Quraish. They
were beaten black and blue, were imprisoned and kept thirsty and
hungry and were dragged on the burning sands of Makkah. The people
would get work from the professional laborers but would not pay them
their wages. As an instance we give below the story of Hadrat Khabbab
bin Arat, which is given in </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Bukhari</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

the same connection Hadrat Khabbab says, &quot;One day the Holy
Prophet was sitting in the shadow of the Ka'abah. I went to him and
said, '0 Messenger of Allah, now persecution has gone to its extreme;
why do you not pray to Allah (for relief)?' At this the Holy Prophet
was greatly moved. He said, 'The believers before you were persecuted
much more than you. Their bones were scraped with combs of iron and
their heads were cut with saws, but still they did not give up their
Faith. I assure you that Allah will fulfill this Mission, and there
will come a period of such peace that one would travel from Sanna to
Hadramaut, and he will have no fear from anyone, save Allah. But you
people have already become impatient'.&quot; (</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Bukhari</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">)

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
the conditions became unbearable, the Holy Prophet, in the month of
Rajab of the fifth year of Prophethood, gave advice to his Companions
to this effect: &quot;You may well migrate to Habash, for there is a
king, who does not allow any kind of injustice to anyone, and there
is good in his land. You should remain there till the time that Allah
provides a remedy for your affliction&quot;. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Accordingly,
at first, eleven men and four women left for Habash. The Quraish
pursued them up to the coast but fortunately they got a timely boat
for Habash at the sea-port of Shu'aibah, and they escaped attest.
Then after a few months, other people migrated to Habash and their
number rose to eighty-three men and eleven women of the Quraish and
seven non-Quraish. After this, only forty persons were left with the
Holy Prophet at Makkah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There
was a great hue and cry in Makkah after this Migration, for every
family of the Quraish was adversely affected by this. There was
hardly a family of the Quraish which did not lose a son, a
son-in-law, a daughter, a brother or a sister. For instance, there
were among the Migrants the near relatives of Abu Jahl, Abu Sufyan
and other chief of the Quraish who were notorious for their
persecution of the Muslims. As a result of this, some of them became
even more bitter in their enmity of Islam, while there were others
who were so moved by this that they embraced Islam. For instance,
this Migration left a deep mark on Hadrat Umar. One of his relatives,
Laila, daughter of Hathmah, says, &quot;I was packing my luggage for
Migration, while my husband, Amr bin Rabiy'ah, had gone out. In the
meantime Umar came there and began to watch me, while I was engaged
in preparation for the journey. Then he said, 'Are you also going to
migrate?' I answered, 'Yes by God, you people have persecuted us
much. But the wide earth of Allah is open for us. Now we are going to
a place where Allah will grant us peace'. At this, I noticed such
signs of emotion on the face of Umar as I had never seen before. He
simply said, 'May God be with you' and went away.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
the migration, the Quraish held consultations, and decided to send
Abdullah bin Abi Rabiy'ah, half brother of Abu Jahl, and Amr bin As
to Habash with precious gifts so as to persuade Negus to send the
migrants back to Makkah. Hadrat Umm Salmah (a wife of the Holy
Prophet), who was among the migrants, has related this part of the
story in detail. She says, &quot;When these two clever statesmen of
the Quraish reached Habash, they distributed the gifts among the
courtiers of the King and persuaded them to recommend strongly to him
to send the migrants back. Then they saw Negus himself and,
presenting rich gifts to him, said, &quot;Some headstrong brats of
our city have come to your land and our chiefs have sent us to you
with the request that you may kindly send them back. These brats have
forsaken our faith and have not embraced your faith either, but have
invented a new faith&quot;. As soon as they had finished their
speech, all the courtiers recommended their case, saying, &quot;We
should send such people back to their city for their people know them
better. It is not proper for us to keep them here.&quot; At this the
King was annoyed and said, &quot;I am not going to give them back
without proper inquiry. As these people have put their trust in my
country rather than in any other country and have come here to take
shelter, I will not betray them. At first I will send for them and
investigate into the allegations these people have made against them.
Then I will make my final decision&quot;. Accordingly, the King sent
for the Companions of the Holy Prophet and asked them to come to his
court. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
the migrants received the message of the King, they assembled and
held consultations as to what they should say to the King. At last
they came to this unanimous decision: &quot;We will present before
the King the teachings of the Holy Prophet without adding anything to
or withholding anything from them and leave it to him whether he lets
us remain here or turns us out of his country&quot;. When they came
to the court, the King put this problem abruptly before them:&quot;I
understand that you have given up the faith of your own people and
have neither embraced my faith nor any other existing faith. I would
like to know what your new faith is.&quot; At this, Jafar bin Abi
Talib, on behalf of the migrants, made an extempore speech to this
effect: &quot;O King! We were sunk deep in ignorance and had become
very corrupt; then Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) came to us as
a Messenger of God, and did his best to reform us. But the Quraish
began to persecute his followers, so we have come to your country in
the hope that here we will be free from persecution&quot;. After his
speech, the King said, &quot;Please recite a piece of the Revelation
which has been sent down by God to your Prophet&quot;. In response,
Hadrat Jafar recited that portion of Surah Maryam which relates the
story of Prophets John and Jesus (Allah's peace be upon them). The
King listened to it and wept, so much so that his beard became wet
with tears. When Hadrat Jafar finished the recital, he said:&quot;Most
surely this Revelation and the Message of Jesus have come from the
same source. By God I will not give you up into the hands of these
people&quot;. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Next
day `Amr bin `As went to Negus and said, &quot;Please send for them
again and ask them concerning the creed they hold about Jesus, the
son of Mary, for they say a horrible thing about him&quot;. The King
again sent for the migrants, who had already learned about the scheme
of Amr. They again sat together and held consultations in regard to
the answer they should give to the King, if he asked about the belief
they held about Prophet Jesus. Though this was a very critical
situation and all of them were uneasy about it, they decided that
they would say the same thing that Allah and His Messenger had taught
them. Accordingly, when they went to the court, the King put them the
question that had been suggested by Amr bin As. So Jafar bin Abi
Talib stood up and answered without the least hesitation: &quot;He
was a Servant of Allah and His Messenger. He was a Spirit and a Word
of Allah which had been sent to virgin Mary.&quot; At this the King
picked up a straw from the ground and said, 'Bye God, Jesus was not
worth this straw more than what you have said about him.&quot; After
this the King returned the gifts sent by the Quraish, saying, &quot;I
do not take any bribe&quot;. Then he said to the migrants, &quot;You
are allowed to stay here in perfect peace.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Keeping
in view this historical background, it becomes quite obvious that
this Surah was sent down to serve the migrants as a &quot;provision&quot;
for their journey to Habash, as if to say, &quot;Though you are
leaving your country as persecuted emigrants to a Christian country,
you should not in the least hide anything from the teachings you have
received. There- fore you should plainly say to the Christians that
Prophet Jesus was not the son of God.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

relating the story of Prophets John and Jesus in vv. 1-40, the story
of Prophet Abraham has been related (vv. 41-50) also for the benefit
of the Migrants for he also had been forced like them to leave his
country by the persecution of his father, his family and his country
men. On the one hand, this meant to console the Emigrants that they
were following the footsteps of Prophet Abraham and would attain the
same good end as that Prophet did. On the other hand, it meant to
warn the disbeliever, of Makkah that they should note it well that
they were in the position of the cruel people who had persecuted
their forefather and leader, Abraham, while the Muslim Emigrants were
in the position of Prophet Abraham himself. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;There
	was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, (see Bani Isra'il
	(XVII): E.N. 9) a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of
	Abiah: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name wag
	Elisabeth. And they were both righteous before God, walking in all
	the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless. And they had
	no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now
	well stricken in years. And it came to pass, that while he executed
	the priest's office before God in the order of his course, according
	to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to burn incense
	when he went into the temple of the Lord. And the whole multitude of
	the people were praying without at the time of incense. And there
	appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of
	the altar of incense. And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled,
	and fear fell upon him. But the angel said unto him, Fear not,
	Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; (there is no mention of
	Zacharias' prayer anywhere in the Bible) and thy wife Elisabeth
	shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John (that is,
	Yahya). And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice
	at his birth. For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord
	(Sayyidan: a great Leader according to the Qur'an, III: 39), and
	shall drink neither wine nor strong drink (the Quranic version:
	Taqiyynr. pious and pure); and he shall be filled with the Holy
	Ghost, even from his mother's womb (the Qur'an says: `We blessed him
	with &quot;judgment&quot; while he was yet a child'). And many of
	the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he
	shall go before him in the spirit of the power of Elias, to turn the
	hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the
	wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;And
	Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this for I am an
	old man, and my wife well stricken in years. And the angel answering
	said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of God; and
	am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
	And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the
	day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not
	my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season. (This is
	different from the Qur'an, which gives it as a Sign, whereas
	according to Luke, it was a punishment. Moreover, the Qur'an
	mentions it as the silence for `three consecutive days', but Luke
	says that Zacharias remained dumb till the birth of John). And the
	people .waited for Zacharias, and marveled that he tarried so long
	in the temple. And when he came out, he could not speak unto them:
	and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he
	beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.&quot; (Luke 1: 5-22).</P>

	following order:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to Luke, Prophet John was older than Prophet Jesus by six months and
	their mothers were cousins. He was appointed a Prophet at the age of
	30 years, and according to the Gospel of John, he started his
	mission of inviting the people toward God in Jordan. He would say:
	&quot;I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Make straight
	the way of the Lord.&quot; (John, I: 23)</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to Mark, &quot;John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the
	baptizm of repentance for the remission of sins. And there went out
	unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all
	baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.&quot;
	(Mark, I: 45). He thus came to be known as John the Baptist, and the
	Israelites held him as a prophet. (Mat. 21: 26). Prophet Jesus said
	about John: &quot;Among them that are born of women there hath not
	risen a man greater than John the Baptist.&quot; (Mat. 11 : 11) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;John
	had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his
	loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.&quot; (Mat. 3: 4).
	He would say: &quot;Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at
	hand.&quot; (Mat. 3: 2). By this he meant that very soon Prophet
	Jesus was going to start his Mission of Prophethood. The same thing
	has been said about him in the Qur'an: &quot;. . . he (John) will
	come to confirm a Command from Allah.&quot; (III: 39). For the same

	that has not been precisely marked out, except that every Rasul
	(Messenger) is a Nabi (Prophet) as well, but every Nabi may not be a
	Rasul, and that a Rasul has a special and more important mission to
	perform. This is supported by a Tradition of the Holy Prophet, which
	has been reported by Imam Ahmad from Abu Umamah and by Hakim from
	Hadrat Abu Zarr. When the Holy Prophet was asked how many
	&quot;Messengers&quot; and &quot;Prophets&quot; had been sent to the

	time the Holy Prophet and his Companions were passing through very
	hard times and were always expecting a Revelation to guide and
	comfort them. When Gabriel (peace be upon him) came with the angels
	with this Revelation, he at first delivered that part of the Message
	which was immediately needed. Then before proceeding further, he
	said these words by the leave of Allah as an explanation for the
	delay and to give them comfort from Allah and counsel of fortitude.
	This interpretation is not only borne out by the wording of the
	passage but also by some Traditions of the Holy Prophet, which have
	been cited by Ibn Jarir, Ibn Kathir, and the author of Ruh ulMa `ani
	in their commentary on this passage.

	great many authentic Traditions, which clearly state that the true
	Believers will never be cast into Hell. Lexically also, vurud (being
	presented unto) is not synonymous with dukhul (causing to enter).
	Therefore, the correct meaning would be that every human being will
	be presented before Hell, but then, as the next verse clarifies, the
	pious people will be rescued and the transgressors left therein on
