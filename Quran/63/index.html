<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before
we mention the particular incident about which this Surah was sent
down, it is necessary to have a look at the history of the hypocrites
of Madinah, for the incident that occurred on this occasion was not a
chance happening but had a whole series of events behind it, which
ultimately led up to it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before
the Holy Prophet's emigration to Madinah the tribes of the Aus and
the Khazraj, fed up with their mutual rivalries and civil wars, had
almost agreed on the leadership of one man and were making
preparations to crown him their king. This was Abdullah bin Ubayy bin
Salul, the chief of the Khazraj. Muhammad bin Ishaq has stated that
among the people of Khazraj his authority was never contested and
never had the Aus and the Khazraj rallied to one man before this.
(Ibn Hisham, vol. II, p. 234) </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Such
were the conditions when the voice of Islam reached Madinah and the
influential people of both the tribes started becoming Muslims. When
before the Emigration, invitation was being extended to the Holy
Prophet (upon whom be Allah'&gt; peace) to come to Madinah, Hadarat
Abbas bin Ubadah bin Nadlah Ansari wanted to defer this invitation
for the reason that Abdullah bin Ubayy also might join in the
declaration of allegiance and invitation to the Holy Prophet, so that
Madinah might become the center of Islam by common consent. But the
delegation that arrived in Makkah to declare their allegiance did not
give any importance to the proposal of Abbas bin Ubadah, and a11 its
members, who included 75 men from both the tribes, became ready to
invite the Holy Prophet in the face of every danger.(lbn Hisham, vol.
II, P. 89). We have given the details of this event in the
Introduction to Surah Al-Anfal. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
when the Holy Prophet arrived in Madinah, Islam had so deeply
penetrated every house of the Ansar that Abdullah bin Ubayy became
helpless and did not see any other way to save his leadership than to
become a Muslim himself. So, he entered Islam along with many of his
followers from among the chiefs and leaders of both the tribes
although their hearts were burning with rage from within. Ibn Ubayy
in particular was filled with grief, for the Holy Prophet (upon whom
be Allah's peace) had deprived him of his kingship. For several years
his hypocritical faith and grief of being deprived of his kingdom
manifested itself in different ways. On the one hand, when on Fridays
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) took his seat to
deliver the Sermon, Abdullah bin Ubayy would stand up and say &quot;O
people, the Messenger of Allah is present among you, by whom Allah
has honored you; therefore, you should support him and listen to what
he says and obey him.&quot; (Ibn Hisham, vol. III, p. 111). On the
other, his hypocrisy was being exposed day by day and the true
Muslims were realizing that he and his followers bore great malice
against Islam, the Holy Prophet and the Muslims. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Once
when the Holy Prophet was passing on the way Abdullah bin Ubayy spoke
to him in harsh words. When the Holy Prophet complained of it to
Hadrat Sa'd bin Ubadah; he said:&quot;O Messenger of Allah, don't be
hard on him, for when Allah sent you to us we were making a diadem to
crown him, and, by God, he thinks that you have robbed him of his
kingdom.&quot; (Ibn Hisham vol: II, pp. 237-238). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
the Battle of Badr when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)
invaded the Jewish tribe of Bani Qainuqa on their breaking the
agreement and un provoked revolt, this man stood up in support of
them, and holding the Holy Prophet by his armor, said:&quot;These 700
fighters have been helping and protecting me against every enemy;
would you cut them down in one morning?By God, I will not leave you
until you pardon my clients.&quot; (Ibn Hisham, vol. III, pp. 5l-
52). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On
the occasion of the Battle of Uhud this man committed open treachery
and withdrew from the battlefield with 300 of his companions. One
should note that at this critical moment when he so acted, the
Quraish had marched upon Madinah with 3,000 troops and the Holy
Prophet had marched out with only 1,000 men to resist them. Of these
1,000 this hypocrite broke away with 300 men and the Holy Prophet was
left with only 700 men to meet 3,000 troops of the enemy in the
field. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this incident the common Muslims of Madinah came to realize fully
that he was certainly a hypocrite and his those Companions also were
found who were his associates in hypocrisy. That is why when on the
very first Friday, after the Battle of Uhud, this man stood up as
usual to make a speech before the Holy Prophet's Sermon, the people
pulled at his garment, saying &quot;Sit down you are not worthy to
say such things.&quot; That was the first occasion in Madinah when
this man was publicly disgraced. Thereupon he was so filled with rage
that he left the mosque jumping over the heads of the people. At the
door of the Mosque some of the Ansar said to him, &quot;What are you
doing?Go back and ask the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)
to pray for your forgiveness.&quot; He retorted &quot;I do not, want
him to pray for my forgiveness.&quot; (Ibn Hisham, vol. III, p. 111).
</FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
in A. H. 4 the Battle of Bani an-Nadir took place. On this occasion
he and his companions supported the enemies of Islam even more
openly. On the one side, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's
peace) and his devoted Companions were preparing for war against
their enemy, the Jews, and on the other, these hypocrites were
secretly sending messages to the Jews to the effect: &quot;Stand firm
we are with you: if you are attacked, we will help you, and if you
are driven out, we too will go out with you.&quot; The secret of this
intrigue was exposed by Allah Himself, as has been explained in Surah
Al-Hashr: 11-17 above. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">But
in spite of being so exposed the reason why the Holy Prophet (upon
whom be Allah's peace) was still treating him kindly was that he had
a large band of the hypocrites behind him. Many of the chiefs of both
the Aus and the Khazraj were his supporters. At least a third of the
population of Madinah consisted of his companions, as became manifest
on the occasion of the Battle of Uhud. Under such conditions it was
not prudent to wage a war with these internal enemies combined with
the external enemies. On this very account, in spite of being fully
aware of their hypocrisy the Holy Prophet continued to deal with them
according to their apparent profession of faith for a long time. On
the other hand, these people too neither possessed the power nor the
courage to fight the believers openly as disbelievers, or to join
hands with an invader and face them in the battlefield. Apparently
they were a strong hand but inwardly they had the weakness which
Allah has vividly portrayed in Surah Al-Hashr: 12-14. Therefore; they
thought their well being lay only in posing as Muslims. They came to
the mosque, offered the prayers gave away the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">zakat</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
and would make tall oral claims to the faith, which the true Muslims
never felt the need to do. They would offer a thousand justifications
for each of their hypocritical acts by which they would try to
deceive their compatriots, the Ansar, into believing that they were
with them. By these designs they were not only saving themselves from
the disadvantages which could naturally accrue if they separated
themselves from the Ansar brotherhood, but also taking advantage of
the opportunities to make mischief which were available to them as
members of the Muslim brotherhood. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These
were the causes which enabled Abdullah bin Ubayy and like minded
hypocrites to get an opportunity to accompany the Holy Prophet (upon
whom be Allah's peace) in his campaign against the Bani al-Mustaliq,
and they simultaneously engineered two great mischiefs which could
shatter the Muslim unity to pieces. However, by virtue of the
wonderful training in discipline that the Muslim; had received
through the pure teaching of the Quran and the companionship of the
Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) both mischiefs were stopped in
time, and the hypocrites themselves were disgraced instead. One of
these was the mischief that has been mentioned in Surah An-Nur above,
and the other which has been mentioned in this Surah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
incident has been related by Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad, Nasai, Tirmidhi,
Baihaqi, Tabari, Ibn Marduyah, Abdur Razzaq, lbn Jarir Tabari, Ibn
Sa'd and Muhammad bin Ishaq through many reliable channels. In some
traditions the expedition in which it took place has not been named,
and in others it has been connected with the Battle of Tabuk. But the
authorities on the battles fought by the Holy Prophet and history are
agreed that this incident took place on the occasion of the campaign
against the Bani al- Mustaliq. The following seems to he the real
story when all the traditions are read together. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
after crushing down the power of Bani al- Mustaliq the Islamic army
had made a halt in the settlement at the well of al Muraisi. Suddenly
a dispute arose between two men on taking water from the well; One of
them was Jehjah bin Masud Ghifari, a servant of Hadrat Umar appointed
to lead his horse. The other was Sinan bin Wabar al-Juhani, whose
tribe was an ally of a clan of the Khazraj. Harsh words between them
led to fighting and Jehjah kicked Sinan, which the Ansar, on account
of their ancient Yamanite tradition, took as a great insult and
disgrace. At this Sinan called out the men of Ansar and Jehjah the
Emigrants for help. Hearing about the quarrel Ibn Ubayy started
inciting and calling the men of the Aus and the Khazraj to come out
and help their ally. From the other side some Emigrants also came
out. The dispute might have led to a fight between the Ansar and the
Muhajirin themselves at the very place where they had just fought an
enemy tribe jointly and crushing it had halted in its own territory.
But hearing the noise the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) emerged
and said :&quot;what is this call of paganism? What have you to do
with such a call? Leave it, it is a dirty thing.&quot; Thereupon the
leading men of the two sides met and settled the dispute; Sinan
pardoned Jehjah and peace was restored. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this every person whose heart was disaffected came to Abdullah bin
Ubayy and they all said to him, &quot;Until now we had our hopes
attached to you and you were protecting us, but now it seems you have
become a helper of these paupers against us. Ibn Ubayy was already
enraged: These words made him burst out, thus: &quot;This is what you
have done to yourselves. You have given these people shelter in your
country, and have divided your property among them. So much so that
they have now become our rivals. Nothing so fits us and the paupers
of Quraish(or the Companions of Muhammad) as the ancient saying 'Feed
your dog to fatten it and it will devour you.' If you hold back your
property from them, they would go elsewhere. By God, when we return
to Madinah, the honorable ones will drive out from it the mean ones.&quot;

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Zaid
bin Arqam, a young boy, also happened to be present in the assembly
at that time. He heard this and mentioned it before his uncle, and
his uncle who was one of the Ansar chiefs went to the Holy Prophet
(upon whom be peace) and told him the whole story. The Holy Prophet
called Zaid and asked him what had happened and he repeated every
word of what he had heard. The Holy Prophet said, &quot;Zaid, you are
perhaps displeased with Ibn Ubayy; you might have been mistaken in
hearing; you. might have imagined Ibn Ubayy said this.&quot; But Zaid
was sure and firm. He said, &quot;No, I swear by God I have heard him
say this and that.&quot; Thereupon the Holy Prophet called Ibn Ubayy,
and he came and swore that he had not said any such thing. The people
of the Ansar also said &quot;Sir, a boy says this: he might have been
mistaken in what he heard lbn Ubayy is a venerable old man and our
chief. Do not believe what a boy says against him.&quot; The elderly
people of the tribe reproved Zaid also, who became depressed and held
his peace. But the Holy Prophet knew Zaid as well as Abdullah bin
Ubayy. Therefore, he fully understood what had actually happened. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
Hadrat Umar came to know of this, he came to the Holy Prophet and
said:&quot;Please allow me to put this hypocrite to the sword. Or, if
you do not think it is fit to give me the permission you may tell
Muadh bin Jabal, or Abbad bin Bishr, or Sad bin Mu'adh, or Muhammad
bin Maslamah from among the Ansar, to go and kill him.&quot;But the
Holy Prophet said: &quot;No, the people will say Muhammad kills his
own Companions.&quot; After this he ordered the people to set off
immediately, although it was at a time when the Holy Prophet was not
accustomed to travel. The forced march continued for 30 hours at a
stretch so that the people became exhausted. Then he halted, and as
soon as they touched the ground they fell asleep. This he did to
distract their minds from what had happened at the well of
al-Muraisi. On the way, Hadrat Usaid bin Hudair, an Ansar chief, met
the Holy Prophet, and said:&quot;O Messenger of Allah, today you
ordered the people to set off at a time which was disagreeable for
traveling, a thing you have never done before.&quot;The Holy Prophet
replied: &quot;Have you. not heard of what your friend said?&quot;
When he asked who he meant, the Holy Prophet replied:Abdullah bin
Ubayy. He asked what he had said. The Holy Prophet answered: &quot;He
has asserted that when he returns to Madinah the honorable ones will
drive out from it the mean ones. He answered : &quot;By God, O
Messenger of Allah, you are the honorable one and he is the mean one;
you will drive him out whenever you want to.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>By
and by the news spread among the Ansar soldiers and it enraged them
against Ibn Ubayy. The people advised him to go to the Holy Prophet
(upon whom be Allah's peace) and request for his forgiveness, but he
retorted : &quot;You asked me to believe in him, and I believed in
him; you asked me to pay the zakat on my property, and I paid the
zakat too; now the only thing left is that I should bow down to
Muhammad.&quot;This further enraged the believing Ansar and everyone'
started reproaching and cursing him roughly. When the caravan was
about to enter Madinah, Abullah, the son of Abdullah bin Ubayy, stood
before his father with a drawn out sword, and said: &quot;You had
said that when you reached Madinah, the honorable ones would drive
out the mean ones. Now, you will know who is honorable you or Allah
and His Messenger. By God, you cannot enter Madinah until the
Messenger of Allah (upon whom be Allah's peace) permits you to
enter.&quot; At this Ibn Ubayy cried out: &quot;O people of Khazraj,
look, my own son is preventing me from entering Madinah.&quot; The
people conveyed this news to the Holy Prophet, and he said : &quot;Tell
Abdullah to let his father come home.&quot;Abdullah said, &quot;If
this is the Holy Prophet's order, then you may enter.&quot;Thereupon
the Holy Prophet said to Hadrat Umar: &quot;Now what do you think,
Umar? Had you killed him on the day when you asked my permission to
kill him, many people would have trembled with rage. Today if I order
them to kill him, they will kill him immediately.&quot;Hadrat Umar
replied &quot;By God, I realize there was greater wisdom behind what
the Apostle of Allah said than what I said.&quot;' </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	regarded as truthful because he is testifying to the right thing,

	he is steadfast in his Judaism, states the same thing, he would be
	stating the right thing but his evidence would be regarded as false,

	by Hadrat Zaid bin Arqam. Besides these, there is another
	probability that Allah might have regarded this statement of theirs
	as an oath: &quot;We bear witness that you are Allah's Messenger.&quot;
	This last probability has given rise to a dispute among the jurists,
	namely: If a person states something with the words: &quot;I bear
	witness,&quot; will it be regarded as an oath or not? Imam Abu
	Hanifah and his companions (except Imam Zufar), Imam Sufyan Thauri
	and Imam Auza'i regard it as an oath (Yamin in the Shari'ah
	terminology). Imam Zufar says that it is not an oath. Two sayings
	from Imam Malik have been reported in this connection: first&quot;
	that it is an oath absolutely, and second, that if while saying: &quot;I
	bear witness,&quot; his intention was to say: &ldquo;My God, I bear
	witness,&quot; or &quot;I bear witness before God,&quot; it would he
	a statement on oath, otherwise not. Imam Shafe'i says: 'Even if the
	person says the words: &quot;I bear witness before God.&quot; it
	would not be a statement made on oath, unless he uttered these words
