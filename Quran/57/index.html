<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">This
is unanimously a Madani Surah, and a study of its subject matter
shows that it was probably sent down some time during the interval
between the Battle of Uhud and the Truce of Hudaibiyah. This was the
time when the tiny Islamic State of Madinah had been hemmed in by the
disbelievers and the handful of the ill equipped Muslims were
entrenched against the combined power of entire Arabia. In this state
Islam not only stood in need of the sacrifice of Life from its
followers, but it also needed monetary help and assistance. In this
Surah a forceful appeal has been made for the same. This view is
further strengthened by verse 10 in which Allah has addressed the
believers to the effect &quot;Those of you who would spend and fight
after the victory can never be equal to those who have spent and
fought before the victory.&quot; And the same is supported by the
traditions that Ibn Marduyah has related on the authority of Hadrat
Anas. In respect of the verse: </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Alam

he says that 17 years after the commencement of the revelation of the
Qur'an this verse was sent down to arouse the believers to action.

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
theme of this Surah is to exhort the Muslims to spend in the cause of
Allah. At the most critical juncture of the history of Islam when it
was engaged in a life and death struggle against Arab paganism, this
Surah was revealed to persuade the Muslim's to make monetary
sacrifices in particular, and to make them realize that Islam did not
merely consist in verbal affirmation and some outward practices but
its essence and spirit is sincerity towards Allah and His Religion.
The faith of the one who was devoid of this spirit and who regarded
his own self and wealth as dearer to himself than Allah and His
Religion, was hollow and therefore of little worth in the sight of
Allah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

mentioned so that the listeners may fully realize as to Who is
addressing them. Then, the following themes have been expressed in
sequence: </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<OL>
	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	inevitable demand of the Faith is that one should not shirk spending
	one's wealth for the sake of Allah. This would not only be contrary
	to the Faith but also wrong realistically. For the wealth indeed
	belongs to Allah, on which man has been given proprietary rights
	only as His vicegerent. Yesterday this wealth was in other people's
	possession today it is with one particular man, and tomorrow it will
	pass into some one else's hand. Ultimately, it will go back to
	Allah, Who is the inheritor of everything in the universe. Only that
	much of this wealth will be of any use to a man, which he spends in
	the cause of Allah during the period it is in his possession. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<LI><P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although
	making sacrifices for the sake of Allah is commendable in any case,
	the true worth of these sacrifices is determined by the nature of
	the occasion. There is an occasion when the power of paganism is
	overwhelming and there is a danger that it might subdue and overcome
	Islam completely; there is another occasion when Islam is in a
	stronger position in its struggle against un-Islam and the believers
	are attaining victories. Both these states are not equal as regards
	their respective importance. Therefore, the sacrifices that are made
	in these different states would also not be equal. Those who
	sacrifice their lives and expend their wealth to further promote the
	cause of Islam when it is already strong cannot attain to the rank
	of those who struggled with their lives and their wealth to promote
	and uphold the cause of Islam when it was weak. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	the people would rise to support and succor His true Religion even
	at the risk of their lives. These opportunities Allah has created
	for man's own advantage and development; otherwise Allah does not
	stand in need of others for His works. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	came from Allah in the past, and by their preaching some people
	adopted the Right Path, but most of them persisted in wickedness.
	Then the Prophet Jesus came, whose teachings brought about many
	moral improvements in the lives of the people, but his community
	invented monasticism. Now Allah has sent the Prophet Muhammad (upon
	whom be His peace and blessings). Those who affirm faith in him and
	pass their life fearing Allah's accountability, will be given by
	Allah a double share of His mercy and He will bless them with the
	Light by which they will see and walk the straight path among the
	crooked paths met with at every step in the life of this world.
	Although the followers of the earlier revelation regard themselves
	as the monopolists of Allah's bounties, the fact remains that Allah
	Himself controls His bounties He may bless with these whomever He
	pleases. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>That
	is, not only is He All-Mighty and All-Wist, but the truth is that He
	afoot is All-Mighty and All-Wise. The word 'Aziz signifies a mighty
	and powerful Being Whose decrees cannot be prevented by any power in
	the world from being enforced, Whom no one can oppose and resist,
	Who has to be obeyed by every one whether one likes it or not, Whose
	rebel cannot escape His accountability and punishment in any way;
	and Hakim signifies that whatever He does He does it wisely. His
	creation, His administration and rule, His commands and guidance,
	all are based on wisdom. None of His works is tarnished by any tract
	of folly or ignorance. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is
	another fine point here, which one should fully understand. Seldom
	in the Qur'an has Allah's attribute of `Aziz (All-Mighty) been
	accompanied by His attributes of being Qawi (Strong),
	Mugtadir(Powerful), Jabber (Omnipotent), Dhuntiqam (Avenger) and the
	like, which only signify His absolute power, and this has been so
	only in places where the context demanded that the wicked and
	disobedient be warned of Allah's relentless punishment. Apart from
	such few places, wherever the word 'Aziz has been used for Allah, it
	has everywhere been accompanied by one Or other of His attributes of
	being Hakim (Wise), Alim (Knower), Rahim (Merciful), Ghafur
	(Forgiving), Wahhab (Generous) and Hamid (Praiseworthy). The reason
	is that if a being who wields un-limited power is at the same time
	foolish, ignorant, un-forgiving as well as stingy and devoid of
	character, its power and authority cannot but lead to injustice and
	wickedness Thus, wherever injustice and wickedness is being
	committed in the world, it is only because the one who wields
	authority over Others, is either using his power un-wisely and
	foolishly, or he is merciless and hardhearted, or evil-minded and
	wicked. Wherever power is coupled with these evil traits of
	character, no good can be expected to result. That is why in the
	Holy Qur'an Allah's attribute of `Aziz has necessarily been
	accompanied by His attributes of being All-Wise and Knowing,
	Compassionate and Forgiving, Praiseworthy and Generous, so that man
	may know that the God Who is ruling this universe has, on the' one
	hand, such absolute power that no one, from the earth to the
	heavens, can prevent His decrees from being enforced, but, on the
	other, He is also AlI-Wise: His each decision is based on perfect
	wisdom; He is also AII-Knowing whatever decision He makes, it
	precisely according to knowledge; He is also Compassionate: He does
	not use infinite power mercilessly; He is Forgiving as well: He does
	not punish His creatures for trifling faults, but overlooks their
	errors; He is also Generous: He does not treat His subjects
	stingily, but liberally and benevolently; and He is also
	Praiseworthy: He combines in Himself all praiseworthy virtues and
	excellences. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The full
	importance of this statement of the Qur'an can be better understood
	by those people who are aware of the discussions of the philosophy
	of politics and law on the question of sovereignty. Sovereignty
	connotes that the one who possesses it should wield un-limited
	power: there should be no internal and external power to change or
	modify his decision or prevent it from being enforced, and none
	should have any alternative but to obey him. At the mere concept of
	this infinite and un-limited power, man's common-sense necessarily
	demands that whoever attains to such power, should be faultless and
	perfect in knowledge and wisdom, for if the one holding this power
	is ignorant, merciless and evil, his sovereignty will inevitably
	lead to wickedness and corruption. That is why the philosophers who
	regarded a single man, or a man-made institution, or an assembly of
	men as the holder of this power, have had to presume that he or it
	would be infallible. But obviously, neither can un limited
	sovereignty be actually attained by a human power, nor is it
	possible for a king, or a parliament, or a nation, or a party that
	it may use the sovereignty attained by it in a limited circle
	faultlessly and harmlessly. The reason is that the wisdom that is
	wholly free of every trace of folly, and the knowledge that fully
	comprehends all the related truths, is not at all possessed even by
	entire mankind, not to speak of its being attain d by an individual,
	or an institution, or a nation. Likewise, as long as man is man, his
	being wholly free of and above selfishness, sensuality, fear, greed,
	desires, prejudice and sentimental love, anger and hate is also not
	possible. If a person ponders over these truths, he will realize
	that the Qur'an is indeed presenting here a correct and perfect view
	of sovereignty. It says that no one except Allah in this universe is
	possessor of absolute power, and with this unlimited power He alone
	is faultless, All-Wise and All-Knowing, Compassionate and Forgiving,
	and Praiseworthy and Generous in His dealings with Hid subjects. &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote9sym" HREF="#sdfootnote9anc">9</A>This
	has two meanings and both are implied here. The first meaning is
	&quot;The wealth that you possess is not, in fact, your personal
	property but has been givers to you by Allah. You are not its
	exclusive master and owner. Allah has given you proprietary right
	over it as His vicegerent. Therefore, you should have no hesitation
	in spending it in the service of the real Master. It is not for the
	vicegerent to withhold the Master's wealth from being spent for the
	Master's own sake..&quot; The second: &quot;Neither bas this wealth
	been with you since ever nor will it remain in your possession for
	ever, Yesterday it was in some other people's possession; then Allah
	made you their successor and entrusted it to you, A time will come
	when it will not remain with you but some other people will succeed
	you as its owners, Therefore, in this short-lived ownership, when
	you are its trustees, spend it in the cause of Allah so that in the
	Hereafter You may be rewarded for it permanently and eternally. This
	same thing has been stated by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's
	peace) in a Hadith. Tirmidhi relates that once a goat was
	slaughtered in the Holy Prophet's house and its flesh was given away
	to the poor. When he came to the house and asked: &quot;What remains
	of the goat?&quot; Hadrat `A'ishah replied: &quot;Nothing but a
	shoulder.&quot; Thereupon the Holy Prophet remarked: &quot;Nay, the
	whole goat but the shoulder !&quot; That is, &quot;Whatever has been
	given away for the sake of Allah, has, in fact, been saved. &quot;
	According to another Hadith, a person asked: &quot;O Messenger of
	Allah, what kind of charity brings the highest reward? He replied:
	That you should give away a thing In charity when you are hale and
	hearty: when you feel it could be saved and may like to invest it in
	the hope of earning more. Do not wait till death when you may say:
	Give this to so and so and that to so and so, for at that time the
	wealth has in any case to pass on to so and so. &quot;(Bukhari,
	Muslim). According to still another Hadith, the Holy Prophet said:
	&quot;Man says: `My wealth! My wealth!' whereas his own share in his
	wealth is no more than what he has eaten up, or worn away, or passed
	on in charity? Whatever remains will leave him and will be passed on
	to others. &quot; (Muslim) &nbsp;

	is, &quot;Although both are entitled to the reward, yet the former
	are necessarily higher in rank than the latter, for they faced
	greater risks for the sake of Allah in difficult circumstances,
	which the latter not. They spent their wealth at a time when there
	appeared no remote chance of victory that would compensate for their
	expenditure, and they fought the disbelieves at a critical tune when
	there was an ever present apprehension that the enemy might
	overpower and crush the followers of Islam completely.&quot;
	Mujahid, Qatadah and Zaid bin Aslam, from among the commentators,
	say that the word &ldquo;victory&quot; in this verso has been used
	for the Conquest of Makkah, and `Amir Sha'bi says that it refers to
	the Truce of Hudaibiyah. The former view has been adopted by most of
	the commentators, and in support of the latter this tradition from
	Hadrat Abu Sa'id Khudri is presented: &quot;During the time when the
	Truce of Hudaibiyah was concluded, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) said to us: `In the near future there will appear the
	people, whose deeds will make you look upon your own deeds as mean
	and trifling, but even if one of them possessed a mountain of gold
	and he expended all of it in the cause of Allah, he would not attain
	to your spending two pounds, or even one pound of it.&quot; (Ibn
	Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Marduyah, Abu Nu'aim Isfahani). Further.
	more, it is also supported by the Hadith which Imam Ahmad has
	related on the authority of Hadrat Anas. He says: &quot;Once a
	dispute arose between Hadrat Khalid bin Walid and Hadrat `Abdur
	Rahman bin `Auf, in the course of which Hadrat Khalid said w Hadrat
	`Abdur Rahman: &quot;You people assume your superiority over us on
	account of your past services. ` When this thing came to the Holy
	Prophet's notice, he said: `By God in whose hand is my lift, even if
	you people spent gold equal (in weight) to Mount Uhud, or equal to
	other mountains, you would not attain to the deeds of these people.&quot;
	From this it is argued that in this verse &quot;victory&quot; refers
	to the Truce of Hudaibiyah, for Hadrat Khalid bin Walid had embraced
	Islam after this Truce and had participated in the Conquest of
	Makkah. However, whether &quot;victory&quot; in this particular case
	is taken to imply the Truce of Hudaibiyah or the Conquest of Makkah,
	in any case the verse does not mean that the distinction of the
	ranks is confined to this one victory alone, but as a general
	principle it shows that those who fight and spend in the cause of
	Islam at the time when disbelief and disbelievers appear to be
	dominant and Islam seems to have no remote chance of victory, are
	far superior in rank to those who make sacrifices after the conflict
	between Islam and paganism has been decided in favor of Islam.&quot;

	to a Hadith reported by Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas'ud, when this verse

	Messenger of Allah, does Allah want a loan from us?&rdquo; The Holy
	Prophet replied: &ldquo;Yes, O Abud-Dahdah,&rdquo; He said &ldquo;Kindly
	show me your hand.&rdquo; The Holy Prophet extended his hand towards
	him. He took his hand in his own hand and said: &ldquo;I give away
	my garden in loan to my Lord.&quot; Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud says
	that the garden had 600 date-palms and his own house also in which
	his family lived- Saying this to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) he went straight back home, and calling out to his
	wife said: &quot;Come out, O mother of Dahdah, I have loaned this
	garden to my Lord.&quot; She replied: &quot;Dahdah's father, you
	have made a good bargain!' and she immediately vacated and left the
	garden with her effects and children.&quot; (Ibn Abi Hatim). This

	that time, and from this one can also understand the kind of the

	it manifold with a rich reward in addition. &nbsp;

	The light there will be the light of righteous deeds. The sincerity

	into light that will lend brightness to the personality of the

	will be so .strong and sharp that it will be running on before him

	(most truthful) is the superlative from sidq; however, one should
	clearly understand that sidq Is not merely a statement conforming to
	the truth, but a statement which is not only true in itself but its
	Bayer also upholds it as a truth sincerely. For instance, if a
	person says that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)
	is Allah's Messenger, this is by itself precisely according to 'the
	truth for the Holy Prophet is truly Allah's Messenger, but the
	person would be true in his statement only if he also believed and
	upheld him as Allah's Messenger. Therefore, a thing would be sidq if
	what was said was in conformity with the truth as well as with the
	Bayer's own conscience. Likewise, sidq also contains the sense of
	faithfulness, sincerity and practical righteousness. Sadiq-ul-wa d
	would be the person who kept his promise practically, who never
	broke it. Sadiq (true friend) would be he who did full justice to
	friendship in the time of need, and who never proved faithless to
	any, body in any way. In war, sadiq fil-qital (true soldier) would
	be the one who fought with all his heart and body and established
	his valor practically. Thus, sidq in essence implies that one's deed
	should fully conform to one's word. The one who acts contrary to his
	word cannot be Sadiq. On that very basis, the one who preaches one
	thing and acts contrary to it, is regarded as a false preacher. With
	this meaning of sidq and sadiq in view one can fully appreciate the
	meaning of the superlative sadiq. It would inevitably imply a
	righteous person who is free from every impurity, who has never
	swerved from the truth and piety, who could never be expected to say
	anything against his conscience. who believed in whatever he
	believed with full sincerity and remained faithful to it under all
	circumstances, and who has practically proved that he is a true
	believer in the full sense of the word. (For further explanation,
	see E.N. 99 of An-Nisa).&nbsp;

	really falsehood clear instructions which told without any ambiguity

	indicate, like a balance, the golden mean between t40 extremes in
	matters of thought, morals and dealings. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	object for which the Prophets were sent with these three things was
	that man's conduct in the world and the system of human life,
	individually as well as collectively, should be established with
	justice. On the in hand, every man should precisely know the rights
	of God, the rights of his self and the rights of all . these people
	with whom we may have to deal in any way, and should fulfill them
	faithfully; and, on the other, the system of collective life should
	be built on such principles as should eliminate every kind of
	injustice from society, should safeguard every aspect of
	civilization and social life against extremism, should establish
	correct balance and equity in all spheres of collective life, so
	that all elements of society should receive their rights equitably
	and fulfill their obligations and duties responsibly. In other

	individual as well as collective justice They wanted to establish
	justice in the personal lift of each individual so as w bring about
	poise and equilibrium in his mind, his character, his conduct and
	his dealings. They also wanted to establish the whole system of

	They did not observe in the right spirit the restrictions that they
	had imposed upon themselves with a view to attain to Allah's
	goodwill, and conducted themselves in a way as to earn Allah's wrath
	instead of His good pleasure. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">To
	understand this theme fully we should have a look at the history of
	Christian Monasticism. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Until 200
	years after the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) the Christian
	Church knew no monasticism. Its germs, however, were found in
	Christianity from the very beginning. To look upon asceticism as a
	moral ideal and to regard celibacy as superior to matrimonial and
	mundane life is the basis of monasticism. Both these existed in
	Christianity from the beginning. Owing to the sanctification of
	celibacy in particular, it was considered undesirable for those the
	performed religious services in the church to marry, have children
	and be involved in domestic chores; so much so that by the 3rd
	century monasticism began to spread like an epidemic in
	Christiandom. Historically, it had three main causes!</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	sensuality, immorality and worship of the world had so permeated the
	ancient polytheistic society that in their zeal to counteract it the
	Christian scholars adopted the extremist way instead of the way of
	moderation. They so stressed chastity that the relationship between
	man and woman by itself came to be looked upon as filthy, even if it
	was within marriage. They reacted so violently to mammonism that to
	possess property of any kind ultimately was considered a sin for a
	religious person and to live like a poor man and ascetic the
	criterion of moral excellence. Likewise, in their reaction to the
	sensualism of the polytheistic society they touched the other
	extreme. They made withdrawal from pleasure and all material
	comforts, self denial and curbing of the desires the object of
	morality and regarded torturing the body by different sorts of harsh
	discipline as the climax and proof of a person's spirituality. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	when Christianity started achieving successes and spreading rapidly
	among the common people, the Church in its zeal to attract more and
	more adherents went on imbibing every evil that was prevalent in
	society. Thus, saint-worship replaced the ancient deities. Images of
	Christ and Mary began to be worshiped instead of the idols of Horus
	and Isis. Chrismas took the place of Saturnalia. Christian monks
	began to practice every kind of occult art like curing the sick by
	amulets and magic incantations, taking omens and fortune-telling,
	driving out spirits, etc. as were prevalent in ancient days.
	Likewise, since the common people looked upon a dirty and naked
	person who lived in a cave or den as a holy and godly man, this very
	concept of saintlihood became prevalent in the Christian Church, and
	legends of their miraculous powers began to abound in the memoirs of
	the Christian saints.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly,
	the Christians possessed no detailed law and definite traditions and
	practices to determine the bounds of religion. They had given up
	Mosaic Law and the Gospel by itself afforded no perfect code of
	guidance. Therefore, the Christian doctors went on permitting every
	kind of innovation to enter the religion partly under the influence
	of alien philosophies, customs and practices and partly under their
	personal preference and whim. Monasticism was one such innovation.
	Christian scholars and doctors of law took its philosophy and rules
	and practices from the Buddhist monks, Hindu Yogis and ascetics,
	Egyptian Anchorites, Iranian Manicheans, and the followers of Plato
	and Plotinus, and made the same the means ant methods of attaining
	self-purification, spiritual loftiness and nearness to Allah. Those
	who committed this error were not ordinary men. From the 3rd to the
	7th century (i.e.. till about the time the Qur'an began to be
	revealed) the religious personalities who were recognized as the
	foremost scholars and religious guides and leaders of Christendom,
	both in the East and in the West,-St. Athanasius, St. Basil, St.
	Gregory of Bazianzus, St. Chrysostom, St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, St.
	Augustine St. Benedict, St. Gregory the Great-all were monks
	themselves and great upholders of monasticism. It was under their
	influence that monasticism became popular in the Church. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Historically,
	monasticism among the Christians started from Egypt. Its founder was
	St. Anthony (A.D. 250 -350) who is regarded as the father of
	Christian Monasticism. He set up the first monastery at Pispir (now
	Der al Memum) in the Fayum. Later he established another monastery
	on the coast of the Rod Sea, which is now called Der Mar Antonius
	The basic cults of Christian Monasticism are derived from his
	writings and instructions. After this beginning the monastic
	movements spread like a f flood in Egypt and monasteries for monks
	and nuns were set up everywhere in the land in some of which lived
	three thousand monks at a time. In 325 another ascetic, pachomius,
	appeared in Egypt, who founded ten major monasteries and nunneries
	for the monks and nuns. The monastic movement then began to spread
	in Palestine and Syria and different countries of Africa and Europe.
	The Christian Church in the beginning experienced some confusion in
	connection with monasticism, for although it recognized abandonment
	of the world, celibacy and voluntary poverty as an ideal of
	spiritual life, yet it could not declare marriage, producing
	children and possessing property or money to be sinful as the monks
	did. Subsequently, under the influence of holy men like St.
	Athanasius (d. 373), St. Basil (d. 379), St. Augustine (d. 430) and
	Gregory the Great (d. 609) many of the monastic rules became part
	and parcel of the Church. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	monastic innovation has some characteristics which are briefly as
	follows: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Inflicting
	pain on the body by severe exercises and novel methods. In this
	thing every monk tried to surpass the other. The achievements of
	these holy men as related in the memoirs of the Christian saints are
	to this effect: St. Macarius of Alexandria constantly carried on
	himself a weight of 80 pounds. For six months he slept in a swamp
	while poisonous flies preyed on his naked body. His disciple, St.
	Eusebius, even surpassed his master in suffering severities and
	rigours. He moved about carrying a weight of 150 pounds, and lay in
	a dry well for three years. St. Saba ate the maize that would start
	stinking having. been soaked in water for a whole Month. St.
	Bassarion lay in thorny bushes for 40 days and did not rest his back
	on the ground for 40 years. St. Pachomius passed 15 years of his
	life, and according to another tradition 50 years, without rating
	his back on the round St. John remained standing in worship for
	three years during which he neither sat nor (ay down; he would only
	recline at times against a rock. His food consisted of the offering
	that was brought for him every Sunday. St. Simeon Styiltes (390-449)
	who is counted among the most illustrious Christian saints, used to
	observe an un-broken 40 days fast and smiling. Owing to such
	concepts the bond of marriage between man and woman came to be
	looked upon as filthy. A monk was forbidden even to look at a woman,
	not to speak of marriage, and was required to abandon his wife if he
	was married. As for men it was also impressed on the women that if
	they wished to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, they should shun
	marriage and remain spinsters and if they were married, they should
	separate from their husbands. St. Jerome, the distinguished
	Christian scholar, ruled that the woman who remained a spinster as a
	nun for the sake of Christ, was the bride of Christ, and her mother
	was the mother-in-law of Christ, i.e. God. Elsewhere St. Jerome
	says: &quot;To cut asunder the bond of marriage with the ax of
	chastity is the primary duty of the true devotee of God. &quot; The
	first impact these teachings had on a Christian man or Christian
	woman, under religious fervor, was that his or her married life was
	ruined. And since there was no provision for divorce or separation
	in Christianity, the husband and the wife would separate from each
	other while they remained bound in wed-lock. St. Nilus was father of
	two children. When he came under the spell of monasticism, he
	immediately separated from his wife. St. Ammon, on the first night
	of his marriage, gave his bride a sermon on the filthiness of the
	marriage bond and then the two between themselves decided to keep
	aloof from each other throughout life. St. Abraham abandoned his
	wife on the very first night of marriage. The same was done by St.
	Alexis. The memoirs of the Christian saints are full of such
	incidents. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Church continued to resist in one way or the other these extremist
	concepts for three centuries. In those days it was not required of a
	priest to be single and unmarried. If he was married before being
	appointed a minister, he could keep his wife. However, he was
	forbidden to marry after his appointment. Moreover, a person could
	not be appointed a minister if he had married a widow, or a divorced
	woman, or had two wives, or possessed a concubine. Gradually, by the
	4th century, the concept became firm that for a married person it
	was odious to perform religious services in the Church. The Council
	of Gengra (A.D. 362) was the last one in which such ideas wen held
	as anti-religious, but a little lour in 386, Roman Synod counseled
	the priests to avoid marriage relations and the following year Pope
	Siricius decreed that the priest who married, or continued to have
	sex relations with his wife if already married should be dismissed
	from office. Illustrious scholars like St. Ambrose, and St.
	Augustine upheld this decision most fervently, and after a little
	resistance it became fully enforced in the Western Church. In this
	period several councils were convened to consider the complaints to
	the effect that the people who were already marred were having
	&quot;illicit&quot; relations with their wives even after their
	appointment to perform religious duties. Consequently, with a view
	to reform them, rules were made to the effect that they should sleep
	in the open, should never meet their wives in private, and should
	meet them only in the presence of at (cast two other men. St.
	Gregory has made mention of a wonderful priest who did not have any
	relation with his wife for 40 years, and when the woman approached
	him at his death-bed, he rebuked her, saying: 'Woman. keep away !&quot;
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The most
	painful and pathetic chapter of ascetic monasticism is that it cut
	asunder man's relations with his parents, with his brothers and
	sisters, and even his children For the Christian saints love of the
	parents for son, love of the brothers and sisters for brother and
	love of the children for father also was sinful. They believed it
	was necessary for man to break off all those relations for the sake
	of spiritual progress. In the biographies of the Christian saints
	one comes across highly pathetic and heart-rending incidents. A
	monk, St. Evagrius, had been undergoing severe exercises in the
	desert for many years. Suddenly one day letters reached him from his
	father and mother, who were passing their days in great agony
	without him. The saint, fearing that the letters might arouse
	feelings of human love in his heart, cast the letters immediately
	into the fire, without even opening them. The mother and sister of
	St. Theodorus came to the monastery where he was staying, with
	recommendatory letters from many priests, and desired to have only a
	glimpse of him, but the saint refused to come out before them. St.
	Marcus' mother went to the monastery to sec him. She somehow
	obtained the abbot's permission for it and requested him to order
	her son to come out before her, but the son was adamant to her
	prayers. At last, be implemented the abbot's orders by appearing
	before his mother disguised and with closed eyes. Thus, neither was
	the mother able to recognize her son, nor the son saw his mother.
	Another saint, St. Poemen ant his six brothers lived in a desert
	monastery of Egypt. Years later their old mother came to know of
	their whereabouts and went to sec them in the monastery. As soon as
	the brothers saw their mother coming, they hurried into their cell
	and shut the door. The mother started crying and wailing outside
	saying: &quot;I have traveled in this old age from a distant place
	only to have a glimpse of you. There will be no harm if only I see
	you. Am I not your mother ?&quot; But the saints did not open the
	door and told the mother that they would meet her in the next world.
	Even more painful and piteous is the story of St. Simeon Stylites,
	who left his parents and remained away from them without any trace
	of his where abouts for 27 years. The father died of grief. When the
	fame of the son's piety and holiness spread the mother, who was
	still living in agony, came to know of his whereabouts. She came to
	the monastery to see him but women were not allowed to enter. She
	prayed that either the son should call her in, or he should himself
	conic out to let her have a glimpse of him, but &quot;the saint&quot;
	before Easter every year. Once he kept standing on one leg for a
	whole year. Often he would leave his monastery and retire to a well.
	Later he got a 60 foot high pillar erected near Antioch, which was
	three feet wide at the top and railed round. He spent the last 30
	years of his life on this pillar and remained permanently exposed to
	the elements. His disciples carried food to him by ladder and
	removed his filth. He had even tied himself to the pillar by a
	string, which cut into his flesh; when the flesh became rotten, it
	bred worms; whenever a worm fell out, he would restore it to the
	sore, saying: &quot;Eat what God has given you.&rdquo; Crowds of
	pilgrims flocked to him from far and near. When he died the
	Christian world proclaimed that he was the best model of a Christian
	saint. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	memoirs of the Christian saints of this period are full of such
	instances. One particular saint had the characteristic that he
	observed silence for 30 years: he was never seen speaking. Another
	had tied himself to a rock; another roamed the jungles and lived on
	grass; another moved about carrying a heavy load; another kept his
	limbs and body tied in fetters and chains; some saints lived in the
	dens of beasts, or in dry wells, or in old graves; and some others
	remained naked and concealed their private parts under long hair and
	would crawl on the ground. After death the bones of the illustrious
	saints were preserved in monastery. I saw a full library decked with
	such bones in St. Catherine's monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai.
	There were skulls and foot-bones and hand bones arranged separately.
	A glass-case contained the whole skeleton of a saint. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Their
	second characteristic was that they were dirty and strictly
	cleanliness and bodily care. Washing or applying water to the body
	was regarded as opposed to God-worship, for according to them
	purification of the body was tantamount to pollution of the soul.
	St. Athanasius has faithfully described this virtue of St. Anthony
	that he never washed his feet during life. St. Abraham from the day
	he entered Christianity neither washed his face nor feet for 50
	years. A famous nun Virgin Sylvia, never allowed any part of her
	body except the fingers to become wet with water throughout life It
	is said of 130 nuns of 8 convent that they never washed their feet
	and would shudder with horror at a mere reference to bath. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Monasticism
	practically forbade married life and ruthlessly discarded the
	institution of marriage. All religious writings of the 4th and 5th
	centuries are replete with the thought that celibacy is the highest
	moral virtue, and chastity meant that one should strictly abstain
	from sexual relation even if it was between husband and wife. The
	perfection of a pure spiritual life lay in complete self-denial,
	with no desire for physical pleasure. It was . necessary to suppress
	any carnal desire because it strengthened animality. For them
	pleasure and sin were synonymous so much so that being happy was
	regarded as being forgetful of God. St. Basil forbade even laughing
	refused to oblige her. The woman lay at the entrance for three days
	and three nights and at last breathed her last in the same state.
	Then the holy man emerged from his seclusion, mourned his mother's
	death and prayed for her forgiveness.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	same harsh way these saints treated their sisters and children.
	There is the story of Mutius, a prosperous man by all means. Drawn
	out suddenly by the religious impulse, he took his 8-year-old son
	and went to a monastery. But for the sake of his progress to
	holiness it was necessary that he should give up love of his son.
	Therefore, first the son was separated from him Then the innocent
	child was subjected to harsh treatment before his very eyes and he
	watched it patiently. Then, the abbot of the monastery ordered him
	to go and Cast the child into the river. He became ready even for
	this; then right at the time when he was going to throw the child
	into the river, the monks saved the child's life. then it was
	admitted that he had actually attained to the rank of a holy man. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	viewpoint of Christian monasticism in these matters was that the one
	who sought love of God, should break off all relations of human love
	that bound him in the world to his parents, his brothers and sisters
	and his children. St. Jerome says, &quot;Even if your nephew clings
	to you with his hands round your neck; even if your mother calls you
	back in the name of having suckled you; even if your father
	obstructs your way and lies down before you, you should hasten out
	to the banner of the cross, trampling the body of your father,
	without shedding a tear. Ruthlessness in this mater is piety
	itself.&quot; St. Gregory writes, &quot;A young monk who could not
	give up love of his parents, left the monastery one night in order
	to pay them a visit. God punished him for this error, for as soon as
	he returned to the monastery, he died. His body was buried in the
	grave but the earth did not accept it. He was placed in the grave
	again and again, and the earth threw him out every time. At last,
	St. Benedict placed a sacred offering on his chest, and then the
	grave accepted him.&quot; Of a nun it is said that for three days
	after her death, she remained subject to a torment because she had
	not been able to cleanse her heart of her mother's lout. About a
	saint it is written that he never treated anyone harshly except his
	relatives. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Their
	practice of meting out ruthless, cruel and harsh treatment to their
	nearest relatives, made their human feeling dead, with the result
	that they would treat with utmost enmity those with whom they had
	any religious differences. By the beginning of the 4th century, 80
	to 90 religious sects had arisen in Christianity. St. Augustine has
	made mention of 88 sects of his own time, each of which regarded the
	other with extreme hatred. And the fire of this hatred also was
	fanned by the monks, who were always in the forefront to hahtt and
	destroy the opponent sects by their machinations. Alexandria was a
	great center of this sectarian conflict. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There, in
	the beginning the Bishop of the Arian sect attacked the Athanasius
	party. Virgin nuns were dragged out of their convents, stripped
	naked and beaten with thorny branches and branded in order to make
	them give up their creed. Then, when the Roman Catholics came to
	power in Egypt, they treated the Arian' sect likewise; so much so
	that according to the prevalent view Arius himself also was
	poisoned. Once on the same city of Alexandria the monks of St.'
	Cyril created a turmoil They seized a nun of the opponent sect and
	took her into their church; they killed her, backed her body to
	pieces, and cast it into the fire. Rome was not any different from
	this. In 366, at the death of Pope Liberius, two sects nominated
	their respective candidates for papacy; this resulted in great
	bloodshed; so much so that in one day 137 dead bodies were taken out
	from one church. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Side by
	side with this retreat from the world and life of seclusion and
	poverty, wealth of the world also was amassed most avariciously. By
	the beginning of the 5th century the condition was that the bishop
	of Rome lived in his palace like kings, and when his conveyance
	emerged in the city, it would be as stately and splendid as of the
	emperor himself. St. Jerome complains of the conditions of his time
	(later part of the 4th century) saying that the feast hosted by many
	of the bishops out-classed the feasts of the governors. The flow of
	wealth to monasteries and churches had assumed the proportions of a
	deluge by the beginning of the 7th century (the age of the
	revelation of the Qur'an). It had been deeply impressed on the minds
	that a person who happened to commit a grave sin could be redeemed
	only by making an offering at a saint's shrine, or a sacrifice at
	the altar of a church or monastery. Then the same world and its
	luxuries and comforts abstention from which was the mark of
	distinction of the monks, lay at their feet. The factor which, in
	particular, caused this decline was that when the common people
	developed extreme reverence for the monks because of their
	undergoing severe exercises of self-discipline and self-denial,
	hosts of world seeking people also donned the monk's garments and
	entered their ranks. Then under the garb of feigned poverty they
	turned acquisition of worldly wealth and possessions into a
	flourishing business. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	matter of chastity also monasticism was repeatedly defeated in its
	fight against nature and defeated well and proper. In the
	monasteries some exercises of self-mortification were such as
	required the monks and nuns to live together in one and the same
	place, and they had often to pass the night in the same bed in their
	enthusiasm for more and more temptations. St. Evagarius, the
	well-known monk, has praised the self-control acquired by the
	Palestinian monks, saying: &quot;They had mastered their passion so
	completely that although they bathed with the women together, looked
	at their bodice, touched them, even embraced them, yet they remained
	invincible to nature.&quot; Although bathing was an odious thing in
	monasticism, such baths were also taken for the sake of exercise in
	self-control. At last, about the same Palestine, St. Gregory of
	Nyssa (d. 396) writes that it bas become a center of wickedness and
	immorality. Human nature avenges itself on those who fight it.
	Monasticism fought it and ultimately fell in the pit of immorality
	the story of which is a most shameful blot on the religious history
	of the 8th to 11th centuries. An Italian bishop of the 10th century
	writes: &quot;If the penal law for misconduct is practically
	enforced against those who perform religious services in the church,
	none would escape punishment except the boys, and if the law to
	remove illegitimate children from religious services was also
	enforced, there might perhaps be left no boy among the attendants of
	the church. &quot; Books of the medieval authors are replete with
	the complaints that the nunneries had become houses of prostitution.
	Within their four walls newborn babies were being massacred; the
	priests and religious attendants of the church had developed illicit
	connections even with forbidden relatives; the crime of the
	unnatural act had spread like an epidemic in the monasteries; and
	the practice of confession had become a means of immorality in the
	churches. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From
	these details one can fully appreciate what corruption of
	Christianity is the Qur'an alluding to when it says: &quot;The
	Christians themselves invented monasticism, but they did not observe
	it as it should have been observed.&quot;

	commentators differ in the explanation of this verse, One group says
	that the address here is directed to the people who believed in the
	Prophet Jesus. It is being said to them, &quot;Believe in the Holy
	Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) now; for
	this you will be given a double reward, one reward for believing in
	the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him) and the other reward for
	believing in the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and

	being addressed. They are being admonished to the effect: &quot;Do
	not rest content with your verbal affirmation of the Faith only, but
	you should believe sincerely and truly For this you will be given .
	a double reward: one reward for giving up disbelief and turning to
	Islam, and the second reward for believing sincerely in Islam and
	remaining steadfast to it. &quot;The first commentary is supported
	by vv. 52-S4 of Surah AI-Qasas, and furthermore by the tradition
	reported by Hadrat Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, according to which the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: &quot;There are three men who

	by verse 37 of Surah Saba, which says that the righteous believers
	will have a double reward. From the point of view of argument both
	the commentaries are equally weighty. However, considering the theme
	that follows, one feels that the second commentary is more in
	keeping with the context here; and in fact the whole theme of this
	Surah, from beginning to end, supports this very commentary. From
	the beginning of this Surah- the addressees are the people who had
	entered Islam after affirming the Prophethood of the Holy Prophet
	and it is they whom the Surah invites to believe sincerely and truly
