theme is to warn the disbelievers of the evil consequences of the
persecution and tyranny that they were perpetrating on the converts
to Islam, and to console the believers, so as to say: &quot;If you

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">In
this connection, first of all the story of the people of the ditch

had been related, who had burnt the believers to death by casting
them into pits full of fire. By means of this story the believers and
the disbelievers have been taught a few lessons. First, that just as
the people of the ditch became worthy of Allah's curse and
punishment, so are the chiefs of Makkah also becoming worthy of it.
Second, that just as the believers at that time had willingly
accepted to sacrifice their lives by being burnt to death in the pits
of fire instead of turning away from the faith, so also the believers
now should endure every persecution but should never give up the
faith. Third, that Gods acknowledging Whom displeases the
disbelievers and is urged on by the believers, is Dominant and Master
of the Kingdom of the earth and heavens; He is self-praiseworthy and
is watching what the two groups are striving for. Therefore, it is
certain that the disbelievers will not only be punished in Hell for
their disbelief but, more than that, they too will suffer punishment
by fire as a fit recompense for their tyranny and cruelties.
Likewise, this also is certain that those, who believe and follow up
their belief with good deeds, should go to Paradise and this indeed
is the supreme success. Then the disbelievers have been warned, so as
to say: &quot;God's grip is very severe. If you are proud of the
strength of your hosts, you should know that the hosts of Pharaoh and
Thamud were even stronger and more numerous. Therefore, you should
learn a lesson from the fate they met. God's power has so encompassed
you that you cannot escape His encirclement, and the Qur'an that you
are bent upon belying, is unchangeable: it is inscribed in the
Preserved Tablet, which cannot be corrupted in any way.&quot; </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

	people of the ditch&quot;: those who had burnt the believers at
	stake and witnessed their burning themselves. &quot;Doomed were...&quot;:
	cursed were they by God and they became worthy of Hell torment. On

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The first
	of these testifies to the truth that the Sovereign, Absolute Being
	Who is ruling over the glorious stars and planets of the universe,
	cannot allow this contemptible, insignificant creature called man to

	come when the grievances of every wronged person will be redressed
	and every wrongdoer will be brought to book and punished. The third
	thing has been sworn by for the reason that just as these wicked
	people enjoyed witnessing the burning of the helpless believers, so
	will all human beings on the Day of Resurrection witness how they
	are taken to task and burnt in Hell. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Several
	events have been mentioned in the traditions of the believers having
	been thrown into pits of blazing fire, which show that such
	tyrannies have been inflicted many a time in history. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One of
	the events has beets reported by Hadrat Suhaib Rumi from the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace), saying that a king had a magician at
	his court who cm becoming old requested the king to appoint a boy
	who should learn magic from him. Accordingly the king appointed a
	boy. But the boy while going to the magician's place and coming hack
	home also started visiting on the way a monk (who was probably a
	follower of the Prophet Jesus) and being influenced by his teaching
	turned a believer. So much so that by his training he acquired
	miraculous powers. He would heal the blind and cure the lepers. When
	the king came to know that the boy had behaved in the Unity of God,
	he first put the monk to the sword: the+ wanted to kill the boy, but
	no instrument and no device had any effect on him. At last, the boy
	said to the king: &quot;If you are bent upon killing me, shoot an
	arrow at me with the word: Bi-ismi Rahhil-ghulam (in the name of
	this boy's Lord) in front of the assembled people. and I shall die.&quot;
	The king did as he was told and the boy died. There upon the people
	cried out that they affirmed faith in the Lord of the boy. The
	courtiers told the king that the same precisely had happened which
	Ire wanted to avoid: the people had forsaken his religion and
	adopted the boy's religion. At this the king was filled with rage.
	Consequently, hr got pits dug out along the roads, got them tilled
	with tire and ordered all those who refused to renounce the new
	faith to he thrown into the tire. (Ahmad, Muslim. Nasa'i, TIrmidhi,
	Ibn Jarir. 'Abdur Razzaq. Ibn Abi Shaibah, Tabarani. 'Ahd hin
	Humaid) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second event has been reported from Hadrat 'Ali. He says that a king
	of lean drank wine and committed adultery with his sister resulting
	in illicit relations between the two. When the secret became known,
	the king got the announcement made that God had permitted marriage
	with the sister. When the people refused to believe in it, hr
	started coercing them into accepting by different kinds of
	punishment; so much so that he began to cast into the pits of fire
	every such person who refused to concede it. According to Hadrat
	'AIi, marriage with the prohibited relations among the fire
	worshipers has begun since then (Ibn Jarir). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	event has been related by lbn 'Abbas probably on the hasin of the
	Israelite traditions, saying that the people of Babylon had
	compelled the children of Israel to give up the religion of the
	Prophet Moses (peace he upon himl: so much so that they cast into
	pits of tire all those who refused to obey. Ibn Jarir, 'Ahd bin
	Humaid). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The best
	known event, how ever, relates to Najran. which has been related by
	Ibn Hisham, Tabari. Ibn Khaldun. the author of Mujam al-Buldan and
	other Islamic historians. Its resume is as follows: Tuban Asad Abu
	Karib, king of Himyar (Yaman), went to Yathrib once where he
	embraced Judaism under the influence of the Jews, and brought two of
	the Jewish scholars of Bani Quraizah with him to Yaman. There hr
	propagated Judaism widely. His son Dhu Nuwas succeeded him and hr
	attacked Najran which was a stronghold of the Christians in southern
	Arabia so as to eliminate Christianity and make the people accept
	Judaism. Ibn Hisham says that these people were true followers of
	the Gospel of the Prophet Jesus) In Najran hr invited the people to
	accept Judaism but they refused to obey. There upon hr caused a
	large number of the people to he burnt in the ditches of fire and
	slew many others with the sword until he had killed nearly twenty
	thousand of them. Daus Dhu Tha laban an inhabitant of Najran escaped
	and went. according to one tradition. to the Byzantine emperor, and
	according to another. to the Negus king of Abyssinia, and told him
	what had happened 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to the first tradition, the emperor wrote to the king of Abyssinia,
	and according to the second, the Negus requested the emperor to
	provide him with a naval force. In any case; an Abyssinian army
	consisting of seventy thousand soldiers under a general called
	Aryat, attacked Yaman, Dhu Nuwas was killed, the Jewish rule came to
	an end, and Yaman become a part of the Christian kingdom of
	Abyssinia.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	statements of the Islamic historians are not only confirmed by other
	historical means but they also give many more details. Yaman first
	came under the Christian Abyssinian domination in 340 A.D. and this
	domination continued till 378 A.D. The Christian missionaries
	started entering Yaman in that period. About the same time, a man
	named Faymiyun (Phemion), who was a righteous, earnest, ascetic man
	and possessed miraculous powers, arrived in Yaman and by his
	preaching against idol-worship converted the people of Najran to
	Christianity. These people were ruled by three chiefs: Sayyid, who
	was the principal chief like the tribal elders and responsible for
	external affairs, political agreements and command of the forces,
	'Aqib, who looked after the internal affairs and Usquf (Bishop), the
	religious guide. In southern Arabia Najran commanded great
	importance, being a major trade and industrial center with tussore,
	leather and the armament industries. The well-known Yarnanite
	wrapper and cloak (hulls Yamani) was also manufactured here. On this
	very basis, Dhu Nuwas attacked this important place not only for
	religious but also for political and economic reasons. He put to
	death Harithah (called Arethas by the Syrian historians), Sayyid of
	Najrain, killed his two daughters in front of his wife Romah and
	compelled her to drink their blood and then put even her to death.
	He took out the bones of Bishop Paul from the' grave and burns them,
	and ordered women, men, children, aged people, priests and monks,
	all to be thrown into the pits of fire. The total number of the
	people thus killed has been estimated between twenty and forty
	thousand. This happened in October, 523 A.D. At last, in 525 A.D.
	the Abyssinians attacked Yaman and put an end to Dhu Nuwas and his
	Himyarite kingdom. This is confirmed by the Hisn Ghurab inscription
	which the modern archaeologists have unearthed in Yaman.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In
	several Christian writings of the 6th century A.D. details of the
	event relating to the people of the ditch&quot; have been given,
	some of which are contemporary and reported from eye-witnesses.
	Authors of three of these books were contemporaries with the event.
	They were Procopeus, Cosmos Indicopleustis, who was translating
	Greek book of Ptolemy under command of the Negus Elesboan at that
	time and resided at Adolis, a city on the sea-coast of Abyssinia,
	and Johannes Malala froth whom several of the later historians have
	related this event. After this, Johannes of Ephesus (d. 585 A.D) has
	related the story of the persecution of the Christians of Najran in
	his history of the Church from a letter of Bishop Mar Simeon who was
	a contemporary reporter of this event. Mar Simeon wrote this letter
	to Abbot von Gabula; in it Simeon has reported this event with
	reference to the statements of the Yarnanite eye-witnesses present
	on the occasion. This letter was published in 1881 A.D from Rome and
	in 1890 A.D. in the memoirs of the martyrs of Christianity Jacobian
	Patriarch Dionysius and Zacharia of Mitylene have in their Syriac
	histories also related this event. Ya`qub Saruji also in his book
	about the Christians of Najran has made mention of it. Bishop Pulus
	of Edessa's elegy on those who perished in Najran, is still extant.
	An English translation of the Syriac kitab al-Himyarin (Book of the
	Himyarites) was published in 1924 from London, which confirms the
	statements of the Muslim historians. In the British Museum there are
	some Abyssinian manuscripts relating to that period or a period
	close to it, which support this story. Philby in his travelogue
	entitled &quot;Arabian Highlands&quot;, writes: Among the people of
	Najran the place is still well known where the event of the people
	of the ditch (ashab al-ukhdud) had taken place. Close by Umm Kharaq
	there can still be seen some pictures carved in the rocks, and the
	present day people of Najran also know the place where the cathedral
	of Najran stood.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Abyssinian Christians after capturing Najran had built a church here
	resembling the Ka`bah, by which they wanted to divert pilgrimage
	from the Ka`bah at Makkah to it. Its priests and keepers wore
	turbans and regarded it as a sacred sanctuary. The Roman empire also
	sent monetary aid for this &quot;ka`bah&quot;. The priests of this
	very &quot;Ka`bah&quot; of Najran had visited the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be Allah's peace and blessings) under the leadership of their
	Sayyid, `Aqib and Bishop for a discussion with him and the famous
	event of the mubahala (trial through prayer) took place as referred
	to in Al-Imran: 61. (For details. see E.N.'s 29 and 55 of Al-Imran)&nbsp;
