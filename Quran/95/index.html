Obviously, if it had been revealed at Madinah, it would not be
correct to use the words &quot;this city&quot; for Makkah Besides, a
study of the contents of the Surah shows that it belongs to the
earliest period of Makkah, for in it there is no sign whatever to
indicate that during the period of its revelation any conflict had
started between Islam and unbelief. Moreover, it reflects the same
style of the earliest revelations of Makkah period in which briefly
and succinctly the people have been made to realize that the judgment
of the Hereafter is necessary and absolutely rational. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Its
theme is the rewards and punishments of the Hereafter. For this
purpose first swearing an oath by the habitats of some illustrious
Prophets, it has been stated that Allah has created man in the most
excellent of molds. Although at other places in the Quran, this truth
has been expressed in different ways, for example, at some places it
has been said: &quot;Allah appointed man His vicegerent on the earth
and commanded the angels to bow down to him (Al-Baqarah: 30,34,
Al-Anam: 165, Al-Araf: 11, Al-Hijr 28,29, An-Naml: 62, Suad 71- 73);&quot;
at others that: &quot;Man has become bearer of the Divine trust,
which the earth and the heavens and the mountains did not have the
power to bear (Al-Ahzab 72);&quot; and at still others that: &quot;We
honored the children of Adam and exalted them above many of Our other
creatures (Bani Israil 70),&quot; yet here the statement made on oath
in particular by the habitats of the Prophets that man has been
created in the finest of molds, signifies that mankind has been
blessed with such an excellent mold and nature that it gave birth to
men capable of attaining to the highest position of Prophethood, a
higher position than which has not been attained by any other
creature of God. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
it has been stated that there are two kinds of men. those who in
spite of having been created in the finest of molds, become inclined
to evil and their moral degeneration causes them to be reduced to the
lowest of the low, and those who by adopting the way of faith and
righteousness remain secure from the degeneration and consistent with
the noble position, which is the necessary demand of their having
been created in the best of molds. The existence among mankind of
both these kinds of men is such a factual thing which no one can
deny, for it is being observed and experienced in society everywhere
at all times. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, this factual reality has been used as an argument to
prove that when among the people there are these two separate and
quite distinct kinds, how can one deny the judgment and retribution
for deeds If the morally degraded are not punished and the morally
pure and exalted are not rewarded and both end in the dust alike, it
would mean that there is no justice in the Kingdom of God; whereas
human nature and common sense demand that a judge should do justice.
How then can one conceive that Allah, Who is the most just of all
judges, would not do justice? </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>There
	has been much difference of opinion among the commentators about the
	explanation of this verse. Hasan Basri. `Ikrimah, `Ata' bin Abi
	Rabah, Jabir bin Zaid, Mujahid and Ibrahim Nakha'i (may Allah bless
	them all) say that the fig implies the same fig which the people
	eat, and the olive the same which produces oil. Ibn Abi Hatim and
	Hakim have cited a statement from Ha 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also in
	support of this. And the commentators who have accepted this
	explanation have, in view of the uses and virtues of the fig and the
	olive, expressed the opinion that Allah has sworn by these two
	fruits because of these very qualities. There is no doubt that the
	Arabic reader would understand the words do and zayun in the same
	meaning as are their well known meanings in Arabic, yet there are
	two reasons for which these meanings cannot be accepted. First, that
	in the subsequent verses, oaths have been sworn by the Mount Sinai
	and the City of Makkah, and there seems to be no relevance between
	the oaths sworn by the two fruits and the oaths by the two places.
	Second, the theme that follows the oaths is borne out by the Mt.
	Sinai and the City of Makkah but not by the two fruits. Wherever in
	the Qur'an Allah has sworn by something, He has not sworn by it
	because of its glory or its uses and benefits but every oath has
	relevance to the theme that follows it. Therefore, the virtues and
	qualities of these two fruits cannot be regarded as the reason for
	swearing the oath by them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	other commentators have taken tin and zaytun to imply some places.
	Ka`b Abhar, Qatadah an Ibn Zaid say that tin implies Damascus and
	zaytun Bait al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). A view of Ibn 'Abbas has been
	cited by Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Marduyah to the effect
	that tin implies the mosque of the Prophet Noah, which he built on
	Mt. Judi, and zaytun implies Bait al-Maqdis, but hearing the words
	wat-tin waz-zaytin, no ordinary Arab could think of these meanings,
	nor was it well known among the Arabs, who were the first addressees
	of the Qur'an that ain and zaytun were names of the places. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">However,
	there was a practice among the people of Arabia that they generally
	named a land where a certain fruit was produced in plenty after the
	name of the fruit itself. Accordingly, the meaning. Of tin and
	zaytun can be the land where these fruits are grown, and it is the
	land of Syria and Palestine, for among the Arabs of that period this
	very land was well known for the production of fig and olive. lbn
	Taimiyah, Ibn al-Qayyim, zamakhshari and Alusi (may Allah show them
	mercy) have adopted this very explanation; and although Ibn Jarir
	also has preferred the first view, yet he has conceded that ain and
	zaytun may also imply the land where these fruits are grown. Hafiz
	Ibn Kathir also has regarded this explanation as worthy of
	consideration. &nbsp;

	words in the original are Tur- i-Sinin. Sinin is another name for
	the Sinai Peninsula. It is called Sama or Sina as well as Sinin. In
	the Qur'an itself at one place the words Tur-i-Sinin. have been
	used. Since the land in which Mt. Sinai is located is well known as
	Sina, we have adopted this well known name in the translation.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>This
	is the truth for which the oath has been sworn by the lands of the
	fig and the olive (i.e. Syria and Palestine) and Mt. Sinai and
	Makkah, the city of peace. Man's having been created in the most
	excellent of molds means that he has been given the finest body
	which no other living being has been given, and he has been blessed
	with the noblest faculties of thought, knowledge and intellect which
	no other creature has been blessed with. Then, since the most
	sublime model these excellencies and . unique merits of mankind's
	are the Prophets (upon whom be Allah's peace), and no creation can
	have a higher rank than they, so that Allah may choose it for
	appointment to the office of Prophethood, an oath has been sworn by
	the places associated with the Prophets of God to bear testimony to
	man's having been created in the finest of molds. The land of Syria
	and Palestine is the land where a large number of Prophets, from the
	Prophet Abraham (peace be upon him) to the Prophet Jesus (peace be
	upon him), were raised. Mt. Tur is the place where the Prophet Moses
	was blessed with Prophethood. As for Makkah, it was founded by the
	Prophets Abraham and Ishmael themselves. It was on account of their
	association with it that ' it became the holiest central place of
	Arabia. It was the Prophet Abraham who had prayed: &quot;O my Lord,
	make this city a city of peace and security.&quot; (Al-Baqarah:
	126); and it was because of this prayer that in the midst of chaos
	and confusion prevailing everywhere in Arabia only this city
	continued to remain an island of peace for some 2500 years or more.
	Thus, the verse means to say: &quot;We created mankind in such an
	excellent mold that it produced men who attained to the most sublime
	rank of Prophethood.&quot;&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote4">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>The
	commentators in general have given two meanings of this: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	We reversed him to the miserable state of old age in which he was no
	longer able to think and understand and work; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	We reversed him to the lowest stage of Hell. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But these
	two meanings cannot be an argument for the object for the
	confirmation of which this Surah was revealed. The Surah is meant to
	reason out the truth of the judgment in the Hereafter. On this,
	neither has this tact any bearing that some human beings are caused
	to reach the most miserable state of old age, nor that a section of
	human beings will be cast into Hell. The first thing cannot be an
	argument for the judgment because old age comes upon both the good
	and the bad people, and a person's reaching this age is no
	punishment which he might suffer in consequence of his deeds. As for
	the second thing, it will occur in the Hereafter. It cannot be
	presented as an argument before the people who are being convinced
	of the meting out of rewards and punishments in the Hereafter
	itself. Therefore in our opinion the correct meaning of the verse
	is: After having been created in the finest of molds when man uses
	the powers of his body and mind in evil ways Allah grants him the
	power to do only evil and causes him to reach the lowest ebb of
	degradation. This is a truth which one commonly observes in human
	society. People become so overwhelmed by greed, selfishness,
	lustfulness, addiction to intoxicants, meanness, rage and fury and
	such other traits that morally they are actually reduced to the
	lowest of the low. Consider only one example: When a nation is
	blinded by its hostility to another country it surpasses all savage
	beasts in barbarity. A wild beast preys upon its victim only for the
	sake of food, it does not resort to a general massacre; but man
	resorts to massacre of his own kind. The beast only uses its claws
	and teeth but man who has been created in the best of molds invents
	the gun, rifle, tank, aircraft, atom and hydrogen bombs and
	countless other weapons by his intellect so that he can instantly
	destroy whole populations. The beast only kills or inflicts a wound
	but man invents such painful methods of torturing men like himself
	as cannot even be -imagined by a' beast. Then to wreak his vengeance
	and fury on his enemies he forces the women to march out in naked
	processions: they are subjected to rape by tens and twenties of men;
	they are dishonored before the eyes of their fathers, brothers and
	husbands; children are massacred in front of their parents; mothers
	are forced to drink their children's blood; human beings are burnt
	and buried alive. There is no wild species of animals in the world
	which may equal this human barbarity in any degree. The same is also
	the case with other evil traits: man proves himself to he the lowest
	of the low in whichever evil he indulges. So much so that he
	degrades even religion which is the most sacred thing for man: he
	worships the trees, animals and mountains, even the sex organs of
	man and woman; he keeps religious prostitutes in the places of
	worship to win the goodwill of the gods and commits adultery with
	them as an act of virtue. In his mythology he attributes such filthy
	tales to his gods and goddesses which would make the most wretched
	beast to hang his head in shame.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote5">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>The
	commentators who have taken asfala safilin to imply the state of
	extreme old age when man loses his sense and reason, interpret this
	verse to mean: &quot;But the people who in the prime and strength of
	their age believed and did righteous deeds would have in this old
	age too the same righteous deeds credited for them and will be
	rewarded accordingly. No reduction will be made in their rewards on
	the ground that they could not perform those righteous deeds in that
	period of Iife&quot;. And the commentators who construe reversal to
	safilin to imply being cast into the lowest stage of Hell interpret
	this verse to mean: &quot;the people also believed and did righteous
	deeds are an exception: they will not be reversed to this stage but
	they will have a reward unending and unfailing.&quot; But, neither
	of these meanings is relevant to the reasoning made in this Surah to
	justify the judgment of the Hereafter. In our opinion the verse
	means: &quot;Just as it is a common observation in human society
	that the morally degraded are made the lowest of the low, so this
	also is an observation of every age that those who believed in God,
	the Hereafter and the Prophethood and who molded their lives after
	righteousness and piety, remained secure from this degeneration and
	remained consistent with the best mold and nature that Allah had
	created them on. Therefore, they are worthy of the unending reward,
	i.e. the reward which will neither be less than what they deserve,
	nor will it ever be cut off. &quot;&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote6sym" HREF="#sdfootnote6anc">6</A>Another

	make you deny the judgment ?&quot; In both cases the intention and
	purpose remains the same. That is when it is a common observation in
	human society that a section of mankind which has been created in
	the best of molds and nature, is rendered lowest of the low because
	of moral degradation, and the other section remains secure by
	adopting the path of constant faith and righteousness in view of its
	being created in the best of molds and nature how can judgment be
	denied after this ? Does common sense require that the end of both
	these men be the same? Does justice demand that neither those who
	are reduced to the lowest of the low be punished nor those who
	strive to adopt a righteous life be rewarded ? The same theme has
	been expressed at other places in the Qur'an thus: &quot;Shall We
	then treat the obedient as We treat the culprits? What has happened
	to you: how ill you judge?&quot; (AI-Qalam: 35, 36). &quot;Do those
	who have committed evil think that We shall hold them and those who
	have believed and done righteous deeds as equal so that their life
	and their death should be alike ? Ill are the judgments they pass!&quot;
	(Al-Jathiyah 21).&nbsp;

	Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ud, Ibn al-Mundhir, Baihaqi, Hakim and Ibn
	Marduyah have related, on the authority of Hadrat Abu Hurairah, that
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: &quot;When one of you
	recites Surah Wat-tin waz-zaytun and reaches Alais-Allah-u
	bi-ahkam-il-Hakimin he should respond to it, saying: Bata wa ana ala
	dhalika min-ash-shahidin (Yes, and I am of those who bear witness to
	it). According to some other traditions, the Holy Prophet responded
	with Subhanaka fa-bald when he recited this verse.
