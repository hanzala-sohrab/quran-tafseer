<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
is the first of those Surahs which were sent down in the third stage
of Prophethood at Makkah. We have already divided the life of the
Holy Prophet at Makkah into four stages in the Introduction to
Chapter VI. According to that division the third stage lasted from
the fifth to the tenth year of Prophethood. What distinguishes this
stage from the second and the fourth stages is this. During the
second stage the Quraish mainly resorted to ridiculing, scoffing,
threatening, tempting, raising objections and making false propaganda
against the Holy Prophet and his followers in order to suppress the
Islamic Movement. But during the third stage they employed the
weapons of persecution, man handling and economic pressure for the
same purpose. So much so that a large number of the Muslims had to
emigrate from Arabia to Habash, and those who remained behind were
besieged in Shi'ib Abi Talib along with the Holy Prophet and his
family. To add to their misery, a complete social and economic
boycott was applied against them. The only redeeming feature was that
there were two personalities, Abu Talib and Hadrat Khadijah, whose
personal influence had been conducive to the support of two great
families of the Quraish. However, when in the tenth year of
Prophethood these two persons died, the fourth stage began with such
revere persecutions as forced the Holy Prophet and all his Companions
to emigrate from Makkah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

people of the Book, had put to the Holy Prophet in order to test him.
These were: (1) Who were &quot;the Sleepers of' the Cave&quot;? (2)
What is the real story of Khidr? and (3) What do you know about
Zul-Qarnain? As these three questions and the stories involved
concerned the history of the Christians and the Jews, and were
unknown in Hijaz, a choice of these was made to test whether the Holy
Prophet possessed any source of the knowledge of the hidden and
unseen things. Allah, however, not only gave a complete answer to
their questions but also employed the three stories to the
disadvantage of the opponents of Islam in the conflict that was going
on at that time at Makkah between Islam and un-belief: </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

	Quran and that their condition was similar to the condition of the
	persecuted Muslims of Makkah. On the other hand, the persecutors of
	the Sleepers of the Cave had behaved in the same way towards them as
	the disbelievers of the Quraish were behaving towards the Muslims.
	Besides this, the Muslims have been taught that even if a Believer
	is persecuted by a cruel society, he should not bow down before
	falsehood but emigrate from the place all alone, if need be, with
	trust in God. Incidentally the disbelievers of Makkah were told that
	the story of the Sleepers of the Cave was a clear proof of the creed
	of the Hereafter, for this showed that Allah has the power to
	resurrect anyone He wills even after a long sleep of death as He did
	in case of the Sleepers of the Cave. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

	that he should in no case make a compromise with their persecutors
	nor should he consider them to be more important than his poor
	followers. On the other hand, those chiefs have been admonished that
	they should not be puffed up with the transitory life of pleasure

	reality is hidden from you, you are at a loss to understand the

	The fact is that if the curtain be removed from the &quot;unseen&quot;,

	should learn a lesson from Zul-Qarnain. Though he was a great ruler,
	a great conqueror and the owner of great resources, yet he always
	surrendered to his Creator, whereas you are rebelling against Him
	even though you are insignificant chieftains in comparison with him.
	Besides this, though Zul-Qarnain built one of the strongest walls
	for protection, yet his real trust was in Allah and not in the
	&quot;wall&quot;. He believed that the wall could protect him
	against his enemies as long as it was the will of Allah and that
	there would be crack and holes in it, when it would be His will :

forward any clear argument in support of their creed? Well, who can

so that they may ask one another (about their wonderful experience).
One of them asked, &ldquo;Well, how long have you remained in this
condition?&rdquo; The others answered, &ldquo;May-be, we have
remained so for a day or a part of a day.&rdquo; Then they declared,
&ldquo;Your Lord knows best how long we have remained in this
condition. So let us send one of us with this silver coin to the
city, and he should look for a place wherein he can get the best food
so that he may bring something to eat. He should, however, conduct
himself with caution lest anyone should discover our whereabouts; for
if they succeed in over-powering us, they will surely stone us to
death or force us back into their Faith, and in that case we will
never be able to obtain true success.&rdquo; In this way We revealed
their secret to the people of the city<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote17anc" HREF="#sdfootnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A>

them&rdquo;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote19anc" HREF="#sdfootnote19sym"><SUP>19</SUP></A>

O Muhammad, present a parable<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote36anc" HREF="#sdfootnote36sym"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
before them. There were two persons; to one of those We gave two
gardens of vine and surrounded them with a fence of date-palm trees
and We kept a piece of land between them for cultivation. Both of the
vine-yards yielded abundant fruit and did not fail anywise in
bringing forth their produce, and We caused a canal to flow in their
midst. And the owner of the gardens got much benefit. In spite of all
this, while conversing with his neighbor, he said, &ldquo;I have more
of wealth than you and have mightier men at my service.&rdquo; Then
he entered his &ldquo;Paradise,&rdquo;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote37anc" HREF="#sdfootnote37sym"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
while he was unjust to himself, and said, &ldquo;I don't think that
this wealth of mine will ever perish, and I do not believe that the
Hour of Resurrection will ever come. Anyhow if ever I am returned to
my Lord, I will get even a grander place than this.&rdquo;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote38anc" HREF="#sdfootnote38sym"><SUP>38</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

out in any way.&quot; At last (it so happened that) all his fruit
produce was destroyed and, seeing his vines overturned on the
trellises, he began to wring his hands at the loss of what he had
spent on it, saying, &quot;I wish I had not associated a partner with
my Lord! &quot;He was so helpless that neither could he find any host
to help him against Allah, nor was himself able to avert that

helping rests with Allah, the True One. That reward is the best Which
He bestows and that end is the-best to which He leads.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

(Now relate to them the event regarding Moses,) when Moses said to
his attendant, &ldquo;I will not bring my journey to an end until I
reach the confluence of the two rivers: otherwise I will continue my
journey for years.&rdquo;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote57anc" HREF="#sdfootnote57sym"><SUP>57</SUP></A>
And it so happened that when they reached the confluence, they became
neglectful of their fish and it burrowed its way to the river as
through a tunnel. When they had passed on further, Moses said to his
attendant, &ldquo;Let us have our breakfast, for we are dead tired
because of to-day's journey.&rdquo; The attendant said, &ldquo;Did
you not notice what a strange thing happened when we were taking rest
by the side of that rock? I totally forgot about the fish and satan
made me so neglectful of it that I could not mention it to you: the
fish slipped into the river in a marvelous manner.&rdquo; Moses
replied, &ldquo;That is exactly what we were seeking.&rdquo;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote58anc" HREF="#sdfootnote58sym"><SUP>58</SUP></A>
Accordingly, they both went back, retracing their footsteps, and

Then they traveled on until they reached a certain habitation and
requested its inhabitants to give them some food but they declined to
entertain them. There they saw a wall which was about to fall down.
That person set it up again. Moses said, &ldquo;Had you wanted, you
could have demanded payment for your labor.&rdquo; The other said,
&quot;That will do: we must now part company. Now I explain those
things about which you could not keep patience. As regards the boat,
it belonged to a few poor persons who toiled on the river. I intended
to damage it because further on there was the territory of a king who
forcibly seized every boat. As for the boy, his parents were true
Believers and we feared lest he should trouble them with his
rebellion and unbelief. Therefore we, wished that in his stead their
Lord may grant them another child who may be more righteous and
filial. As regards the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys, who
reside in this city. A treasure for them lies buried under this wall.
As their father was a righteous man, your Lord willed that when these
children attain their maturity, they should dig out their treasure.
All this has been done as a mercy from your Lord: I have not done
anything of my own authority. This is the interpretation of those
things about which you could not keep patience.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote60anc" HREF="#sdfootnote60sym"><SUP>60</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	time of the revelation of this Surah . It clearly shows that the
	Holy Prophet did not grieve at the persecution from which he and his
	Companions were suffering but at the deviation and moral
	degeneration of his people. What was consuming him was that, though
	he was trying to bring them out from their disgraceful state, they
	persisted in it. He was grieved because he was convinced that their
	deviation would inevitably lead them to destruction and scourge of
	Allah. Therefore he was working day and night to save them but it
	appeared that they were bent upon incurring the chastisement of
	Allah. The Holy Prophet himself has described this state of his mind
	in a Tradition to this effect: &quot;I may describe this thing in a
	parable. A person kindled a fire to spread light but the moths
	persist in falling over it to burn themselves alive. He vies to save
	them from the fire but the moths reduce his efforts to failure. The

	&quot;As you are not responsible for forcing them to believe, why
	should you consume yourself for their sake? Your only duty is to
	give good news and warning and not to turn people into Believers.
	Therefore you may go on carrying out your mission of giving good

<DIV ID="sdfootnote9">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote9sym" HREF="#sdfootnote9anc">9</A>The
	oldest evidence of this story is found in a homily written in Syriac
	by Jacob of Sarug, a Christian priest of Syria, who was born in A.D.
	452, a few years after the death of &quot;the Companions of the
	Cave.&quot; The homily which describes the legend in great detail
	was composed by him in or about A.D. 474. On the one hand, this same
	Syriac version came into the hands of our early commentators, and
	Ibn Jarir Tabari cited it in his commentary with various
	authorities, and on the other, it reached Europe where its
	translations and abridged versions were published in Greek and
	Latin. The abridged story as told by Gibbon in Chapter 33 of his The
	Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire under the heading, &quot;The
	Seven Sleepers&quot;, so closely resembles the story told by our
	commentators that both the versions seem to have been drawn from the
	same source. For instance, the name of the king, whose persecutions
	made the Seven Christian youths of Ephesus take refuge in the cave,
	was Emperor Decius according to Gibbon. He ruled the Roman Empire
	from A.D. 249 to 251 and whose reign is very notorious because of
	his persecution of the followers of Prophet Jesus Christ, while our
	commentators call him `Decanus', `Decaus', etc. The city, where this
	event happened, was `Aphesus', or `Aphesos' according to our
	commentators, while according to Gibbon it was Ephesus, which was
	the biggest Roman city and sea-port on the west coast of Asia Minor.
	The ruins of this city can still be seen 20 to 25 miles south of the
	modern Turkish city of Izmir. (Please see Map No. 1 for reference).
	Again the name of the king, during whose reign &quot;the Companions
	of the Cave&quot; awoke was `Tezusius' according to the Muslim
	commentators and Theodosius II according to Gibbon. He ruled over
	Rome from A.D. 408 to 450, after the Roman Empire had accepted
	Christianity.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	resemblance between the two versions is so close that even the name
	of the companion whom the Sleepers sent to the city to buy food
	after waking up has been mentioned as `Jamblicha' by the Muslim
	scholars and Jamblichus by Gibbon. The details of the story in both
	the versions are also similar which are briefly as follows:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When
	during the reign of the Emperor Decius the followers of Prophet
	Jesus Christ were being mercilessly persecuted, the Seven Christian
	youths hid themselves in a cave and fell into a sleep. Then in the
	38th year of the reign of the Emperor Theodosius II (approximately
	in A.D. 445 or 446) they awoke when the whole of the Roman Empire
	had become Christian. Thus, they slept in the cave for nearly 196
	years.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On this
	ground some orientalists have rejected that the above-mentioned
	story is the same as that given in the Qur'an because the period of
	their stay in the cave according to the Qur'an (v. 25) was 309
	years. We have, however, answered this objection in E.N. 25.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are
	a few minor differences between the Quranic and Syriac versions, on
	the basis of which Gibbon has charged the Holy Prophet with
	&quot;ignorance&quot;. However, the Syriac version, on the basis of
	whose authenticity he has committed this gross insolence, was even
	according to him written thirty to forty years after the event by a
	Syrian. He has not taken the trouble to consider the fact that
	verbal versions of events do change a bit during such a long time
	while they are communicated from one country to the other. Therefore
	it is wrong to take such a version of the story for granted and
	literally true and to charge the Qur'an with discrepancy for any
	main difference with it. Such an attitude is worthy only .of those
	people who are so blinded by religious prejudices that they discard
	even the most ordinary demands of reason.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The city
	of Ephesus where the event of the Sleepers of the Cave took place,
	was built about 11th century B.C. and became a great center of idol
	worship, its chief deity being the moon goddess, Diana, whose temple
	was regarded as a wonder of the ancient world. Most of her devotees
	belonged to Asia Minor and the Roman Empire also had accepted her as
	one of its deities.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After
	Prophet Jesus when his message started reaching different parts of
	the Roman Empire, a few youths of Ephesus also gave up idol worship
	and accepted God as their only Lord. Gregory of Tours has collected
	details about these Christian youths in his Meraculorum Liber, which
	are briefly as follows:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;They
	were seven youths. When the Emperor Decius heard of their change of
	faith, he summoned them and questioned them about their new
	religion. ht spite of knowing that the Emperor was deadly against
	the followers of Christ, they frankly admitted before him that their
	Lord is the Lord of the earth and heavens, and that they recognized
	none else as Deity for if they did so, they would be committing a
	grave sin. The Emperor became furious to hear this, and warned that
	he would have them killed, but then considering their tender age, he
	granted them three days in which they were counseled to revert to
	their old faith, otherwise they would be put to death.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	seven youths took advantage of the situation and fled the city to
	conceal themselves in a cave in the mountains. On the way a dog also
	followed them: they did their best to scare it away, but it would
	not leave them. At last they found a spacious cave as a suitable
	refuge and hid in it, and the dog sat at the entrance. Being tired
	they soon fell into a deep slumber. This happened in about 250 A.D.
	After about 197 years, in 447 A.D., during the reign of Emperor
	Theodosius II, they awoke suddenly when the whole Roman Empire had
	embraced Christianity and the Ephesians had given up idolatry.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;At
	this time a fierce controversy was going on among the Romans
	regarding the reality of the life-after-death and Resurrection, and
	the Emperor himself was anxious to eradicate somehow the disbelief
	in the life-after-death from the minds of his people. So much so
	that one day he prayed that God in His mercy may show a sign which
	tray help restore and correct the people's belief. In precisely the
	same days the Seven Sleepers awoke in the cave.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;After
	waking up the youths started asking one another about how long they
	might have slept. Some said it might have been a day: others said it
	was a part of a day. When they reached no conclusion, they stopped
	arguing, leaving the knowledge of the exact period to God.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then they
	sent Jean, a companion, to the city with a few silver coins to buy
	food, and warned him to be on his guard lest the people should
	recognize him, for they feared that if they were discovered the
	Ephesians would force them to bow before Diana. But when Jean came
	to the city he was astonished to see that the world had changed: the
	whole population had embraced Christianity, and there was nobody in
	the city to worship Diana. He came to a shop and wanted to buy a few
	loaves of bread. When he paid in a coin bearing the image of Emperor
	Decius, the shopkeeper could not believe his eyes and asked the
	stranger from where he had obtained that coin. When the young man
	said that it was his own, a dispute began between them and soon a
	crowd gathered around them, and the matter reached the chief officer
	of the city. The officer himself was puzzled and wanted to know the
	whereabouts of the treasure-house from where the young man had taken
	the coin, but the latter insisted that it belonged to him. The
	officer did not believe him because he thought that a young man like
	him could not possibly possess a centuries-old coin which had not
	even been seen by the elders in the city. When Jean came to know
	that the Emperor Decius had died., he was pleasantly surprised. He
	told the crowd that he and his six companions had fled the city only
	the other day and taken refuge in a cave to escape Decius'
	persecution. The officer was greatly surprised and followed the
	young man to see the cave where his companions lay in hiding. And a
	great crowd followed behind them. When they came to the cave, it was
	fully established that the youths really belonged to the Emperor
	Decius' period. Consequently, Emperor Theodosius was informed and he
	also visited the cave to receive grace. Then the seven youths went
	back into the cave and lay down and breathed their last. Seeing this
	clear sign the people's belief in the life-after-death was restored,
	and a monument was ordered to be built over the cave by the
	Emperor.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The story
	of the Sleepers of the Cave as narrated above, corresponds so
	closely with that mentioned in the Qur'an that the seven youths can
	easily be regarded as &quot;Ashab-i-Kahf&quot; (the Companions of
	the Cave). Some people, however, have raised the objection that this
	story concerns a city of Asia Minor, and the Qur'an does not discuss
	or refer to any event that might have taken place outside Arabia;
	therefore it would be against the Quranic style and spirit to label
	this Christian story as the story of Ashab-i-Kahf'. In our opinion
	this objection is not correct. The Qur'an means to impress and warn
	the Arabs by relating stories concerning the various ancient tribes
	who had transgressed from the right path and with whom they were
	familiar, whether they lived and flourished inside Arabia or outside
	it. It is for this very reason that a mention has been made of the
	ancient history of Egypt in the Qur'an, whereas Egypt has never been
	a part of Arabia. The question is that when the history of Egypt can
	be mentioned in the Qur'an, why cannot Rome and the Roman history
	with which the Arabs were as familiar as with the Egyptian history?
	The Roman frontiers adjoined the northern Hijaz and the Arab
	caravans traded with the Romans almost throughout the year. Then
	there were a number of Arab tribes who were directly under Roman
	domination and the Roman Empire was in no way unknown to the Arabs,
	a fact which is fully borne nut by Surah Ar-Rum. Another thing which
	should be borne in mind is that the story of the Sleepers of the
	Cave has been related in the Qur'an in response to a query raised by
	the disbelievers of Makkah, who had been prompted by the Jews and
	Christians to question the Holy Prophet on such matters as were
	wholly unknown to the Arabs in order to test his Prophethood.</P>

	discussions were going on in Ephesus about Resurrection and the
	Hereafter. Though the people had embraced Christianity under the

	the Romans and the effects of the Greek philosophy were still very
	powerful. So in spite of the Christian creed of the Hereafter, many
	people denied this, or at least were skeptical about this. To add to
	this the Sadducee sect of the Jews, who formed a great part of the
	population of the city, openly denied the Hereafter and professed to
	base this on the Torah. The Christian scholars, however, could not
	put forward any strong arguments to refute them: so much so that the
	reports of the polemical discussion given in Matthew, Mark and Luke,
	attributed to Prophet Christ, are admittedly very weak even
	according to the Christian scholars. (Please refer to Matthew 22:
	23-33, Mark 12: 18-27, Luke 20: 27-40). That is why the disbelievers

	of the fifth century, the common people, especially the orthodox
	among the Christians, had become fully involved in shirk and the
	worship of saints and tombs. They used to visit the tombs of the
	saints to worship them and kept the statues of Jesus, Mary and the

	was because that was not the age of the press in which authentic

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote23sym" HREF="#sdfootnote23anc">23</A>This
	is meant to impress that the real thing in this story is not the
	number of the Sleepers but the lessons it teaches: (1) A true
	believer should not on any account turn away from the truth and bow
	before falsehood. (2) A believer should not merely rely on the
	material means but on Allah. He should trust in God and follow the
	right way, even though the outward adverse circumstances might
	appear to be unfavorable. (3) It is wrong to suppose that Allah is
	bound by any so-called &quot;Law of Nature&quot;, for He is able to
	do any thing He wills even though that might seem to be against some
	common experience. He has the power to change any so-called law of
	nature, whenever and wherever He wills and bring about any
	extraordinary &quot;supernatural&quot; thing. So much so that He can
	raise up anyone who might have been asleep for two hundred years, as
	if he had slept only for a few hours, without letting any change
	take place in his appearance, dress, health, indeed in anything,
	during the passage of time. (4) This teaches us that Allah has the
	power to bring to life all the generations-past, present and future
	all together as asserted by the Prophets and Divine Scriptures. (5)
	It teaches us that ignorant people have always been perverting the
	Signs of Allah which are sent for the right guidance of the people.
	That is how the miracle of the Sleepers of the Cave, which had been
	shown as a proof of the Hereafter, had been turned into a means of
	shirk, as if they were some saints who had been sent only for this
	purpose.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is
	obvious from the above-mentioned real lessons, which one can learn
	from the story of the Sleepers, that a wise man will pay his
	attention to these things and not divert it in search of their
	number, their names, the color of their dog and the like. Only those
	people, who have no interest for the reality but for superficial
	things, will spend their time and energy in making investigations
	about such things. That is why Allah instructed the Holy Prophet:
	&quot;You should not enter into useless and irrelevant discussions
	about such things, if other people try to involve you in them.
	Instead of wasting your time in such useless things, you should
	concentrate your attention only on your mission.&quot; That is why
	Allah has not Himself told their exact number lest it should
	encourage such people as are always hankering after useless things.

	the Truth from your Lord: now whosoever wills, he may accept it and
	whosoever wills, he may reject it. But people must understand that
	no compromise will be made in regard to the Truth just as the
	Sleepers of the Cave did not make any compromise with regard to
	their creed. They did not make any compromise in regard to the
	Doctrine of Tauhid after they had believed in it and categorically
	declared, &quot;Our Lord is the One Who alone is the Lord of the
	heavens and the earth.&quot; After this declaration they did not in
	any way accede to the making of any compromise with their people,
	who had gone astray, but firmly declared, &quot;We will not give Him
	up and pray to other deities, because it will be the most improper
	thing, if we do so.&quot; After making this declaration they left
	their people and deities and took refuge in the Cave without taking
	any provisions with them. After' this when they rose up, the only
	thing about which they showed any anxiety, was that their people
	might not succeed in forcing them back to their own faith. After
	relating these things, the Qur'an addresses the Holy Prophet to the
	effect (though these words are really meant for the opponents of
	Islam): &quot;It is absolutely out of question whether any
	compromise can be made with mushriks and disbelievers. present the
	truth intact to them whether they accept it or not. If they do not
	accept it, they themselves will meet with an evil end. As regards
	those, who have accepted the Truth (whether they be youngsters or
	poor, indigent people or slaves or laborers,) they are really those
	people who have a worth with Allah, and they alone will be honored.

	rich people who may be neglectful of Allah and be slaves of their
	lust, even though they might be possessors of worldly grandeur.&quot;</P>

	this story was told in answer to the question of the disbelievers,
	it has been used to impress a very important truth on the minds of
	both the disbelievers and the believers. It is this: those people
	who draw their conclusions only from the seeming aspects of events,
	make a very serious error in their deductions, for they only see
	what is apparent and do not go deep into the Divine Wisdom that
	underlies them. When they daily see the prosperity of the tyrants
	and the afflictions of the innocent people, the affluence of the
	disobedient people and the indigence of the obedient people, the
	enjoyments of the wicked people and the adversity of the virtuous
	people, they get involved in mental conflicts, nay, they become
	victims of misunderstandings because they do not comprehend the
	wisdom behind them. The disbelievers and the tyrants conclude from
	this that the world is functioning without any moral laws and has no
	sovereign, and, if there is one, he must be senseless and unjust:
	therefore one may do whatever one desires for there is none to whom
	one shall be accountable. On the other hand, when the believers see
	those things, they become so frustrated and disheartened that
	sometimes their faiths are put to x very hard trial. It was to
	unravel the wisdom behind this mystery that Allah slightly lifted
	the curtain from the Reality governing His factory, so that Moses
	might see the wisdom behind the events that are happening day and
	night and how their seeming aspect is quite different from the
	Reality.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the question: when and where did this event take place?
	The Qur'an says nothing about this. There is a tradition related by
	Aufi in which he cites a saying of Ibn 'Abbas to this effect: &quot;This
	event happened after the destruction of Pharaoh when Prophet Moses
	had settled his people in Egypt&quot;. But this is not supported by
	other more authentic traditions from Ibn 'Abbas which Dave been
	cited in the collection of Bukhari and other books of Traditions,
	nor is there any other source which may prove that Prophet Moses
	ever settled in Egypt after the destruction of Pharaoh. On the
	contrary, the Qur'an says explicitly that Prophet Moses passed the
	whole of his life after Exodus from Egypt in the desert (Sinai and
	At-Tilt). Therefore the tradition from 'Aufi cannot be accepted.
	However, if we consider the details of this story, two things are
	quite obvious: (1) These things would have been demonstrated to
	Prophet Moses in the earlier period of his Prophethood because such
	things are needed in the beginning of Prophethood for the teaching
	and training of the Prophets. (2) As this story has been cited to
	comfort the Believers of Makkah, it can be reasonably concluded that
	these demonstrations would have been shown to Prophet Moses, when
	the Israelites were encountering the same conditions as the Muslims
	of Makkah did at the time of the revelation of this Surah. On the
	basis of these two things, we are of the opinion (and correct
	Knowledge is with Allah alone) that this event relates to the
	period, when the persecution of the Israelites by Pharaoh was at its
	height and, like the chiefs of the Quraish, Pharaoh and his
	courtiers were deluded by delay in the scourge that there was no
	power above them to take them to task, and like the persecuted
	Muslims of Makkah, the persecuted Muslims of Egypt were crying in
	their agony, as if to say, &quot;Our Lord! how long will the
	prosperity of these tyrants and our adversity continue ?&quot; So
	much so that Prophet Moses himself cried out: &quot;.... Our Lord,
	Thou hast bestowed on Pharaoh and his nobles splendor and
	possessions in the worldly life; O our Lord, hast Thou done this
	drat they might lead astray the people from Thy Way?...&quot; (X:
	88)</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If our
	conjecture is correct, then it may be concluded that probably this
	event took place during Prophet Moses' journey to Sudan, and by the
	confluence of the rivers is meant the site of the present city of
	Khartum where the Blue Nile and the White Nile meet together.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The Bible
	does not say anything about this event but the Talmud does relate
	this though it assigns it to Rabbi Jochanan, the son of Levi,
	instead of to Prophet Moses, and according to it the other person
	was Elijah who had been taken up alive to heaven and joined with the
	angels for the purpose of the administration of the world. (The
	Talmud Selections by H. Polano, pp. 313-16).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is
	just possible that like the events, which happened before the
	Exodus. this event also might not have remained intact but during
	the passage of centuries changes and alterations might have been
	made in it. But it is a pity that some Muslims have been so
	influenced by the Talmud that they opine that in this story Moses
	does not refer to Prophet Moses but to some other person bearing the
	same name. They forget that every tradition of the Talmud is not
	necessarily correct, nor have we any reason to suppose that the
	Qur'an has related the story concerning some unknown person bearing
	the name &quot;Moses&quot;. Above all, when we learn from an
	authentic Tradition related by Ubayy-bin-Ka`ab that the Holy Prophet
	himself made it clear that in this story, by Moses is meant Prophet
	Moses, there is absolutely no reason why any Muslim should consider
	any statement of the Talmud at all.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Orientalists have, as usual, tried to make a &quot;research&quot;
	into the &quot;sources&quot; of this story and have pointed out that
	&quot;The Kuranic story may be traced back to three main
	sources:'(1) The Gilgamesh Epic, (2) The Alexander Romance and (3)
	The Jewish Legend of Elijah and Rabbi Joshua hen Levi (Encyclopaedia
	of Islam new edition and Shorter Erlcyclopaedia of !slam under the
	heading Al Khadir). This is because these malicious &quot;scholars&quot;
	decide beforehand that their &quot;scientific research&quot; must
	lead to the conclusion that the Qur'an is not a revealed book:
	therefore they have, anyhow or other, to produce a proof that
	whatever Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) has presented as
	Revelation, has been plagiarized from such and such &quot;sources&quot;.
	In this these people brazen facedly use &quot;facts&quot; and
	&quot;quotations&quot; so cunningly and cleverly as to achieve their
	mean end and one begins to have nausea at their &quot;research&quot;.
	If that is research what these bigoted forgers make, then one is
	compelled to curse their &quot;knowledge and research.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">We ask
	them to answer our questions in order to expose their &quot;research&quot;:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(I) What
	proof have you got to make the claim that the Qur'an has based a
	certain statement on the contents of a couple of ancient books?
	Obviously it will not be &quot;research&quot; to build this claim on
	the scant basis that a certain statement trade in the Quran is
	similar to the one found in these books.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) Do
	you possess any knowledge that at the time of the revelation of the
	Qur'an there was a library at Makkah from which the Holy Prophet
	collected material for the Qur'an? This question is pertinent
	because if a list were to be trade of the numerous books in
	different languages, which you allege were sources of the stories
	and statements contained in the Qur'an, it will become long enough
	for a big library. Have you got any proof that Muhammad (Allah's
	peace be upon him) had arranged for such translators as translated
	into Arabic those books from different languages for his use? If it
	is not so and your allegation is based on a couple of journeys which
	the Holy Prophet made outside Arabia, a question arises: How many
	books did the Holy Prophet copy or commit to memory during these
	trade journeys before his Prophethood? And how is it that even a day
	before he claimed to be a Prophet, no sign at all was displayed in.
	his conversation that he had gathered such information as was
	revealed in the Qur'an afterwards?</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) How
	is it then that the contemporary disbelievers of Makkah and the Jews
	and the Christians, who like you, were always in search of such a
	proof, could not put forward even a single instance of plagiarism?
	They had a goad reason to produce an instance of this because they
	were being challenged over and over again to refute the claim that
	the Qur'an was a revealed book and it had no other source than
	Divine Knowledge and that if they said that it was a human work,
	they were to prove this by bringing the like of it. Though this
	challenge had broken the back of the contemporary opponents of
	Islam, they could not point out even a single plausible source that
	might prove reasonably that the Qur'an was based on it. In the light
	of these facts one may ask, &quot;Why had the contemporaries of the
	Holy Prophet failed in their research and how have the opponents of
	Islam succeeded in their attempt today after the passage of more
	than a thousand years?&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	last and the most important question is: Does it not show that it is
	bigotry and malice that has misled the opponents of Islam to discard
	the possibility that the Qur'an may be a revealed book of Allah and
	to concentrate all their efforts to prove that it is not so at all ?
	The tact that its stories are similar to those contained in the
	former books, could be considered equally in this light that the
	Qur'an was a revealed book and was relating them in order to correct
	those errors that had crept into them during the passage of time.
	Why should their research be confined to prove that those books are
	the real source of the stories of the Qur'an and not to consider the
	other possibility that the Qur'an itself was a revealed book?</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">An
	impartial person who will consider these questions will inevitably
	arrive at the conclusion that the &quot;research&quot; which the
	orientalists have presented in the name of &quot;knowledge&quot; is
	not worth any serious consideration.</P>

	people have asserted under the influence of the Israelite
	traditions. Their assertion is incorrect not only because it
	contradicts the assertion of the Holy Prophet but it is also absurd
	because Prophet Elijah was born several hundred years after Prophet
	Moses. Though the Qur'an does not mention the name of the attendant
	of Prophet Moses, according to some traditions he was Joshua, the
	son of Nun, who succeeded him.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote60">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote60sym" HREF="#sdfootnote60anc">60</A>In
	connection with this story, a very hard problem arises to which an
	answer must be found: Two of the three things done by Hadrat Khidr
	are obviously against those commandments of the Law which have
	always been in force since the creation of man. No law allows anyone
	the right to damage the property of another and kill an innocent
	person. So much so that if a man were to know by inspiration that
	some usurper would illegally seize a certain boat, and that a
	certain boy would be involved in a rebellion and unbelief, even then
	no law, sent down by Allah, makes it lawful that one should bore a
	hole in the boat and kill the innocent boy by virtue of one's
	inspiration. If in answer to this, one were to say that Hadrat Khidr
	committed these two acts by the Commands of Allah, this does not
	solve the problem, for the question is not this, &quot;By whose
	command did Hadrat Khidr commit these acts&quot;? but it is this:
	&quot;What was the nature of these commands&quot;? This is important
	because Hadrat Khidr did these acts in accordance with Divine
	Command, for he himself says that these acts of his were not done by
	his own authority, but were moved by the mercy of Allah, and Allah
	Himself has testified this by saying: &quot;We gave him a special
	knowledge from Ourselves&quot;. Thus it is beyond any doubt that
	these acts were done by the Command of Allah, but the question about
	the nature of the command remains there, for it is obvious that
	these commands were not legal because it is not allowed by any
	Divine Law, and the fundamental principles of the Qur'an also do not
	allow that a person should kill another person without any proof of
	his guilt. Therefore we shall have to admit that these commands
	belonged to one of those decrees of Allah in accordance with which
	one sick person recovers, while another dies: one becomes prosperous
	and the other is ruined. If the Commands given to Hadrat Khidr were
	of this nature, then one must come to the conclusion that Hadrat
	Khidr was an angel (or some other kind of Allah's creation) who is
	not bound by the Divine Law prescribed for human beings, for such
	commands as have no legal aspect, can be addressed to angels only.
	This is because the question of the lawful or the unlawful cannot
	arise about them: they obey the Commands of Allah without having any
	personal power. In contrast to them, a man shall be guilty of a sin
	whether he does any such thing inadvertently by intuition or by some
	inspiration, if his act goes against some Divine Commandment. This
	is because a man is bound to abide by Divine Commandments as a man,
	and there is no room whatsoever in the Divine Law that an act may
	become lawful for a man merely because he had received an
	instruction by inspiration and had been informed in a secret way of
	the wisdom of that unlawful act.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	above-mentioned principle has been unanimously accepted by scholars
	of the Divine Law and the leaders of Sufism. `Allamah Alusi has
	cited in detail the sayings of 'Abdul Wahhab Shi`irani, Muhy-ud-Din
	ibn-`Arabi, Mujaddid Alf Thani, Shaikh 'Abdul-Qadir Jilani, Junaid
	Baghdadi, Sirri Saqti, Abul-Hussain An-nuri, Abu Said-al-Kharraz,
	Ahmad ud-Dainauri and Imam Ghazzali to this effect that it is not
	lawful even for a sufi to act in accordance with that inspiration of
	his own which goes against a fundamental of law. (Ruh-ul-Ma ani,
	Vol. XVI, pp. 16-18). That is why we have come to the conclusion
	that Hadrat Khidr must be an angel, or some other kind of Allah's
	creation, exempted from human law, for he could not be the only
	exception to the above-mentioned formula. Therefore we inevitably
	come to the conclusion that he was one of those Servants of Allah
	who act in accordance with the will of Allah and not in accordance
	with the Divine Law prescribed for human beings.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">We would
	have accepted the theory that Hadrat Khidr was a human being, if the
	Qur'an had plainly asserted that the &quot;servant&quot; to whom
	Prophet Moses was sent for training, was a man, but the Qur'an does
	not specifically say that he was a human being but says that he was
	&ldquo;one of Our Servants&rdquo; which does not show that he was
	necessarily a human being. Besides this, there is no Tradition which
	specifically says that Hadrat Khidr was a human being. In the
	authentic traditions related by Said bin Jubair, Ibn `Abbas, Ubayy
	bin Ka`ab from the Holy Prophet, the Arabic word, ,}i~ (rajul) has
	been used for Hadrat Khidr, which though generally used for human
	beings, is not exclusively used for human beings. In the Holy Qur'an
	itself, this word has been used for Jinns also (LXXIII 6). It is
	also obvious that when a jinn or an angel or an invisible being will
	come before a human being, he will surely come in human shape and,
	in that form; he will be called a bashar (man), just like the angel
	who came before Mary in the shape of a human being (XIX: 17). Thus
	the word rajul, used for Hadrat Khidr in the above mentioned
	Tradition by the Holy Prophet, does not necessarily mean that he was
	a human being. Therefore we are quite justified in the light of the
	above discussion to believe that Hadrat Khidr was one of the angels
	or some other kind of Allah's creation who is not bound by the
	Divine Law prescribed for human beings. Some of the former scholars
	of the Qur'an have also expressed the same opinion which . has been
	cited by lbn Kathir in his Commentary on the authority of Mawardi.

<DIV ID="sdfootnote62">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote62sym" HREF="#sdfootnote62anc">62</A>The
	identification of Zul-Qarnain has been a controversial matter from
	the earliest times. in general the commentators have been of the
	opinion that he was Alexander the Great but the characteristics of
	Zul-Qarnain described in the Qur'an are not applicable to him.
	However, now the commentators are inclined to believe that
	Zul-Qarnain was Cyrus, an ancient king of Iran. We are also of the
	opinion that probably Zul-Qarnain was Cyrus, but the historical
	facts, which have come to light up to this time, are not sufficient
	to make any categorical assertion.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the characteristics of Zul-Qarnain in the light of his
	story as given in the Quran:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	title Zul-Qarnain (&quot;The Two-Horned&quot;) should have been
	quite familiar to the Jews, for it was at their instigation that the
	disbelievers of Makkah put this question to the Holy Prophet.
	Therefore we must turn to the Jewish literature in order to learn
	who was the person known as &quot;The Two-Horned&quot; or which was
	the kingdom known as &quot;The Two-Horned.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Zul-Qarnain must have been a great ruler and a great conqueror whose
	conquests might have spread from the East to the West and on the
	third side to the North or to the South. Before the revelation of
	the Qur'an there had been several persons, who were such great
	conquerors. So we must confine our research for the other
	characteristics of Zul-Qarnain to one of these persons.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) This
	title should be applicable to such a ruler who might have
	constructed a strong wall across a mountain pass to protect his
	kingdom from the incursions of Gog and Magog. In order to
	investigate this thing, we will have to determine as to who were Gog
	and Magog. We will also have to find out when such a wall was built
	and by whom and to which territory it was adjacent.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4)
	Besides possessing the above-mentioned characteristics, he should
	also be a God-worshiper and a just ruler, for the Qur'an has brought
	into prominence these characteristics more than anything else.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The first
	of these characteristics is easily applicable to Cyrus, for
	according to the Bible Prophet Daniel saw in his vision that the
	united kingdom of Media and Persia was like a two-horned ram before
	the rise of the Greeks. (Dan. 8: 3,&quot;20). The Jews had a very
	high opinion of &quot;The Two-horned&quot; one, because it was his
	invasion which brought about the downfall of the kingdom of Babylon
	and the liberation of the Israelites (Please also refer to E.N. 8 of
	Chapter XVII).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second characteristic is applicable to him to a great extent but not
	completely. Though his conquests spread to Syria and Asia Minor in
	the West and to Bakhtar (Balkh) in the East, there is no trace of
	any of his great expeditions to the North or to the South, whereas
	the Qur'an makes an explicit mention of his third expedition.
	Nevertheless, this third expedition is not wholly out of question
	for history tells us that his kingdom extended to Caucasia in the
	North. As regards Gog and Magog, it has been nearly established that
	they were the wild tribes of Central Asia who were known by
	different names: Tartars, Mongols, Huns and Scythians, who 'had been
	making inroads on settled kingdoms and empires from very ancient
	times. It is also known that strong bulwarks had been built in
	southern regions of Caucasia, though it has not been as yet
	historically established that these were built by Cyrus.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the last characteristic, Cyrus is the only known conqueror
	among the ancient rulers, to whom this may be applicable, for even
	his enemies have been full of praise for him for his justice, and,
	Ezra, a book of the Bible, asserts that he was a God-worshiper and a
	God-fearing king who set free the Israelites because of his
	God-worship, and ordered that the Temple of Solomon should be
	rebuilt for the worship of Allah, Who has no partner.</P>

	light of the above, we admit that of all the conquerors, who had
	passed away before the revelation of the Qur'an, Cyrus alone is the
	one to whom the characteristics of &quot;Zul-Qarnain&quot; are most
	applicable, but we need more evidence to determine specifically that
	Cyrus is definitely &quot;Zul-Qarnain.&quot; Anyhow, there is no
	other conqueror to whom the characteristics stated in the Qur'an are
	as much applicable as to Cyrus.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Historically
	it is enough to say that Cyrus was a Persian ruler, whose rise began
	about 549 B.C. In a few years, he conquered the kingdom of Media and
	Lydia and afterwards conquered Babylon in 539 B.C. After this no
	powerful kingdom was left to oppose him. His conquests extended to
	Sind and the territory known as Turkistan on one side, and to Egypt
	and Libya and to Thrace and Macedonia and to Caucasia and Khawarzam
	in the North. In fact, the whole civilized world was under his sway.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As

	mean the time of the death and destruction of everything destined by
	Allah at the end of the world i.e., the Hour of Resurrection.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people have entertained the misunderstanding that the wall
	attributed here to Zul-Qarnain refers to the famous Wall of China,
	whereas this wall was built between Derbent and Dar'yal, two cities
	of Daghestan in the Caucasus, the land that lies between the Black
	Sea and the Caspian. There are high mountains between the Black Sea
	and Dar'yal having deep gorges which cannot allow large armies to
	pass through them. Between Derbent and Dar'yal, however, there are
	no such mountains and the passes also are wide and passable. In
	ancient times savage hordes from the north invaded and ravaged
	southern lands through these passes and the Persian rulers who were
	scared of them had to build a strong wall, 50 miles long, 29 feet
	high and 10 feet wide, for fortification purposes, ruins of which
	can still be seen. Though it has not yet been established
	historically who built this wall in the beginning, the Muslim
	historians and geographers assign it to ZulQarnain because its
	remains correspond with the description of it given in the Qur'an.
	Ibn Jarir Tabari and Ibn Kathir have recorded the event, and Yaqut
	has mentioned it in his Mu jam-ul-Buldan that when after the
	conquest of Azerbaijan, Hadrat `Umar sent Suraqah bin `Amr, in 22
	A.H. on an expedition to Derbent, the latter appointed `Abdur Rehman
	bin Rabi`ah as the chief of his vanguard. When 'Abdur Rehman entered
	Armenia, the ruler Shehrbraz surrendered without fighting. Then when
	`Abdur Rehman wanted to advance towards Derbent, Shehrbraz informed
	him that he had already gathered full information about the wall
	built by Zul-Qarnain, through a man, who could supply all the
	necessary details and then the man was actually presented before
	`Abdur Rehman. (Tabari, Vol. III, pp. 235-239; AI-Bidayah
	wan-Nihayah, Vol. VII, pp. 122-125, and Mu jam-ul-Buldan, under
	Bab-ul-Abwab: Derbent).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Two
	hundred years later, the Abbasid Caliph Wathiq (227-233 A.H.)
	despatched a party of 50 men under Sallam-ul-Tarjuman to study the
	wall of Zul Qarnain, whose observations have been recorded in great
	detail by Yaqut in Mu jam-ul-Buldan and by Ibn Kathir in AI-Bidayah.
	They write that this expedition reached Samarrah from where they
	reached Tiflis (the present Tbilisi) and then through As-Sarir and
	Al-Lan, they reached Filanshah, from where they entered the Caspian
	territory. From there they arrived at Derbent and saw the wall.
	(AIBidayah Vol. II, p. 111, Vol. VII, pp. 122-125; Mu jam-ul-Buldan:
	under Bab-ulAbwab). This clearly shows that even up till the third
	century of Hijrah the Muslim scholars regarded this wall of the
	Caucasus as the wall of Zul-Qarnain.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Yaqut in
	his Mu jam-ul-Buldan has further confirmed the same view at a number
	of places. For instance, under Khazar (Caspian) he writes:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;This
	territory belongs to the Turks, which adjoins the Wall of Zul
	Qarnain just behind Bab-ul-Abwab, which is also called Derbent.&quot;
	In the same connection, he records a report by Ahmad bin Fadlan, the
	ambassador of Caliph Al-Muqtadar-billah, who has given a full
	description of the Caspian land, saying that Caspian is the name of
	a country whose capital is Itil (near the present Astrakhan) right
	through which flows River Itil, which joins the Caspian front Russia
	and Bulghar.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Regarding
	Bab-ul-Abwab he says that this city is called both Al-Bab and
	Derbent, which is a highly difficult passage for the people coming
	from the northern lands towards the south. Once this territory was a
	part of the kingdom of Nausherwan, and the Persian rulers paid
	particular attention to strengthening their frontiers on that side.</P>

	and &quot;Moses and Khidr&quot;, the Qur'an has utilized this story,

	about whose glory you have heard from the people of the Book, was
	not merely a conqueror, but also a believer of the doctrines of

	(1-8): The Holy Prophet invited his people (1) to give up shirk and
	adopt the doctrine of Tauhid instead, (2) to give up the worship of
	the world and to believe in the life of the Hereafter. But the

	avail to them in the life-after-death, even though they might have
	considered them as their great achievements but the fact is that
	they will lose all their value as soon as the world shall come to an
