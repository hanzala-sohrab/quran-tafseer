<H2><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Name</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">The Surah takes its name from the
word </FONT><EM><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">dhil Ma'arij</FONT></EM>
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">in verse 3. </FONT>
</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Period of Revelation</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The subject matter
bears evidence that this Surah too was sent down in conditions
closely resembling those under which Surah Al Haaqqah was sent down. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Theme and Subject
Matter</FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It admonishes and
gives warning to the disbelievers who made fun of the news about
Resurrection and the Hereafter, and Hell and Heaven, and challenged
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) to cause Resurrection with
which he threatened them to take place if what he said was true and
they had become worthy of the punishment in Hell by denying it. The
whole Surah is meant to answer this denial. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The Surah opens with
words to the effect:&quot;A demander has demanded a torment, the
torment which must befall the deniers; and when it takes place, there
will be none to prevent it, but it will take place at its own
appointed time. Allah has His own way of doing things, but He is not
unjust. Therefore, have patience, O Prophet, at what they say. They
think it is far off, but We see it as near at hand.&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then it is
said:&quot;Resurrection, which they desire to be hastened out of jest
and fun, is terrible, and when it comes, it will cause great distress
to the culprits. At that time they will even be prepared to give away
their wives and children and their nearest kinsfolk in ransom to
escape the punishment, but they will not be able to escape it. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then the people have
been warned to the effect; &quot;On that Day the destinies of men
will be decided strictly on the basis of their belief and their
conduct. Those who turn away from the Truth in the world and amass
wealth and withhold it from the needy, will be doomed to Hell; and
those who fear the punishment of God here, believe in the Hereafter,
keep up the Prayer, discharge the rights of the needy out of their
wealth, strictly avoid immoral and wicked deeds, practice honesty in
all their dealings, fulfill their pledges and trust and bear true
witness, will have a place of honor in Paradise&quot; </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In conclusion, the
disbelievers of Makkah who rushed in upon the Holy Prophet (upon whom
be peace) from every side as soon as they saw him, in order to make
fun of him, have been warned to the effect: &quot;If you do not
believe, Allah will replace you by other people who will be better
than you&quot;, and the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been
consoled, so as to say: &quot;Do not take to heart their mockery and
jesting; leave them to indulge in their idle talk and foolish conduct
if they are bent upon experiencing the disgrace and humiliation of
the Resurrection; they will themselves see their evil end.&quot;' </FONT></FONT>

	commentators have taken the verb sa'ala in the Text in the meaning
	of asking, and have interpreted the verse to mean: &quot;The asker
	has asked: whom will the torment with which we are being threatened
	befall'&quot; And Allah has answered it, saying: &quot;It will
	befall the disbelievers.&quot; But most of the commentators have
	taken sa'ala here in the meaning of demanding. Nasa'i and other
	traditionists have related a tradition from Ibn 'Abbas, and Hakim
	hold it as authentic, that Nadr bin al-Harith Kaladah had said &quot;O
	God, if it is really the Truth sent dawn by You, then rain down
	stones on us from the heavens, or send down any other painful
	torment on us.&quot; (AI-Anfal: 32). Apart from this, at several
	places in the Qur'an the disbelievers' this challenge has been
	related: &quot;Why don't you bring down on us the torment that you
	threaten us with?&quot; For instance, see Yunus: 4b-48, Al-Anbiya':
	36-41, An-Naml; 67-72, Saba: 26-30, Ya Sin: 45-52, Al-Mink: 24-27.&nbsp;

	Al-Hajj: 47, it has been said: &quot;These people are demanding of
	you to hasten the torment; Allah will never tail to fulfill His
	threat, but a day with your Lord is equal to a thousand years as you
	reckon.&quot; In Surah As-Sajdah: 5, it has been said: &quot;He
	administers the affairs of the world from the heavens to the earth,
	and the report of this administration ascends (to be presented)
	before Him in a Day whose length, according to your reckoning, is a
	thousand years&quot;. And here, in response to the demand for the
	torment, the measure of Allah's one day has been stated to be fifty
	thousand years. Then the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been
	consoled, saying: &quot;Have patience at the demand for the torment
	which the people make out of jest and fun,&quot; and then it is
	said: &quot;They think it is far off, but We see it as near at
	hand.&quot; When all these verses are read together, what becomes
	obvious is: &quot;The people, because of their narrow and restricted
	outlook, measure the time of Allah's decrees by their own scales of
	time and, therefore, consider a hundred years or so to be a very
	lengthy period, whereas in the Divine conduct of affairs there are
	schemes spreading over a thousand years each, or fifty thousand
	years each, as you reckon, and this measure also is only by way of
	example; otherwise schemes in the universe may extend over millions
	and billions of years as well. Of these one is the scheme under
	which Mankind has been created on the earth, and a time limit has
	been set during which it has been allowed to function here. No man
	can know when this scheme began, what time-limit has been decreed
	for its completion, what Hour has been appointed for bringing it to
	an end, when Resurrection will take place, and what time has been
	fixed for raising all men, born since the beginning of creation till
	Resurrection, from death simultaneously and calling them to account
	for their deeds. We only know to some extent that part of the scheme
	which is passing before us, or a partial history of the past ages
	which exists with us. As for its beginning and end, to say nothing
	of knowing it, we do not even have the power to understand it, not
	to speak of understanding the wisdom which works behind and
	underlies it. Now the people who demand that the scheme be cut short
	and its conclusion be brought immediately before them, and if this
	is not done. they use it for an argument to prove that the universe
	has no end and conclusion, in fact, present a proof of their own
	ignorance and folly. (For further explanation, see E.N.'s 92, 93 of

	Some people have understood this to mean that the &quot;due share&quot;

	accepted on the ground that the Surah AI-Ma`arij is unanimously a
	Makkan Revelation, and the zakat with its specific exemption limit
