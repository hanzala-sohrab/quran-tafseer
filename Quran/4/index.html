<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
Surah comprises several discourses which were revealed on different
occasions during the period ranging probably between the end of A.H.
3 and the end of A.H. 4 or the beginning of A.H. 5. Although it is
difficult to determine the exact dates of their revelations, yet it
is possible to assign to them a fairly correct period with the help
of the Commandments and the events mentioned therein and the
Traditions concerning them. A few instances are given below by way of

	many families at Al-Madinah. From this we conclude that vv. 1 -28
	were revealed on that occasion. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Let
us now consider the social and historical considerations of the
period in order to understand the Surah. All the discourses in this
Surah deal with three main problems which confronted the Holy Prophet
at the time. First of all, he was engaged in bringing about an all
round development of the Islamic Community that had been formed at
the time of his migration to Al-Madinah. For this purpose he was
introducing new moral, cultural, social, economic and political ways
in place of the old ones of the pre-Islamic period. The second thing
that occupied his attention and efforts was the bitter struggle that
was going on with the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">mushrik</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Arabs, the Jewish clans and the
hypocrites who were opposing tooth and nail his mission of reform.
Above all he had to propagate Islam in the face of the bitter
opposition of these powers of evil with a view to capturing more and
more minds and hearts. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Accordingly,
detailed instructions have been given for the consolidation and
strengthening of the Islamic Community in continuation of those given
in Al-Baqarah. Principles for the smooth running of family life have
been laid down and ways of settling family disputes have been taught.
Rules have been prescribed for marriage and rights of wife and
husband have been apportioned fairly and equitably. The status of
women in the society has been determined and the declaration of the
rights of orphans has been made laws and regulations have been laid
down for the division of inheritance, and instructions have been
given to reform economic affairs. The foundation of the penal code
has been laid down drinking has been prohibited, and instructions
have been given for cleanliness and purity. The Muslims have been
taught the kind of relations good men should have with their Allah
and fellow men. Instructions have been given for the maintenance of
discipline in the Muslim Community. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
moral and religious condition of the people of the Book has been
reviewed to teach lessons to the Muslims and to forewarn them to
refrain from following in their footsteps. The conduct of the
hypocrites has been criticized and the distinctive features of
hypocrisy and true faith have been clearly marked off to enable the
Muslims to distinguish between the two. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Arab clans and the neighboring Jews
and the hypocrites at home that they were threatening the Muslims on
all sides. At this critical juncture, Allah filled the Muslims with
courage and gave them such instructions as were needed during that
period of war clouds. In order to counteract the fearful rumors that
were being spread by the hypocrites and the Muslims of weak faith,
they were asked to make a thorough inquiry into them and to inform
the responsible people about them. Then they were experiencing some
difficulties in offering their salat during the expeditions to some
places where no water was available for performing their ablutions,
etc. In such cases they were allowed to cleanse themselves with pure
earth and to shorten the salat or to offer the &quot;Salat of Fear&quot;,
when they were faced with danger. Instructions were also given for
the solution of the puzzling problem of those Muslims who were
scattered among the unbelieving Arab clans and were often involved in
war. They were asked to migrate to Al-Madinah, the abode of Islam. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

Surah also deals with the case of Bani Nadir who were showing a
hostile and menacing attitude, in spite of the peace treaties they
had made with the Muslims. They were openly siding with the enemies
of Islam and hatching plots against the Holy Prophet and the Muslim
Community even at Al-Madinah itself. They were taken to task for
their inimical behavior and given a final warning to change their
attitude, and were at last exiled from Al-Madinah on account of their
misconduct. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Clear
instructions were also given regarding the attitude they should adopt
towards the non-belligerent clans. The most important thing needed at
that time was to prepare the Muslims for the bitter struggle with the
opponents of Islam. For this purpose greatest importance was attached
to their character building, for it was obvious that the small Muslim
Community could only come out successful, nay, survive, if the
Muslims possessed high moral character. They were, therefore,
enjoined to adopt the highest moral qualities and were severely
criticized whenever any moral weakness was detected in them. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

this Surah mainly deals with the moral and social reforms, yet due
attention has been paid to propagation of Islam. On the one hand, the
superiority of the Islamic morality and culture has been established
over that of the Jews, Christians and mushriks; on the other hand,
their wrong religious conceptions, their wrong morality and their
evil acts have been criticized to prepare the ground for inviting
them to the way of the Truth. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Side by side with these, they have been taught the importance of the

behalf in this worldly life but who will argue their case with Allah
on the Day of Resurrection? Or who will be their defender there? If
one does a sinful thing or wrongs himself in any way and afterwards
implores Allah's forgiveness, he will find Allah Forgiving and
Compassionate. But if one earns some evil (and does not repent), this
earning of his will bring due punishment on him, for Allah is All
Knowing, All-Wise. But he who commits an error or a sin, and then
lays the blame for it on an innocent person, surely burdens himself
with the guilt of calumny and a heinous sin. </FONT></FONT>

	introduction beautifully suits the subsequent laws and regulations

	from him the ttumatt race spread over the earth. Therefore they
	should strictly observe the ties and obligations of kin-ship. We
	learn from another part of the Qur'an that Adam was that &quot;single

	sprang up and spread over the earth. &quot;....and of the same

	Tradition of the Holy Prophet that is cited in support of this has a
	different meaning from what has been understood. The best thing,

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>The
	commentators ascribe three meanings to this: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a)
	Hadrat 'A ' ishah says that this was revealed to remedy an evil that
	was prevalent in the days of &quot;Ignorance.&quot; The guardians of
	the orphan girls used to marry them for their wealth and beauty,
	with the intention of keeping them under their power because they
	had no one to defend their cause; then they treated them unjustly
	without any fear. Therefore when they became Muslims, they had
	misgivings about marrying orphan girls. Accordingly, the Qur'an
	advised them to marry women of their choice other than orphan girls
	in their charge, if they feared that they would not be able to do
	justice to them. Verse 127 of this Surah also supports this comment.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b) In
	commenting on this, Hadrat Ibn-i-`Abbas and his disciple `Ikrimah
	assert that this Commandment was given to eradicate an injustice
	that was prevalent at that time. In pre-Islamic days, there was no
	limit to the number of wives and some people would marry even a
	dozen of them but when they could not meet the increasing expenses,
	they were forced to grab the property of their orphan nephews and
	other helpless relatives. Therefore, Allah restricted the maximum
	number of wives to four, and enjoined that this too, was subject to
	the condition that one should do justice to all of them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(c) Sa&AElig;id
	bin Jubair, Qatadah and some other commentators declare that this
	Command was given to safeguard the interests of wives. They say that
	even before the advent of Islam, injustice to the orphans was looked
	upon with disfavor, but in regard to wives, it was different; they
	would marry as many as they liked and would treat them cruelly and
	unjustly without any fear of the society or pangs of conscience.
	Therefore Allah warned them that they should refrain from doing
	injustice to their wives as they did in the case of the orphans.
	Therefore they should not marry more than four wives and that too,
	only if they would do justice to them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The words
	of the verse bear all the three meanings and probably all three are
	meant. Another meaning also can be: &quot;If you cannot treat the
	orphans justly as they normally should be, you may marry the women
	who have orphan children.&quot; &nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote5">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>The
	consensus of opinion of all the scholars of the Muslim law is that
	this verse limits the number of wives and prohibits the keeping of
	more than four at one and the same time. Traditions also support
	this. It is related that at the time when Ghailan, the chief of
	Ta`if, became a Muslim, he had nine wives. The Holy Prophet asked
	him to keep only four of them and divorce all the others. There is
	another instance of Naufal bin Mu`aviyah, who was ordered by the
	Holy Prophet to divorce one of his five wives. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It should
	also be noted that this verse restricts polygamy with the provision
	of justice to all the wives; therefore whoever abuses this
	permission without fulfilling the condition of justice and marries
	more wives than one tries to deceive Allah. The courts of an Islamic
	State are, therefore, empowered to enforce justice in order to
	rectify the wrong done to a wife or wives. At the same time it is
	absolutely wrong to conclude from the proviso of justice, attached
	to this Commandment, that this verse was really meant to abolish
	polygamy. This is not the view of the Qur'an, but of those Muslims
	who have been overawed by the Christians of the West. They say that
	the Qur'an is also against polygamy but it did trot abolish it
	directly because it did not consider it expedient at the time for
	the custom had become very common. Instead of this, it allows
	polygamy provided that justice is done to all the wives. As this
	condition is most difficult to fulfill, the recommendation is
	towards monogamy. Obviously, this way of thinking is the result of
	mental slavery, because polygamy in itself is not an evil for in
	some cases it becomes a real cultural and moral necessity. There are
	Borne people, who, even if they wished, cannot remain content with

	should be enforced and after this the inheritance should be divided.
	In E.N. 182 of Al-Baqarah, it has been stated that one has the right
	to bequeath by will one-third of the whole property. This has been
	permitted to enable a person to leave for a deserving relative or
	relatives, who are not entitled to inheritance, a part of the
	property. For instance, if there is an orphan grandson or a
	grand-daughter, or the widow of a son or an indigent brother or
	sister, or a brother's widow, or a nephew, or some other relative,
	who needs help, he may leave a part of the inheritance for such a
	one by means of his will. One is even allowed to leave by will a
	share for any deserving person or for public service. In short, the
	law regulates the distribution of two-thirds (or a little more) of
	one's inheritance and gives option for the disposal of the remaining
	(about one-third) by the special circumstances of one's own family.,

	When the master accepts his repentance, he turns to him kindly and

	during the period when it has not yet been weaned and it lives only
	on suckling, the prohibition shall be effective; but if it is

	Imam Shaafi `i, Imam Ahmad, Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad and Sufyan
	Thauri from among the jurists also agree to this. There is also a
	saying of Imam Abu Hanifah to the same effect. Imam Malik also
	agrees to this, but he says that the prohibition shall apply even if

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As there

	the slave-girls taken as prisoners of war, the following should be
	carefully studied: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) It is
	not lawful for a soldier to have conjugal relations with a prisoner
	of war as soon as she falls into his hands. The Islamic Law requires
	that all such women should be handed over to the government, which
	has the right to set them free or to ransom them, or to exchange
	them with the Muslim prisoners in the hands of the enemy, or
	distribute them among the soldiers. A soldier can cohabit only with
	that woman who has been formally given to him by the government. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) Even
	then, he shall have to wait for one monthly course before he can
	cohabit with her in order to ensure whether she is pregnant or not;
	otherwise it shall be unlawful to cohabit with her before delivery. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) It
	does not matter whether the female prisoner of war belongs to the
	people of the Book or not. Whatever her religion, she becomes lawful
	for the man to whom she is formally given. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) None
	but the one to own the slave-girl is given has the right to &quot;touch
	her.&quot; The offspring of such a woman from his seed shall be his
	lawful children and shall have the same legal rights as are given by
	the Divine Law to the children from one's loins. After the birth of
	a child she cannot be sold as a slave-girl and shall automatically
	become free after her master's death. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) If
	the master marries his slave-girl with another man, he forfeits his
	conjugal rights over her, but retains other rights such as service
	from her. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) The
	maximum limit of four has not been prescribed for slave-girls as in
	the case of wives for the simple reason that the number of female
	prisoners of war is unpredictable. The lack of limit does by no
	means provide a license for the well-to-do people to buy any number
	of slave-girls for licentious purposes. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) The
	proprietary rights over a slave, male or female, as given to a
	person by the government are transferable like all other legal
	proprietary rights. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(8) The
	handing over of the proprietary rights over a slave-girl to a man
	formally by the government makes her as much lawful for him as the
	giving of the baud of a free woman to a man by her parents or
	guardian through nikah (marriage ceremony). Therefore, there is no
	reason why a man who does not hold marriage in detestation should
	hold sexual intercourse with a slave-girl in detestation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(9) When
	once the government hands over the female prisoner of war to
	someone, it has no right whatever to take her back from him, just as
	the parent or guardian has no right to take back a woman after she
	is handed over to a man through nikah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(10) It
	should also be noted well that if a military commander temporarily
	distributes female prisoners of war among the soldiers for sexual
	purposes, or permits them to have sexual relations for the time
	being, such an act shall be unlawful and there is absolutely no
	difference between this and fornication, and fornication is a crime
	according to the Islamic code. (For detailed discussion please refer
	to my books, Tafhimat II and Rasa `il-o-Masa 'il I).

	relative; otherwise all Muslims are equal. As a matter of fact, the
	thing that distinguishes one Muslim from another is the quality of

<DIV ID="sdfootnote47">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote47sym" HREF="#sdfootnote47anc">46</A>It
	should be kept in view that in this section (vv. 2425) the Arabic
	word muhsanat has been used in two different senses: (1) &quot;wedded
	wives&quot;, enjoying the protection of their husbands; and (2)
	&quot;free Muslim women&quot; enjoying the protection of their
	families, even though they might not be married. This is important,
	because the lack of differentiation between these two meanings has
	given rise to a superficial complication. The Kharijites and those
	others who do not believe in the stoning of an adulterous woman have
	misconstrued this verse (25) to prove their own point of view. They
	argue that in this verse, the punishment prescribed for an
	adulterous married slave-girl is half of the punishment prescribed
	for a free &quot;married&quot; Muslim woman. If the punishment for
	an adulterous free married woman had been stoning to death, there
	could be no half of this punishment for a guilty slave-girl. Hence,
	this verse is, according to them, a conclusive proof that the
	punishment of stoning does not exist in Islam. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	fallacy of the above argument becomes obvious, if one uses common
	sense in the application of the appropriate meaning of muhsanat. In
	the case of the guilty slave-girl, it has been used in the sense of
	&quot;married woman&quot;, enjoying the protection of the husband,
	as is plain from the subsequent clause; &quot;after they have been
	fortified in wedlock&quot;. But in the case of the guilty Muslim
	woman, half of whose punishment is to be given, it means &quot;free
	Muslim woman&quot; enjoying the protection of her family, and does
	not mean a &quot;free married Muslim woman&quot;, as has been
	misconstrued by the opponents of the punishment of stoning. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the lighter punishment for an adulterous slave-girl than for
	a free Muslim woman, it is based on the fact that the latter enjoys
	double protection as compared with the former the protection of the
	family (even though she be unmarried) and the protection of the
	husband, which reinforces the protection of the family she already
	enjoys. In contrast to a free woman, a slave-girl does not enjoy any
	protection at all, if she is unmarried, and even after marriage her
	position does not become equal to that of an un-married free Muslim
	woman, for the latter enjoys the protection of her status, her
	family, her clan, etc. On the other hand, a slave-girl still
	remains, to some extent, under the bondage of slavery and has no
	protection of the family, clan, etc. Therefore, her punishment
	should be half of an un-married free woman and not half of a free
	married woman. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Furthermore
	this also shows that the punishment of one hundred stripes as
	prescribed in An-Nur, XXIV : 2, is for an un-married free Muslim
	woman guilty of fornication half of which has been prescribed here
	for a slave married girl. As for an adulterous married free woman
	she deserves capital punishment for this heinous crime because she
	enjoys the double protection of the family and of the husband, and
	that punishment is &quot;stoning her to death.&quot; Though the
	Qur'an does not explicitly mention the punishment of stoning to
	death, it does indicate it in a subtle manner, which the Holy
	Prophet understood and enforced. And who else could understand the
	Qur'an better? &nbsp;

	substance, by making fine and unnecessary distinctions, by
	introducing into it their own superstitious customs as laws, by
	imposing their own restrictions and hard conditions and making many
	lawful things unlawful. They, therefore, could not appreciate the
	simple rules and regulations that were being presented by the
	Qur'an. That is why their rabbis, scribes and common people did not
	accept the Qur'an as the Book of Allah. They were so upset by its

	accordingly the Holy Prophet instructed that during the monthly

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here it

	far as I have understood from a critical study of the Qur'an and the
	Sunnah (and the correct and right knowledge is only with Allah), I
	have .come to the conclusion that the following three things make a
	sin heinous: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	violation of the rights of Allah, or of parents, or of other human
	beings, or one's own rights. The wickedness of the sin increases in
	proportion to the sanctity of the right that is violated. That is
	why the Qur'an calls a sin Zulm (iniquity) and declares shirk to be
	a gross iniquity. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) A sin
	becomes heinous, if it is committed to defy the Divine Laws. This is
	because the offender deliberately, boldly and shamelessly discards
	the Commandments and Prohibitions of Allah and intentionally does
	that which He prohibits, merely for the sake of disobedience, and
	impudently does not do that which He has commanded. The gravity of
	this sin increases in proportion to the impudence that is shown
	towards Allah in disobeying and discarding His Law. That is why the
	Qur'an calls sin fisq (disobedience) and ma` siyat (arrogance). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	violation of those relations and the cutting off of those
	connections on the unification and integrity of which depends the
	peace of human life, makes a sin heinous whether these relations are
	between man and Allah or between man and man. The gravity of the sin
	of violation or the cutting off of a connection increases in
	proportion to the importance of the relation, and to the security
	contained in it. For instance, fornication in its different forms is
	in itself a heinous sin, for it corrupts human society. But in some
	forms it becomes far more heinous than in others. The sin of
	adultery committed by a married man is far more heinous than that
	committed by an unmarried man. Likewise, adultery with a married
	woman is a far greater sin than fornication with an unmarried woman.
	In the same way, sexual intercourse with the womenfolk of a
	neighbour is far more heinous than with others and incest with
	mother, sister or daughter become the most heinous sin conceivable
	because of the security and sanctity the relation provides. For the
	same reason the sin committed in the mosque is far more wicked than
	elsewhere. In the above instances, the difference in the gravity of
	the same sin is due to the difference in the nature of the sanctity
	of the relations and the security contained in them. This is why,
	sin is also called fujur (violation of relations).

	which, if observed, would bring great peace in the troubled social
	life of today. Allah has taught people not to be covetous for and be

	qualities of mind and body and another with other qualities. He has
	created one in straitened and another in opulent circumstances. He
	has provided one with ample resources and another with scanty ones.

	superiority in anything generates jealousy, cut-throat competition,

	authorized to cause separation between them, if required by
	circumstances. Likewise, Caliph `Ali appointed arbiters in a similar
	case and authorized them to effect reconciliation between the
	spouses or separate them. This shows that the arbiters as such do

<DIV ID="sdfootnote90">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote90sym" HREF="#sdfootnote90anc">89</A>This
	verse is the basis of the whole religious, cultural and political
	system of Islam and is the first and foremost article of the
	constitution of an Islamic State. It lays down permanently the
	following fundamental principles: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) In
	the Islamic system, Allah is the real Authority who must be obeyed.
	A Muslim is first of all the servant of Allah; all his other
	capacities come after this. Therefore, a Muslim as an individual and
	the Muslims as a community owe their first loyalty to Allah and they
	must subordinate all other loyalties to this. Allegiance and
	obedience to anyone else shall be acknowledged only if these are not
	opposed to the allegiance and obedience to Allah but are subordinate
	to it. All other allegiances that are opposed to this basic
	allegiance shall be broken asunder. The Holy Prophet has explained
	the same thing in a Tradition: &quot;There is no obedience to any of
	His creatures in what involves disobedience to the Creator.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	second fundamental principle of the Islamic system is allegiance and
	obedience to the Holy Prophet. This obedience is not inherent in
	Prophethood but is only practical shape of obedience to Allah. A
	Messenger is to be obeyed because he is the authentic means through
	which we can receive Commandments and instructions from Allah.
	Hence, we can obey Allah only by obeying His Messenger, for no other
	way of obedience is genuine. As a corollary of this, the breach of
	allegiance to the Messenger shall be a rebellion against the
	Sovereign, Whom he represents. A Tradition explains the same thing
	thus: &quot;Whoever obeys me, obeys Allah and whoever disobeys me,
	disobeys Allah.&quot; The same thing has also been explicitly stated
	in v. 80 of this Surah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) After
	the first and the second allegiance, and subordinate to these, the
	Muslims owe allegiance to those invested with authority from among
	themselves. The Arabic word ulil-amr is very comprehensive, which
	comprises all those persons who are in any way at the helm of the
	affairs of the Muslims-religious scholars, thinkers, political
	leaders, administrators, judges of law courts, tribal chiefs and the
	like. In short, all those, who are in any way invested with
	authority from among the Muslims, are to be obeyed, and it is not
	right to disturb the peace of the community life of the Muslims by
	entering into conflict with them, provided that (a) they are from
	among the Muslims, and (b) they are obedient to Allah and His
	Messenger. These two conditions are a pre-requisite for obedience to
	them, and these have been explicitly laid down in the verse and have
	also been fully explained by the Holy Prophet. In support of this
	some Traditions are cited below: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a) &quot;It
	is obligatory on a Muslim to listen to and obey orders of those
	invested with authority, whether he likes it or dislikes it,
	provided that it is not sinful. However, if he is ordered to do a
	sinful thing, he should neither listen to the rulers nor obey their
	orders.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b)
	&quot;Obedience to anyone in a sinful thing is forbidden. Obedience
	is obligatory only in what is right.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(c) The
	Holy Prophet said, &quot;There will be rulers over you who will
	practice right things as well as wrong things: (In such a case)
	whoever protests against the wrong things, shall be absolved from
	the responsibility and whoever dislikes the wrong things, also shall
	escape (punishment). But whoever approves of and follows them, shall
	incur punishment.&quot; The Companions asked, &quot;Should we not
	then fight against such rulers?&quot; The Holy Prophet answered,
	&quot;No, as long as they offer the Salat.&quot; (Muslim) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">That is,
	if they discard the Salat, it will be a clear proof of their
	disobedience to Allah and His Messenger. Then it will be right to
	rise against them 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(d) The
	Holy Prophet said, &quot;Your worst rulers are those whom you hate
	and who hate you, whom you curse and who curse you.&quot; The
	Companions asked, &quot;O Messenger of God, should we not rise
	against such rulers?&quot; The Holy Prophet answered, &quot;No, as
	long as they establish the Salat among you.&quot; (Muslim) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	Tradition, the condition about the Salat laid down in the preceding
	one, has been made more explicit. One might have inferred from (c)
	that if they offered the Salat in their individual capacities, no
	rising should be organized against them. But Tradition (d)
	explicitly lays down that the condition for obedience to those in
	authority is the establishment of the system of Salat by them in the
	Muslim Community. The rulers should not only themselves offer the
	Salat regularly, but they should also establish the Salat in the
	system of government run by them. This is the minimum condition that
	' makes a government Islamic in principle. If a government lacks
	this, it will mean that such a government has discarded Islam, and
	the Muslims will be justified in overthrowing it. This same thing
	has also been stated in another Tradition thus: &quot;The Holy
	Prophet took a covenant from us regarding certain things. One of
	these was that we would not engage in a dispute with those invested
	with authority unless we saw in them clear signs of disbelief, which
	may provide us with a cogent reason to present before Allah.&quot;
	(Bukhari, Muslim) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	fourth thing that has been laid down as an absolute and permanent
	principle is that the Commandments of Allah and the Sunnah of His
	Messenger are the fundamentals of law and final authority in the
	Islamic system. Hence, if a dispute arises about any matter between
	the Muslims or between the rulers and the ruled, they should turn to
	the Qur'an and the Sunnah for a decision and they should all submit
	to the decision. Thus, the essential element in the Islamic system
	that distinguishes it from un-Islamic systems is to acknowledge the
	Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger as the final authority
	and to turn to these and to submit to their decisions in all
	problems of life. Any system void of this is most surely an un
	lslamic system. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people doubt the soundness of this principle. They say that it fails
	in practical life for the simple reason that there are many aspects
	of life (e.g., Local Self department. Railway department, Postal
	department, etc. etc.,) for which there are no rules and regulations
	at all in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. How
	then can they find the solution of the problems they meet with in
	such aspects of life as concern such departments? This doubt arises
	because they do not, understand the fundamental principles of Islam.
	Islam allows freedom of action in all those things about which the
	Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger are silent. What
	distinguishes a Muslim from a non-Muslim is that the latter claims
	absolute freedom but the former considers himself to be the servant
	of Allah and uses only that amount of freedom which Islam allows
	him. The non-Muslim judges all matters in accordance with the rules
	and regulations made by himself and does not believe that he stands
	in need of Divine Guidance. In contrast to him, the Muslim, first of
	all, turns to Allah and His Messenger for guidance about everything
	and abides by their decision. But if he does not find any
	commandment therein about a certain thing, only then he is free to
	act in a manner he considers to be right. The very fact that the Law
	is silent about a certain thing, is a proof that it allows freedom
	of action in that particular matter. &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote91sym" HREF="#sdfootnote91anc">90</A>In
	the first part of this verse, the Qur'an enunciates the tour
	fundamental principles of the Islamic Constitution, and in the
	second part teaches the wisdom that underlies them. The Muslims have
	been enjoined to follow the four fundamental principles if they are
	true believers; otherwise their profession of Islam will become
	doubtful. Then they have been taught to build their system of life
	on these because therein also lies their well-being; for this alone
	can keep them on the right path in this world and lead them to a
	happy life in the Hereafter. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It should
	also be noted that this piece of advice follows the critical review
	of the moral and religious condition of the Jews and warns the
	Muslims in a subtle manner to learn a lesson from their deplorable
	condition. It says that whenever a community flings the Book of
	Allah and the guidance of His Messenger behind its back and follows
	such leaders as are disobedient to Allah and His Messenger, and
	blindly obeys its rulers and religious leaders without demanding
	from thetas the authority of the Book and the Sunnah, it can never
	escape those evils in which the children of Israel were involved.

	this verse, Taghut clearly stands for the authority that makes
	decisions in accordance with laws other than Divine and the system
	of judiciary which acknowledges neither Allah as the Supreme
	Sovereign nor His Book as the final authority. Hence, this verse is
	explained that it is contrary to Faith to take one's case for
	decision to a law court which by its nature is, that of taghut
	Belief in Allah and His Book makes it obligatory on the Believer
	that he should refuse to acknowledge such a court as lawful.
	According to the Qur'an, belief in Allah and disbelief in taghut are

	by him only should be followed instead of all other codes, and the
	commandments brought by him from Allah only should be obeyed instead
	of all other commandments. If anyone does not acknowledge the

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, it
	means that those very people who were then showing cowardice were
	very impatient to fight before permission was given for this. They
	would repeat the tales of their persecution and oppression and say,
	&quot;Give us permission to fight, for we have no more patience left
	to bear these wrongs. &quot; At that time when they were advised to
	be patient for the time being and to purify themselves by means of
	Salat and Zakat, they would resent such pieces of advice. But when
	the Command to fight was given, some of those very people began to
	show cowardice when they confronted the enemy armies and the dangers
	of war. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second meaning is that those people were very 'religious' as long as
	such harmless demands as the offering of Salat and the payment of
	Zakat were made; but no sooner was the demand to fight in the way of
	Allah made on them than they were filled with terror and fear for
	their lives, and they forgot all about their religiosity. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	meaning is that during the pre-Islamic period, they were ready to
	fight for the sake of the spoils or for the gratification of their
	whims, and were engaged day and night in war. That is why, after
	embracing Islam, they were enjoined to desist a while from fighting
	and to reform their souls by means of the Salat and Zakat. But when
	they were enjoined to fight in the way of Allah, the same people who
	showed reckless bravery in fighting for the sake of false pride,
	were showing timidity, and those who were dare-devils turned into
	milksops and shirked fight.

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	importance of the salutation of peace as a symbol of recognition was
	specially great at that time because there was no apparent mark of
	distinction between a Muslim Arab and a non-Muslim Arab, as they
	wore the same kind of dress and spoke the semi language. Still a
	difficulty arose when the Muslims attacked some clan and a local
	Muslim also became the target of attack. Then he would cry out,
	Asalam-u-alaikum or La llaha illallah (there is no god but Allah).
	But the attacking Muslims would suspect him to be a disbeliever who
	was using the password as a trick merely to save his life. They
	would, therefore, often kill him and take possession of his
	belongings as spoils. Although the Holy Prophet would severely
	admonish the offenders on such occasions, yet there was a recurrence
	of such incidents. Then Allah solved the difficulty in this verse,
	which means, &quot;You have no right to judge cursorily that the
	man, who is declaring himself to be a Muslim, is telling a lie
	merely to save his life. It is equally possible that he may be
	speaking the truth, or telling a lie, and one cannot know the
	reality without making a thorough investigation. Thus, while there
	is a chance of letting off a disbeliever by accepting his
	salutations of peace as genuine, there is also the more horrible
	chance of killing an innocent Believer. In any case, it is far
	better to let off a disbeliever by mistake than to kill a Reliever
	by error.

	shortening of the obligatory part of the Salat during a journey in
	peace time is, `to reduce four rak'ats to two rak`ats&quot;but there
	is no prescribed limit to the reduction during actual fighting. The
	Salat must be offered any-how in any form as the circumstances on
	the occasion permit. If it is possible to offer the Salat in
	congregation, it should be offered in congregation; otherwise the
	soldiers should say it individually. If it is not possible to turn
	the face to the qiblah, it may be offered facing any other
	direction. If it is not possible to remain stationary for the Salat,
	it may be offered while riding or walking. If it is not possible to
	bend down or prostrate, one should do so symbolically. If, during
	the Salat, it becomes necessary to move from that place, one may
	continue the Prayer even during the movement. There is no harm in
	offering the Salat, even if one's clothes become stained with blood.
	And even if in spite of all these concessions, it is not possible to
	offer it at all, it may then be reluctantly postponed, as was done
	during the course of the &quot;Battle of the Trench.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is
	a difference of opinion as to whether the obligatory parts (fara
	`id) only are to be offered in a journey or those parts (sunnats)
	also that were practised by the Holy Prophet in addition to the
	former. When on a journey the Holy Prophet used to offer without
	fail two rak`ats in addition to the obligatory rak`ats of
	Salat-ul-Fajr (Morning Prayers) and three rak`ats of witr with
	Salat-ul- 'Isha' (Night Prayer). At other times he only offered the
	obligatory parts; there is no proof of his offering the sonnet
	parts. He, however, used to offer &quot;additional prayers&quot;
	(nawafil), whenever he got time for these even while he was riding.
	That is why Hadrat 'Abdullah bin `Umar prohibited the people from
	offering the sunnats during a journey except with the Morning
	Prayer. But the majority of the scholars leave it to the
	individual's option to offer or not to offer the sunnats on a
	journey. The Hanafis are of the opinion that it is better to leave
	them during the actual journey but one must offer them at a halting
	place, if one can get the necessary peace of mind. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the nature of the journey in which the Salat may be
	shortened,some scholars (Ibn 'Umar, Ibn Mas'ud and 'Ata) have
	imposed the condition that it should he in the way of Allah, e.g.,
	for Jihad, Hajj, `Umrah, or in quest of knowledge, etc. Imam Shafi'i
	and Imam Ahmad are of the opinion that the journey should be for
	some lawful purpose; otherwise one has no right of enjoying the
	concession of reduction in Salat. The Hanafi s are of the opinion
	that the Salat may be shortened during any kind of journey,
	irrespective of the purpose for which it is undertaken. As regards
	the nature of the journey, it may merit reward or punishment by
	itself, but it does not affect the concession of reduction in Salat.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some of
	the Imams have interpreted words &quot;there is no harm&quot; to
	mean that &quot;reduction in the Prayer&quot; is not obligatory but
	merely optional. One may make use of the permission and shorten his
	Salat or may not. Imam Shafi'i holds the same view, though he
	considers it better to shorten it. He is of the opinion that one who
	does not make use of the &quot;reduction&quot;, gives up the higher
	thing and adopts a lower thing. Imam Ahmad is of the opinion that
	although &quot;reduction&quot; is not obligatory, yet it is improper
	not to make use of the concession. Imam Abu Hanifah considers
	&quot;reduction&quot; obligatory and there is also a tradition from
	Imam Malik to the same effect. All the traditions from the Holy
	Prophet show that in his Journeys he always shortened his Salat and
	there is no authentic Tradition to show that he ever offered four
	rak`ats on a journey. Ibn `Umar says, &quot;During the journeys I
	accompanied the Holy Prophet, Abu Bakr, `Umar or ` Uthman (may Allah
	be pleased with them all), and I witnessed that they always
	shortened their Salat and never offered four rak`ats. &quot; The
	same view is also supported by authentic traditions from Ibn `Abbas
	and several other Companions. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Once
	during Hajj, Hadrat `Uthman performed four rak ats while he was
	leading the Salat at Mina and the Companions objected to it. He
	satisfied them, saying, &quot;I have taken a wife from Makkah and I
	have heard from the Holy Prophet that whoever marries at a place
	becomes a citizen of that place. Therefore I have . not shortened my
	prayer.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There
	are, however, two traditions against this from Hadrat `A'ishah which
	show that it is equally right to make a &quot;reduction&quot; in the
	Salat or to say it in full. But these traditions are weak in
	authenticity and contrary to her own practice, for she herself
	practiced &quot;reduction&quot;. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, it may also be noted that sometimes one feels oneself to
	be &quot;on a journey&quot; as well as &quot;at home&quot; when one
	may shorten the Salat or offer it in full at one and the same
	halting place according to the circumstances. Most probably Hadrat
	`A'ishah referred to such a state, saying: &quot;When on a journey,
	the Holy Prophet sometimes shortened his Salat and sometimes offered
	it in full. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the words, &quot;There is no harm if you shorten your
	Prayer&quot;, it is not correct to conclude that the &quot;Command&quot;
	is optional. The same words have been used in connection with
	running between Safa and Marwa on the occasion of Hajj, in verse 158
	of Al-Baqarah, although this is an essential part of Hajj. As a
	matter of fact, these words have been used in both the places to
	allay the fear that shortening of the Prayer or running between Safa
	and Marwa might entail a sin or lessen one's rewards. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the length of the journey, the Zahirites are of the opinion
	that &quot;reduction&quot; may be made in any journey irrespective
	of the distance. According to Imam Malik, the minimum distance of
	the journey should be 48 miles, or its duration should be at least
	one day and one night. Hadrat Ibn `Abbas and Imam Ahmad are also of
	the same opinion and a saying of Imam Shafi`i also supports the
	same. But the minimum distance for &quot;reduction&quot; according
	to Hadrat Anas is 15 miles, while Imam Auza`i and Imam Zuhri follow
	the opinion of Hadrat `Umar that one day's journey suffices for
	&quot;reduction&quot; . According to Hadrat Hasan Basri and Imam Abu
	Yusuf, the minimum journey of two days entitles one to shorten one's
	Salat. Imam Abu Hanifah is of the opinion that &quot;reduction&quot;
	may be made in a journey of a minimum distance of 54 miles. The same
	is the opinion of Ibn `Umar, Ibn Mas`ud and Hadrat `Uthman (may
	Allah be pleased with them all). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Opinions
	differ regarding the &quot;reduction&quot; in a halt during the
	course of a journey. Imam Ahmad is of the opinion that if one
	intends to halt at a place for four days, one will have to offer the
	Prayer in full. According to Imam Malik and lmam Shafe`i,
	&quot;reduction&quot; is not lawful at a place where one intends to
	halt for more than four days. Imam Auza`i extends it to 13 days and
	Imam Abu Hanifah to 15 days or more and enjoins offering of the full
	Prayer during such a halt. But there is no explicit command of the
	Holy Prophet about this. However, there is a consensus of opinion
	that if one is forced by circumstances to halt at a place but
	intends to leave it for home at any time, one may go on practising
	&quot;reduction&quot; for an indefinite period of time. There are
	instances when some Companions practiced &quot;reduction&quot;
	continuously even for two years for the same reason. Imam Ahmad bin
	Hanbal allows a prisoner to make &quot;reduction&quot; during the
	whole term of his imprisonment. &nbsp;

	`Umar presented the same objection before the Holy Prophet, he
	answered, &quot;The concession of 'reduction' is a bounty from

	no justice among the Muslims; they practice prejudices and

	have been taught that they should not allow partisanship to stand in

	things: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) You
	should never be under the delusion that you can make or mar the fate
	of any one, and that if you withdraw or withhold your help and
	support from anyone, that person will become utterly helpless. As a
	matter of fact, your own fate and the fate of those whom you
	support, is entirely in the hands of Allah and you alone are not the
	only means by which He supports His servants or maid servants. The
	resources of the Owner of the earth and the heavens are vast and
	limitless and He is also All-Wise and has full power to adopt means
	for helping anyone He wills. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) Allah
	has enjoined you, as He always enjoined the communities of the
	former Prophets, to conduct your affairs with fear of God in your
	hearts. In this lies your own good and not of God. If you do not
	carry out these instructions, you can do no harm to Allah but you
	yourselves will go the way of the former disobedient communities.
	The Sovereign of the Universe has never stood in need of the people.
	If you will not behave properly, He will remove you from leadership
	and appoint another community in your place. And your removal will
	not in the least diminish anything from the greatness of His
	Kingdom. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) Allah
	has in His possession all the benefits and rewards of this world and
	of the Next World, benefits which are temporary and transitory or
	permanent and ever-lasting. It is for you to make your choice from
	among these according to your own capacity and courage. If you are
	enamored of the temporary good things of this world and are even
	prepared to sacrifice the permanent blessings of the Hereafter,
	Allah will bestow upon you the same here and now, but in that case,
	you will have no portion in the permanent blessings of the
	Hereafter. You should not forget that owing to your own lack of
	capability and lack of courage, you have chosen to acquire only a
	drop out of the ocean of the blessings of God. Therefore it is
	better for you to adopt that way of obedience and submission which
	may enable you to acquire the vast benefits of this world and of the
	Hereafter.

	concluding words of this piece of admonition, &quot;He hears
	everything and sees everything&quot;, have a very deep significance.
	As Allah is neither deaf nor blind, He makes a fine distinction
	between the good and the bad in the distribution of His blessings.
	He is fully aware of what is happening in the universe over which He
	is ruling and of the capabilities, efforts and intentions of
	everyone. Therefore, one who is disobedient to Him, should not
	expect those blessings which He has reserved for those who are
	obedient to Him.

	one's being a sincere Believer or a hypocrite because during the

	of his lack of interest, and expels him from it for continuous
	absence, so if a Muslim absented himself from the Salat in
	congregation, it was considered a clear sign of his lack of interest
	in Islam. And if he continuously absented himself from it, this was
	taken as a proof of his desertion from Islam. That is why even the
	confirmed hypocrites of that time had to join the Salat in
	congregation five times a day; otherwise they could not be counted
	as members of the Islamic Community. But what distinguished them
	from the true Believers was that the true Believers went to the

	after the Prayer was over which was a clear proof of their genuine
	interest in it. On the other hand, the very call to the Prayer
	sounded like a death knell to a hypocrite. He would rise up
	reluctantly to join the congregation, but his whole demeanor clearly
	showed that he was offering his Salat unwillingly. Then after the
	Prayer he would leave the mosque in haste as if he had been released
	from prison. Thus, all his movements showed that he had no interest

	declares that no human being has the power to guide to the right way
	the one who himself does not intend to get guidance from the Book of
	Allah and the excellent pattern of His Messenger; whom Allah turns
	to the wrong way to which he himself is inclined and shuts all the
	doors of guidance against him because of his own quest for
	deviation. And this happens in accordance with the Divine Law that
	man gets what he seeks and strives for. For instance, if one seeks
	to make one's provisions by lawful means and strives for the same,
	God provides lawful means for him and shuts unlawful doors against
	him, in proportion to the intensity of the sincerity of his
	intention. On the contrary, if one has the intention of making one's
	provisions by unlawful means and strives for the same, Allah
	provides him with the same through unlawful means. Allah alone has
	the power to guide any individual on any way whatsoever, and no one
	can take any course, right or wrong, without His permission and
	without His help, but He allows and helps every one to proceed on
	the way he chooses for himself. If one loves Allah and is a seeker
	after Truth and sincerely strives to follow His way, He allows him
	and helps him to think and act on the right lines leading to the
	right way and provides means for him to proceed on the same way. But
	if one chooses to follow wrong ways and strives to proceed on wrong
	ways, Allah shuts the way of guidance against him and opens before
	him evil ways which he chooses for himself. No one has the power to
	prevent such a one from evil thoughts and evil deeds and from
	spending his energies in evil ways. It is thus obvious that none can
	guide to the right way the wretched one who deliberately loses it
	and whom Allah leads astray in consequence of his intentional

	about his miraculous birth without father, because God had caused
	the whole Community to stand as witness to the miracle. When Virgin
	Mary, who belonged to the noble and well-known religious family of
	the Israelites, came home with the new-born child, a large crowd
	gathered there and demanded an explanation from her. But she simply
	pointed to the child. The crowd could not understand how a child in

	Allah has told the fact of the matter. The Qur'an explicitly states
	that the Jews did not succeed in putting Jesus to death and that
	Allah raised him to Himself, but it is silent about the nature and
	details of the matter and does neither say explicitly whether Allah
	raised him body and soul together from the earth to some place in

	more explicit words would have been used. In the first case, more
	appropriate words would be: &quot;No doubt they did not slay him nor
	crucified him but Allah rescued him alive from them and then gave

	to dishonor him by crucifixion, but Allah raised him very high in

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Third, if
	the incident related here meant merely the natural death of Christ,
	the words, &quot;And Allah is All-Powerful and All-Wise&quot;, after

	in connection with some extraordinary manifestation of the power and
	wisdom of Allah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The only
	argument that can be cited in support of the interpretation of verse
	158 that Jesus died a natural death is the use of the word
	mutawaffika in verse 55 of A1-`Imran, in connection with the
	incident. But as we have explained in the corresponding E.N. 51, the
	word is not explicit in the meaning of natural death but can be
	applied both to take the soul and to take the body and soul
	together. As there is scope for both the interpretations in this
	word, its use cannot refute the above mentioned arguments against
	the meaning: &quot;Allah caused his death&quot;. Those who insist on
	this interpretation argue that there is no other instance in which
	tawaffa might have been used for the seizure of both body and soul
	together. This is meaningless, for this is the only incident of its
	kind in the whole human history. The only thing to be considered is
	whether this word may lexically be used in this sense or not. If it
	can be used, we have to face the question: Why does the Qur'an not
	use a direct word for death instead of a word which is liable to
	support the doctrine of Ascension, which its turn, has given rise to
	the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus'? The use of this word is a
	clear proof that there was something extraordinary about the
	incident. Above all, the doctrine of Ascension is further
	strengthened by the Traditions according to which the Prophet Jesus,
	son of Mary, will come again to the earth before the Resurrection
	and fight the Dajjal. (These Traditions have been cited in the
	Appendix to the commentary of Surah Al Ahzab). These categorically
	prove the second coming of Jesus. Therefore, it would be snore
	rational to believe that he is living somewhere in the universe
	before this second coming than that he lies dead and buried
	somewhere before his advent. &nbsp;

	is a consensus of opinion that this refers to the inheritance of
	sisters and brothers who have the relation of common parents or only
	common father with the deceased. Once Hadrat Abu Bakr gave this-
