<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most
of the commentators, including Allama Zamakhshari, Imam Razi, Qadi,
Baidawi, Allama Nizam ad-Din Nisaburi, Hafiz Ibn Kathir and many
others, regard it as a Makki Surah, and, according to Allama Alusi,
the same is the opinion of the majority of scholars. However, some
commentators hold the view that the Surah was revealed at Madinah,
and some others say that it was revealed at Makkah but vv. 8-10 of it
were sent down at Madinah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
far as the subject matter and the style of the Surah are concerned,
these are very different from those of the Madani Surahs. A little
study of it rather shown that it is not only a Makki Surah but it was
revealed during the earliest period at Makkah, which began just after
the revelation of the first seven verses of Surah Al-Muddaththir. As
for vv 8-10, they are so naturally set in the theme of the Surah that
if they are read in their proper context, no one can say that the
theme preceding and following them had been sent down 15 to 16 years
earlier but these three verses which were revealed many years later
were inserted here unnaturally. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">In
fact, the basis of the idea that this Surah; or some verses of it
were revealed at Madinah, is a tradition which has related from Ibn
Abbas (may Allah bless him). He says that once Hadrat Hasan and
Husain fell ill The Holy Prophet and some of his Companions visited
them. They wished Hadrat Ali to make a vow to Allah for the recovery
of the two children. Thereupon, Hadrat Ali, Hadrat Fatimah and Fiddah
their maid servant, vowed a fast of three days if Allah restored the
children to health. The children recovered by the grace of Allah and
the three of them began to fast as avowed. As there was nothing to
eat in the house, Hadrat Ali borrowed three measures (sa') of barley
from somebody (according to another tradition, earned through labor).
When on the first day they sat down to eat after breaking the fast, a
poor man came and begged for food. They gave all their food to him,
drank water and retired to bed. The next day when they again sat down
to eat after breaking the fast, an orphan came and begged for
something. They again gave away the whole food to him, drank water
and went to bed. On the third day when they were just going to eat
after breaking the fast, a captive came up and begged for food
likewise. Again the whole food was given away to him. On the fourth
day Hadrat Ali took both the children with him and went before the
Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). The Holy Prophet (on whom be
peace) seeing the weak condition of the three, returned with them to
the house of Hadrat Fatimah and found her lying in a corner half dead
with hunger. This moved him visibly. In the meantime the Angel
Gabriel (peace be on him) came and said; &quot;Look, Allah has
congratulated you on the virtues of the people of your house!&quot;When
the Holy Prophet asked what it was, he recited this whole Surah in
response. (According to Ibn Mahran's tradition, he recited it from
verse 5 till the end. But the tradition which Ibn Marduyah has
related from Ibn Abbas only says that the verse </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Wa
yut'imun-at ta'am...</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">was sent down concerning Hadrat Ali
and Hadrat Fatimah; there is no mention of this story in it). This
whole story has been narrated by Ali bin Ahmad al-Wahidi in his
Commentary of the Qur'an, entitled </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Al'Basit</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
and probably from the same it has been taken by Zamakhshari, Razi,
Nisaburi and others. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">In
the first place, this tradition is very weak as regards its chain of
transmission. Then, from the point of view of its subject matter
also, it is strange that when a poor man, or an orphan, or a captive,
comes to beg for food, he is given all the food. He could be given
one member's food and the five of them could share the rest of it
among themselves:Then this also is incredible that illustrious
persons like Hadrat Ali and Hadrat Fatimah, who possessed perfect
knowledge of Islam, should have regarded it as an act of virtue to
keep the two children, who had just recovered their health and were
still weak, hungry for three consecutive days. Moreover, in respect
of the captives also, it has never been a practice under the Islamic
government that they should be left to beg for food for themselves.
For if they were prisoners of the government, the government itself
was responsible to arrange food and clothing for them, and if they
were in an individual's custody, he was made responsible to feed and
clothe them. Therefore, it was not possible that in Madinah a captive
should have gone about begging food from door to door. However,
overlooking the weaknesses of transmission and the probability of
subject matter, even if the narrative is accepted as it goes, at the
most what it shows is that when the people of the Holy Prophet's
house acted righteously as they did, Gabriel came and gave him the
good news that Allah had much appreciated their act of virtue, for
they had acted precisely in the righteous way that Allah had
commanded in these verses of Surah Ad-Dahr. This does not necessitate
that these verses too were sent down on that very occasion. The same
is the case with many traditions concerning the occasion of
revelation. When about a certain verse it is said that it was sent
down on a particular occasion, it in fact does not mean that the
verse was sent down on the very occasion the incident took place. But
it means that the verse applies precisely and exactly to the
incident. Imam Suyuti in </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Al-Itqan</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">has quoted this from Hafiz Ibn
Taimiyyah: &quot;When the reporters say that a verse was sent down
concerning a particular incident, it sometimes implies that the same
incident (or matter) occasioned its revelation, and sometimes that
the verse applies to the matter although it may not have occasioned
its revelation.&quot;Further on he quotes Imam Badr ad-Din Zarkashi's
view from his </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Al-Burhan
fi Ulum al-Quran</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">:&quot;It
is well known in respect of the Companions and their immediate
successors that when one of them says that a verse was sent down
concerning a particular matter, it means that the ruling contained in
it applied to that matter and not that the matter itself occasioned
the revelation of the verse. Thus, it only uses the ruling of the
verse for the purpose of reasoning and not for stating a fact.&quot;

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
theme of this Surah is to inform man of his true position in the
world and to tell him that if he understood his true position rightly
and adopted the attitude of gratefulness, he would meet with such and
such good end, and if he adopted the way of disbelief, he would meet
with such and such evil ends In the longer Surahs of the Qur'an this
same theme has been presented at length, but a special characteristic
of the style of the earliest Surahs revealed at Makkah is that the
subjects dealt with at length in the later period, &quot;have been
presented in a brief but highly effective way in this period in such
concise, elegant sentences as may automatically be preserved in the
memory of the hearers. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this Surah, first of all man has been reminded that there was a time
when he was nothing; then a humble beginning of him was made with a
mixed drop of sperm and ovum of which even his mother was not aware;
even she did not know that he had been conceived nor anyone else
seeing the microscopic cell could say that it was a man, who in
future would become the best of creation on the earth. After this,
man has been warned, so as to say: &quot;Beginning your creation in
this way We have developed and shaped you into what you are today in
order to test and try you in the world. That is why, unlike other
creatures, you were made intelligent and sensible and were shown both
the way of gratitude and the way of ingratitude clearly so that you
may show, in the interval that you have been granted here for work,
whether you have emerged as a grateful servant from the test or an
unbelieving, Un- grateful wretch!&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,

fate to be met with in the Hereafter by those who emerged as
unbelievers from this test. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this, in vv. 5-22 continuously, the blessings with which those who do
full justice to servitude in the world, will be favored, have been
mentioned in full detail. In these verses, not only have their best
rewards been mentioned but they have also been told briefly what are
the acts on the basis of which they would become worthy of those
rewards. Another special characteristic of the earliest Surahs
revealed at Makkah is that besides introducing in them briefly the
fundamental beliefs and concepts of Islam, here and there, those
moral qualities and virtuous acts have been mentioned, which are
praiseworthy according to Islam, and also those evils of deed and
morality of which Islam strives to cleanse human life. And these two
things have not been mentioned with a view to show what good or evil
result is entailed by them in the transitory life of the world, but
they have been mentioned only to point out what enduring results they
will produce in the eternal and everlasting life of the Hereafter,
irrespective of whether an evil quality may prove useful or a good
quality may prove harmful in the world. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
is the subject matter of the first section (vv. 1-22). In the second
section, addressing the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace), three
things have been stated: first, that &quot;it is in fact We Ourself
Who are revealing this Qur'an piecemeal to you, and this is intended
to inform the disbelievers, not you, that the Qur'an is not being
fabricated by Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) but
it is &quot;We Who are revealing it, and it is Our Own wisdom which
requires that We should reveal it piece by piece and not all at
once.&quot;Second, the Holy Prophet has been told: &quot;No matter
how long ,it may take for the decree of your Lord to be enforced and
no matter what afflictions may befall you in the meantime, in any
case you should continue to perform your mission of Apostleship
patiently, and not to yield to the pressure tactics of any of these
wicked and unbelieving people.&quot;The third thing he has been told
is: &quot;Remember Allah day and night, perform the Prayer and spend
your nights in the worship of Allah, for it is these things which
sustain and strengthen those who call to Allah in the face of
iniquity and disbelief.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
in one single sentence, the actual cause of the disbelievers wrong
attitude has been stated: they have forgotten the Hereafter and are
enamored of the world. In the second sentence, they have been warned
to the effect: &quot;You have not come into being by yourself: We
have created you. You have not made these broad chests, and strong,
sturdy hands and feet for yourselves, it is We Who made these for
you; and it so lies in Our power to treat you as We please. We can
distort your figures, We can destroy you and replace you by some
other nation. We can cause you to die and can recreate you in
whatever form We like.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, it has been said: This is an Admonition: whoever wills
may accept it and take a path to his Lord. But man's own will and
desire is not everything in the world. No one's will and desire can
be fulfilled unless Allah (also) so wills. And Allah's willing is not
haphazard: whatever He wills, He wills it on the basis of His
knowledge and wisdom. He admits into His mercy whomever He regards as
worthy of His mercy on the basis of His knowledge and wisdom, and He
has prepared a painful torment for those whom He finds unjust and
wicked. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>Most
	of the commentators and translators have taken hal in the first
	sentence hal ata alal-insan-i, in the meaning of qad. Accordingly,
	they interpret this sentence to mean; &quot;No doubt, there has
	indeed passed on man a time.&quot; But, in fact, the word hal in
	Arabic is used only as an interrogative particle, and its object is
	not to ask a question in every case, but this apparently
	interrogative particle is used in different meanings on different
	occasions. For example, sometimes, in order to find out whether a
	certain incident has taken place or not, we ask: &quot;Has this
	thing happened?&quot; Sometimes we do not mean to ask a question but
	to deny something and we express the denial, thus: &quot;Can any
	other also do this?&quot; Sometimes we want somebody to affirm
	something and so ask him: &quot;Have I paid what was due to you? And
	sometimes we do not intend to have something just affirmed but we
	put a question in order to make the addressee pay particular
	attention to something which follows his affirmation as a sequel.
	For example, we ask someone: &quot;Have I harmed you in any way'?&quot;
	The object is not only to make him affirm that one has not done him
	any harm, but also to make him think how far one is justified to
	harm somebody who has not harmed him in any way. The interrogative
	sentence in the verse before us illustrates this last meaning. The
	object is not only to make man affirm that there has indeed passed
	on him such a period of time but also to make him think that the God
	Who developed and shaped him into a perfect man from an
	insignificant, humble beginning, would not be helpless to create him
	once again. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	second sentence, hin um-min ad-dahr the word dahr implies the
	endless time, the beginning and end of which are unknown to man and
	here is the particular period of tune which might at some time have
	passed during this endless period. What is meant to be said is that
	in this immensely long span of time there has passed a long period
	when human race was altogether non-existent. Then a time came in it
	when a species called Man was created, and in the same period a time
	has passed on every person when a beginning was made to bring him
	into existence from nothingness. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	sentence, &quot;when he was not yet a thing worthy of mention&quot;
	implies that a part of him existed in the form of a microscopic gene
	in the sperm drop of the father and a part in the form of a
	microscopic ovum in the mother. For long ages man did not even know
	that he comes into being when the sperm gene and the ovum combine.
	Now both have been observed by means of powerful microscopes but
	even now no one can say how much of man exists in the father's germ
	and how much in the mother's ovum. Then, the initial cell that comes
	into being by the combination of the two at the time of conception
	is such an insignificant thing that it can be seen only through
	highly powerful microscopes and seeing it also no one at first sight
	can claim that it is a man taking shape, nor that even if a man
	emerges from this humble beginning, what will be his size and
	stature, what will be his form and figure, and what will be his
	capabilities and personality like. This is the meaning of the
	sentence that at that tithe he was not yet a thing worthy of any
	mention although a beginning of his being as a man had been made.</P>

	for man. He is not like the trees and animals that the object of his
	creation be fulfilled on the earth itself, and he should die and
	perish here after he has played his appointed role over a period of
	time according to the law of nature. Furthermore, this world is
	neither a place of punishment for him, as the monks think, nor a
	place of rewards as the believers of the law of transmigration
	think, nor a place of entertainment and enjoyment, as the
	materialists think, nor a battlefield, as the followers of Darwin
	and Marx think, but in fact it is a place of test and trial for him.
	That which he regards as his age, is in fact the time given him for
	the test. Whatever powers and capabilities he has been given in the
	world, the thing, that have been placed under his control and
	authority, the various positions and capacities in which he
	functions, and the relationships that he enjoys with other men, all
	these are the countless papers of the test and this test continues
	till the last breath of his life. The result is not to be announced
	in this world but in the Hereafter when all his answer-books will
	have been assessed, decision will be given whether he has come out
	successful or failed. And his success or failure wholly depends on
	what he thought of himself while he functioned here and how he
	answered the papers that were given him here. If he believed that he
	had no God, or that he was the slave of many gods, and while
	answering the papers thought that he was not to be held accountable
	before his Creator in the Hereafter, his whole lifework went wrong.
	And if he regarded himself as the slave of One God and worked in the
	way approved by God, with the accountability of the Hereafter always
	in view, he stood successful in the test. (This theme has occurred
	at many places in the Qur'an and has been dealt with at length in
	the corresponding notes. It is not possible to give all the
	references, but those who are interested in it may see the
	explanation of it in its different aspects under &quot;Test and
	Trial&quot; in the Index. In no other book beside the Qur'an has
	this truth been explained at such length ) .&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>The
	word sami' (hearing) and basir (seeing) in the original actually
	imply being &quot;sensible and intelligent&quot;. These words of the
	Arabic language are never used in respect of the animal although it
	also hears-and sees. Thus, hearing and seeing here do not imply the
	powers of hearing and seeing which have been given to the animals
	too, but those means through which man obtains knowledge and then
	draws conclusions from it. Besides, since hearing and seeing are
	among the most important means of knowledge for man, only these two
	have been mentioned briefly; otherwise it actually implies giving
	man all those senses of the body by which he gathers information.
	Then the senses given to man are quite different in their nature
	from those given to animals, for at the back of every sense he has a
	thinking brain, which collects information gained through the
	senses; arranges it, draws conclusions from it, forms opinions, and
	then takes some decisions which become the basis of his attitude and
	conduct in life. Hence, after saying, &quot;We created man in order
	to try him,&quot; to say, &quot;therefore, We made him capable of
	hearing and seeing&brvbar; actually contains the meaning that Allah
	save him the faculties of knowledge and reason to enable him to take
	the test. Obviously, if this were not the meaning and the meaning of
	making man hearing and seeing just implied the one who could hear
	and see, then a blind and deaf person would stand exempted from the
	test, whereas unless a person is utterly devoid of knowledge and
	reason, there can be no question of his being exempted from the
	test.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote5">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>That
	is, &quot;We did not just leave him to himself after giving him the
	powers of knowledge and reason, but We also guided him so that he
	knows which is the path of gratefulness and which of ungratefulness,
	so that whichever path he chooses in his later life, he himself is
	responsible for it. In Surah Al-Balad, the same subject has been
	expressed, thus &quot;And We showed him both the conspicuous ways
	(of good and evil).&quot; And in Surah Ash-Shams, thus &quot;By the
	human self, and by Him Who balanced it (with all the external and
	internal powers), then inspired it with its wickedness and its piety
	&quot; When all these explanations are kept in view and also those
	detailed statements of the Qur'an in which it has been stated what
	arrangements Allah has made for man's guidance in the world, it
	becomes evident that in this verse &quot;showing the way&quot; does
	not imply any one form of guidance but many forms of it which arc
	limitless and countless. For example. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) Along
	with the faculties of knowledge and reason man has also been endowed
	with a moral sense by which he discerns between good and evil,
	regards some acts and qualities as evil even if he himself is
	involved in them, and regards some other acts and qualities as good
	even if he himself is avoiding them. So much so that even those
	people who for the satisfaction of their selfish motives and desires
	have invented philosophies by which they have justified many evils
	for themselves, protest loudly when they are themselves treated with
	the same evils by others, and then it becomes known that in spite of
	their false philosophies they actually regard them as evil.
	Likewise, when a man himself is benefited by a good treatment from
	another person, he is from within forced to commend and appreciate
	it even though he might be looking upon good acts and qualities as
	ignorance folly and antiquated things, 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) In
	every man Allah has placed the faculty of Conscience (the lawwamah),
	which checks and pricks him every time he is about to commit an
	evil, or is in the process of committing it, or has already
	committed it. However hard man may try to silence his Conscience or
	make it insensitive, he does not have the power to destroy it
	completely. He may become shameless and prove himself to be
	absolutely devoid of the Conscience, he may also try to deceive the
	world by argumentation, he may even invent a thousand excuses to
	justify his acts in order to deceive himself, but despite all this
	the censor that Allah has placed in his nature is so active and
	powerful that it does not let remain hidden from an evil person what
	he actually is. This same thing has been stated in Surah Al-Qiyamah,
	thus: &quot;Man knows his own self best even though he may offer
	many excuses.&quot; (v. 15) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) In
	man's own self and outside him, from the earth to the heavens, there
	lie scattered in the universe countless such signs which clearly
	show that all this could not happen without a God, nor could there
	be many gods to create this life and control and administer it.
	Likewise, these very signs, inside man and outside him, clearly
	point also to the Resurrection and Hereafter. If man shuts down his
	eyes on them, or refuses to ponder over them intelligently, or
	avoids to admit the truths which they point out, he himself would be
	to blame. For Allah has shown no negligence in laying out every
	possible sign of the truth for the guidance of man. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) Man
	does come across in his own life, and in the contemporary world and
	in the experiences of past history, countless such incidents which
	prove that a supreme power is ruling over him and the entire
	universe before whom he is absolutely powerless, whose Will is
	dominant over everything and whose help he needs at every moment.
	These experiences and observations which point to the truth do not
	exist only outside him but in man's own nature as well there exists
	the evidence of the existence of the supreme power on the basis of
	which even the most confirmed atheist spreads out his hands in
	prayer before God when in distress and the most hardened polytheist
	abandons all false gods and starts invoking One God only for help. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) Man's
	intellect and his nature assert positively that crime ought to be
	punished and good deeds ought to be rewarded. On this very basis in
	every society of the world a system of the courts is established in
	one form or another, and the services and works, which are regarded
	as commendable are also rewarded in one way or another. This is a
	clear proof of the fact that there is a necessary relationship
	between morality and the law of retribution, which man cannot
	possibly deny. Now, if it is admitted that in this world there are
	countless such crimes which cannot be punished at all. to say
	nothing of punishing them fully and adequately, and there are also
	countless such virtues, which cannot be rewarded at all, to say
	nothing of rewarding them fully and adequately, there is no
	alternative but to acknowledge the Hereafter, unless, of course, a
	foolish person may assume, or a stubborn person may insist on having
	the opinion, that man who has been endowed with the concept of
	justice, has taken birth in a world which in itself is devoid of the
	concept of justice; and then it remains for him to answer the
	question as to how and where from this man, who was born in such a
	world, obtained this concept of justice. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">To
	reinforce these means of guidance Allah sent Messengers and revealed
	Books in the world for the purpose of giving clear and definite
	guidance to man; in these Books it was clearly explained what is the
	way of gratefulness and what is the way of ungratefulness and
	unbelief and what will be the consequences of following either way.
	The teaching brought by the Prophets and the Books has spread
	throughout the world in countless perceptible. and imperceptible
	ways, on such a large scale that no section of human population has
	remained unaware of the concept of God and the Hereafter, of the
	distinction between good and evil, and of the moral principles and
	legal rulings presented by them, whether it knows or does not know
	that it has obtained this knowledge only through the teachings of
	the Prophets and the Books they brought. Even those who disbelieve
	in the Prophets and the Books today, or are unaware of them, also
	are following many of those things which have reached them actually
	through their teachings while they do not know what is the real

	meaning of fulfilling the vow is that one should fulfill, second,
	that one should fulfill what one has pledged oneself to do, third,
	that one should fulfill what one has been enjoined; what is
	obligatory for one to do, whether one has been enjoined it, or is
	self-imposed. Of these three the second meaning is the best known
	and generally the same is implied by fulfilling the vow. In any
	case, these righteous people have been regarded as praiseworthy
	either because they carry out the duties enjoined by Allah, or
	because if they vow to Allah to perform certain good deeds which
	Allah has not enjoined on them, they fulfill even those self imposed
	vows, not to speak of showing any negligence,in carrying out the
	duties which Allah has actually enjoined on them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the commandments concerning the vow, we have explained these briefly
	in E.N. 310 of Surah Al-Baqarah above, But it would be useful to
	explain them at length here so as to enable the people to avoid the
	errors and rid themselves of the misunderstandings with regard to
	fulfilling the vow and learn the correct rules pertaining to it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	jurists have mentioned four kinds of the vow: (a) that one should
	pledge to Allah that one would perform such and such a good act to
	earn His good pleasure; (b) that one should make a vow that one
	would perform such and such a good act in gratitude to Allah if He
	fulfilled one's such and such wish and desire. Both these kinds of
	the vow have been termed nadhr tabarrur (i.e. vows for a good cause)
	by the jurists, and it is agreed by all that it is obligatory to
	fulfill them. (c) That one should pledge to do an unlawful thing or
	to refrain from an obligatory thing; (d) that one should bind
	oneself to do a permissible thing, or to refrain from an obligatory
	thing, or pledge to do an unworthy thing. These two kinds of the vow
	have been termed nadhr lajaj (i.e. vow of ignorance, disputation and
	stubbornness) by the jurists. About the third kind of the vow it is
	agreed that it does not take place at all; and about the fourth kind
	the juristic opinion is divided. Some jurists say that it should be
	fulfilled; some others say that one should expiate the breaking of
	the oath, and still others that one has the option to fulfil the vow
	or to expiate it. According to the Shaf is and the Malikis this vow
	does not take place at all, and according w the Hanafis both these
	kinds of the vow entail expiation. (`Umdat al-Qari)

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Several Ahadith show that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has
	forbidden making a vow with a view to changing the destiny, or with
	a view to making an offer to Allah that if He fulfilled one's such
	and such wish, one would perform such and such good act, not in
	gratitude to Allah, but in exchange for His ,help. Hadrat `Abdullah
	bin `Umar has reported that once the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) while he forbade the making of a vow, said; &quot;It cannot
	avert anything which is about to befall, but through it something is
	extracted from the miserly person.&quot; (Muslim, Abu Da'ud), The
	last sentence of the Hadith means: The miserly person is not prone
	to spend anything in the cause of Allah; because of the vow he gives
	away something in charity in the greed that Allah would accept his
	offer and change his destiny for him. Another tradition from Hadrat
	`Abdullah bin 'Umar is to the effect; &quot;The Holy Prophet said:
	the vow can neither hasten anything nor defer anything, but through
	it something is extracted from the miserly person. &quot; (Bukhari,
	Muslim). In another tradition he says that the Holy Prophet forbade
	making of the vow and said: &quot;It does not bring any good, but it
	is a means whereby something is extracted from the miserly person.&quot;
	(Bukhari, Muslim). Several traditions on the same subject have been
	related by Muslim from Hadrat Abu Hurairah, and in one tradition
	which both Bukhari and Muslim have related, he reports that the Holy
	Prophet said: &quot;As a matter of fact, the vow cannot bring the
	son of Adam anything which Allah has not ordained for him, but the
	vow sometimes coincides with the destiny itself and through it the
	Divine will takes out from the possession of the miserly person that
	which he was not inclined to give away willingly.&quot; This same
	theme is further explained by the tradition of Hadrat `Abdullah bin
	`Amr bin `As according to which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) said: &quot;True vow is that whereby Allah's goodwill and
	approval may be sought. &quot; ( Tahavi) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
	Another rule that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) gave
	concerning the vow is that only that vow should be fulfilled, which
	is in obedience to Allah; the vow made in disobedience to Allah
	should never be fulfilled. Likewise, there can be no vow concerning
	a thing which is not in one's power to perform. Hadrat `A'ishah has
	reported that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;The one who made a vow
	that he would obey Allah, should obey Him, and the one who made a
	vow that he would disobey Allah, should not disobey.&quot; (Bukhari,
	Abu Da ud Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, lbn Majah, Tahavi). Thabit bin Dahhak
	says that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: &quot;There
	can be no question of fulfilling a vow made in the disobedience of
	Allah, nor in something which is not in one's possession.&quot; (Abu
	Da'ud). Muslim has related a tradition on the same subject from
	Hadrat `Imran bin Husain; and in Abu Da'ud a tradition has been
	reported in greater detail from Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr bin `As,
	saying that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;No vow and no oath is of
	any use in an act which is not in the power of man to perform, or
	which involves disobedience of Allah, or severance of relations with
	kindred.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) One
	should not fulfill a vow which is made to perform an act which is of
	no good in itself, which is useless, or involves unbearable hardship
	or self-torture, and might have been self-imposed as an act of
	virtue. In this connection, the sayings of the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be peace) are very clear and definite. Hadrat `Abdullah bin
	`Abbas says that once when the Holy Prophet was giving a sermon, he
	saw a man who was standing in the sun. He asked who he was and why
	he was standing in the sun. The people said that he was Abu Isra'il:
	he had vowed that he would keep standing and would not sit, nor take
	shade, nor speak to anybody, and would keep fast. Thereupon the Holy
	Prophet said: &quot;Tell him to speak, to come in the shade and sit,
	but to observe the fast.&quot; (Bukhari, Abu Da'ud, Ibn Majah,
	Mu'watta). Hadrat `Uqbah bin `Amir Juhani says: &quot;My sister
	vowed that she would go for Hajj bare-foot and also vowed that she
	would not cover her head with a garment during the journey. The Holy
	Prophet said: Tell her to go by a conveyance and to cover 'her
	head.&quot; (Abu Da'ud). Muslim has related several traditions on
	this subject with a little variation in wording. Hadrat `Abdullah
	bin `Abbas reporting the incident concerning `Uqbah bin `Amir's
	sister, has reported the Holy Prophet's words to the effect: &quot;Allah
	has no need of her vow: tell her to use a conveyance.&quot; (Abu
	Da'ud). In another tradition Hadrat Ibn `Abbas says &quot;A man
	said: My sister has vowed to go and perform Hajj on foot. The Holy
	Prophet replied: Allah has no need that your sister should undergo
	hardship. She should go for Hajj by a conveyance.&quot; (Abu Da'ud).
	Hadrat Anas bin Malik has reported that the Holy Prophet saw
	(probably during the Hajj journey) an old man being supported
	between his two sons. When he asked what was the matter with him, it
	was said that the old man had vowed to go on foot. Thereupon the
	Holy Prophet said: &quot;Allah is free from this that the man should
	place himself in agony. Then he commanded him to ride.&quot;
	(Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud. In Muslim another Hadith on this very
	subject has been reported by Hadrat Abu Hurairah also). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) If it
	is not practically possible to fulfill a vow, it may be fulfilled in
	some other way. Hadrat Jabir bin `Abdullah says: &quot;On the day of
	the conquest of Makkah, a man stood up and said: O Messenger of
	Allah, I had vowed that if Allah made Makkah fall at your hand, I
	would pray two rak ahs of the Prayer in Bait al-Maqdis (Jerusalem).
	The Holy Prophet replied: Say the Prayer here. He again asked the
	same thing and the Holy Prophet again gave the same reply. When he
	asked it again, the Holy Prophet said: All right, as you please.&quot;
	According to another tradition, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;By Him
	Who has sent Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)
	with the truth, if you pray here it will suffice for you instead of
	your praying at Bait al Maqdis (Abu Da'ud).&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) The
	opinion among the jurists is divided concerning the person who vows
	to give away all his possessions for the cause of Allah. Imam Malik
	says that he should give away one-third of his possessions, and
	Sahnun from among the Malikis has expressed the opinion that he
	should give away so much of his possessions as does not subject him
	to hardship later. Imam Shafe`i says that if the vow is of the
	nature of tabarrur(i.e. for a good cause), he should give away all
	his possessions, and if it is of the nature of lajaj (i.e, a vow of
	ignorance), he has the option to fulfill the vow or to expiate the
	oath. Imam Abu Hanifah says that he should give away all such
	possessions as are subject to zalrat, but the vow will not apply to
	those possessions which are exempt from zakat, e.g. house, or other
	such properties. Imam Zufar from among the Hanafis is of the opinion
	that he should give away everything in charity after he has taken
	out two months' maintenance for his family. ( `Umdat al-Qari, Sharh
	Mu'watta by Shah Waliyullah). Traditions of the Hadrat in this
	connection are as follows. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Ka'b bin Malik says: &quot;When I was granted forgiveness for
	incurring Allah's displeasure for staying behind on the occasion of
	the Battle of Tabuk, I went before the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) and submitted: My repentance also included that I would give
	away all my possessions in charity for the sake of Allah and His
	Messenger. The Holy Prophet replied: No, do not do that. I said.
	Then half of the possessions? He said: No. I said: Then one-third of
	the possessions? He replied: Yes.&quot; (Abu Da'ud). According to
	another tradition, the Holy Prophet replied: &quot;Withhold some of
	your possessions for yourself: this would be better for you.&quot;
	(Bukhari), Imam Zuhri says: &quot;Information has reached me that
	Hadrat Abu Lubabah (who had similarly incurred displeasure in
	connection with the same Battle of Tabuk) said to the Holy Prophet:
	&quot;I shall give away all my possessions for the sake of Allah and
	His Messenger in charity. The Holy Prophet replied: For you it would
	be enough to give away only one-third of it.&quot; (Mu'watta). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7)
	Should a person who vowed to perform a good act before embracing
	Islam, fulfil it after he has embraced Islam? The Holy Prophet's
	ruling in this connection is that he should fulfil it. (Bukhari;
	according to a tradition in Abu Da ud and Tahavi Hadrat `Umar is
	reported to have vowed in the pre-Islamic days that he would observe
	i `tikaf(devotional seclusion) in the Masjid al-Haram (for one
	night, or according to others, one day). After embracing Islam when
	he asked for the Holy Prophet's ruling, he replied: &quot;Fulfill
	your vow.&quot; Some jurists have taken this ruling of the Holy
	Prophet to mean that it is obligatory to do so, and some others that
	it is commendable. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(8) About
	the question whether the heirs are under obligation to fulfill a vow
	made by the deceased person or not, the juristic opinion is divided.
	Imam Ahmad, Ishaq bin Rahawaih, Abu Thaur and the Zahiris say that
	if the deceased person had vowed to observe the Fast or perform the
	Prayer but could not fulfill the vow, the heirs have to fulfill it.
	The Hanafis say that if the vow pertained to a bodily worship (e.g.
	the Prayer or the Fast), the heirs are under no obligation to
	fulfill it, and if it pertained to monetary worship and the deceased
	did not leave any will for his heirs to fulfill it, they are again
	under no obligation to fulfill it. but if he left a will, it will be
	obligatory for the heirs to fulfill it from his inheritance up to
	one-third of its extent. The Maliki viewpoint also is somewhat the
	same. The Shafe`is say that if the vow pertains to a non-monetary
	worship, or if it pertains to a monetary worship and the deceased
	person did not leave any inheritance, the heirs are under no
	obligation to fulfill it; and if the deceased left some inheritance,
	the heirs would be bound to fulfill the vow pertaining to a monetary
	worship, no matter whether the dying person left a will or not.
	(Sharh Muslim by AI-Nawawi, Badhl al-Majhud Sharh Abi Da ud). In the
	Hadith there is a tradition from Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas on this
	subject to the effect: &quot;Hadrat Sa`d bin `Ubadah asked for the
	Holy Prophet's verdict, saying: My mother has died and she had made
	a vow which she could not fulfill. The Holy Prophet said: Fulfill
	the vow on her behalf.&quot; (Abu Da'ud. Muslim). Another tradition
	from Ibn `Abbas is to the effect: &quot;A woman went on a sea
	journey and vowed that if she returned home safe and sound, she
	would observe fast for a month. On her return home she died. Her
	sister or her daughter came to the Holy Prophet to ask for his
	decision. The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;Observe the fast on her
	behalf.&quot; (Abu Da'ud Abu Da'ud has related another tradition
	with the same content from Hadrat Buraidah, saying: &quot;A woman
	asked the Holy Prophet a similar thing and he gave the same reply as
	mentioned above.&quot; Since these traditions are not explicit as to
	whether the rulings the Holy Prophet gave pertained to its being
	obligatory or commendable, and since about the vow made by Hadrat
	Sa`d bin `Ubadah's mother also it is not clear whether it pertained
	to a monetary worship, or a bodily worship, there have arisen
	differences among the jurists on this question. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(9) As
	for an unlawful vow it is clear that it should not be fulfilled.
	However, there is a difference of opinion as to whether it entails
	an expiation or not. On this point since the traditions differ the
	juristic opinion is also divided. According to one kind of the
	traditions the Holy Prophet commanded the person concerned to make
	the expiation. Hadrat `A'ishah has reported that the Holy Prophet
	said: &quot;Three is no vow in the disobedience of Allah, and its
	expiation is the expiation of breaking the oath&quot; (Abu Da'ud, In
	the case of `Uqbah bin `Amir Juhani's sister (mentioned under No. 4
	above), the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) commanded that she
	should break her vow and fast for three days. (Muslim, Abu Da'ud).
	In the case of another woman also who had vowed to go for Hajj on
	foot, he commanded that she should go by a conveyance and should
	make expiation for the oath (Abu Da'ud). Ibn `Abbas has reported
	that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;The one who made a vow but did not
	specify what the vow was about, should expiate for the oath, and the
	one who made a vow to perform a sinful act, should expiate for the
	oath, and the one who made a vow to perform something which he does
	not have the power to perform, should expiate for the oath, and the
	one who made a vow to do something which he can do, should fulfill
	it.&quot; (Abu Da'ud). On the other hand, there are the traditions
	which show that there is no expiation in this case. The person under
	No.4 above had vowed that he would stand in the sun and would not
	speak to anyone. Making a reference to him in Mu'watta, Imam Malik
	writes: &quot;I could not know by any means whether the Holy Prophet
	besides commanding him to break the vow might also have told him to
	make the expiation. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr bin `As has reported
	that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;If the one swearing an oath for
	something later finds that another thing was better than that he
	should abandon it and should adopt the better course and the
	abandonment itself is the expiation.&quot; (Abu Da'ud; Baihaqi says
	that this Hadith and Hadrat Abu Hurairah's this tradition: &quot;He
	should adopt the better course and this is its expiation&quot; are
	not established). Imam Nawawi discussing these traditions of the
	Hadid in his commentary of Sahih Muslim writes: &quot;Imam Malik,
	Shafe`i, Abu Hanifah, Da'ud Zahiri and other scholars say that the
	vow made to do a sinful thing is void and ineffectual and it does
	not entail any expiation if not fulfilled, but Imam Ahmad says that
	it entails expiation.&quot;&nbsp;

	adding ginger-mixed water to it: it will be a natural fountain which
	will have the flavor of ginger but without its bitterness;
	Therefore, it will be called Salsabil, which implies such water as
	flows gently and pleasantly down the throat on account of its being
	sweet, light and palatable. Most commentators think that the word
	salsabil has been used here as an adjective of the fountain and not
	as a name for it.&nbsp;</P>

	rule followed in the Qur'an is that wherever the Muslims have been

	after it they have been commanded to remember Allah much and to
	observe the Prayer, which automatically implies that the power

	of truth faith can be obtained only by this means. To remember Allah
	morning and evening may also imply remembering Allah always but when
	the command to remember Allah at specific times is given, it implies
	the salat (Prayer). In this verse, bukrah means the morning and asil
	the time from the sun's decline till sunset, which obviously covers
	the Zuhr and the Asr times. Night starts after sunset;. therefore,
	the command &quot;to prostrate yourself in the night&quot; would
	apply to both the Maghrib and the `Isha' Prayers. Then, the command
	&quot;to glorify Allah in the long hours of night&quot;, clearly
	points to the time of the Tahajjud Prayer. (For further explanation,
	see E.N.'s 92 to 97 of Bani Isra'il, E N. 2 of AI-Muzzammil). This
	also shows that these very have been the Prayer times in Islam from
	the beginning. However, the command making the Prayer obligatory
	five times a day with fixed tunes and number of rakahs was given on
	the occasion of mi`raj (ascension).&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote33sym" HREF="#sdfootnote33anc">33</A>Three
	things have been said in these verses:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	whoever wills may adopt the way to his Lord;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	one's willing to do a thing is not enough unless Allah so wills; and</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) that
	Allah is All-Wise, All-Knowing. If one considers these three things
	deeply one can fully well understand the relationship between man's
	freedom of choice and Allah's Will, and it helps to remove all the
	confusions from the people's minds about the question of destiny. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The first
	verse shows that in this world the authority granted to man is only
	to the extent that he may decide to adopt any one of the different
	courses available for passing life here. This is the freedom of
	choice that Allah has given him. For example, when a man confronts
	the question of earning a living for himself, he finds many ways
	before him of which some are lawful, as for example lawful kinds of
	labor, service, trade and business, industry, or agriculture, and
	some are unlawful as thievery, robbery, picking pockets,
	prostitution, trading in money (on interest), gambling, bribery and
	unlawful kinds of services and business, etc. The decision to adopt
	any one of these ways has been left to man's own free choice as to
	how he would like to earn his living. Likewise, there are different
	modes of morality. On the one side, there are the good qualities,
	like honesty, nobility, decency, justice, pity, sympathy and
	chastity, and on the other, the evil traits like wickedness,
	meanness, tyranny, dishonesty, and frivolity. Man has full freedom
	to adopt any mode of morality he likes. The same is the case with
	religion; man has many ways open before him in this regard
	also-atheism and denial of God, polytheism and idol-worship,
	different combinations of monotheism and polytheism, and the
	un-alloyed creed of God-worship which is taught by the Qur'an. In
	these also the decision to choose has been left to man as to which
	of these he wants to adopt. Allah does not impose on him any
	decision of His own so that man may like to choose a lawful means of
	earning his living for himself but Allah may force him to adopt an
	unlawful means for it. or that he may like to follow the Qur'an, but
	Allah may force him to become an atheist, polytheist or disbeliever,
	or that he may like to become a good man, but Allah may force him to
	become an evil man. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But after
	man has exercised this freedom of choice whether he can practically
	also do the same which he wants to do, depends on Allah's Will, His
	leave and His grace. If the Will of Allah be to let the man do what
	he has willed or decided to do, then alone can he do it; otherwise
	he cannot do anything without Allah's Will and His leave, however
	hard and seriously he may try to do it. This same thing has been
	said in the second verse. This can be explained by an example. If
	man had been delegated all the powers in the world and permitted to
	do whatever he pleased, the system of the world would have been
	disrupted. One murderer was enough to murder all the, people in the
	world if he were given the freedom to kill anybody he liked. One
	pickpocket could pick the pocket of everyone if he were given the
	option to pick anyone's pocket he pleased. One thief was enough to
	steal whatever he liked; one adulterer to commit rape on every
	woman, one robber to plunder every house, if each one of these had
	full powers to act at he desired. Therefore, Allah has kept this in
	His own power whether He may allow or disallow the man to follow the
	right or the wrong path that he chooses to follow or not. The person
	who, giving up error, wants to adopt the right way is also granted
	righteousness only by Allah's leave and will. However, the condition
	is that the decision to give up error and choose guidance should
	have been taken by the man himself; otherwise just as Allah does not
	make anybody a thief or murderer or atheist or polytheist forcibly,
	so also He does not make anybody a believer forcibly. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After
	this, the third verse removes the misunderstanding whether Allah's
	willing may not be arbitrary. That is why it has been said that
	&quot;Allah is All-Knowing, Al-Wise.&quot; That is whatever He does,
	He does it on the basis of knowledge and wisdom; therefore, there
	can be no possibility of any error in His decisions. He decided with
	full knowledge and wisdom as to who should be given a particular
	kind of help and who should not be given it, who should be allowed
	to do a particular work and who should not be allowed to do it. To
	the extent that Allah provides opportunities to man and makes the
	conditions favorable for him, he can work according to his desire,
	whether it be good or evil, The question of guidance also is no
	exception to it. Allah alone knows on the basis of His knowledge and
	He alone determines on the basis of His wisdom as to who deserves to
	be guided and who does not. (Also see E.N. 41 of Al-Muddaththir&nbsp;

	this verse &quot;wrong doers&quot; imply the people whom the
	Revelations of Allah and the teachings of His Prophet may reach, yet
	they deliberately and consciously decide that they would not obey
	and follow them. This also includes those unjust people who may
	plainly say that they do not accept the Revelation as God's
	Revelation and the Prophet as God's Prophet, or that they do not
	believe in God at all, and also those wicked people who may not
	refuse to believe in God and the Prophet and the Qur'an, but they
	are resolved not to obey and follow them. As a matter of fact, both
	these groups are unjust and wicked. As regards the first group,
	their case is clear and obvious; but the second group is no less
	wicked: it is also hypocritical and treacherous. Verbally they say
	that they believe in God and the Messenger and the Qur'an, but in
	their hearts and minds they are resolved not to follow them, and
	their practical conduct of life is also opposed to it. About both
	Allah has declared that He has prepared for them a painful torment.
