opinion there is an internal piece of evidence in the Surah itself
which points to its being a Madani Revelation. It holds out a threat
of destruction to those praying ones who are unmindful of their
Prayers and who pray only to be seen. This kind of hypocrites were
found only at Madinah, for it was there that Islam and the Muslims
gained such strength that many people were compelled to believe from
expedience, had to visit the Mosque, join the congregational Prayer
and prayed only to be seen of others, so as to be counted among
Muslims. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Contrary
to this is, at Makkah conditions were altogether different. No one
had to pray to be seen. There it was difficult even for the believers
to pray in congregation; they prayed secretly and if a person prayed
openly he did so only at the risk of his life. This kind of
hypocrites found in Makkah did not comprise those who believed and
Prayed to be seen but those who in their hearts had know, and
acknowledged the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom be peace) to be
on the true path, but were avoiding to accept Islam in order to
maintain their Position of leadership and authority, or were not
prepared to take the risk of being afflicted with the kind of
hardships with which they found the believers afflicted in the
society around them. This condition of the hypocrites at Makkah has
been described in vv. 10-11 of Surah Al- Ankabut. (For explanation,
see E.N.'s 13 to 16 of Surah Al-'Ankabut). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

in the last four verses the state of those hypocrites who apparently
are Muslims but have no idea of the Hereafter, its judgment, and the
meting out of rewards and punishments accordingly has been described.
On the whole, the object of depicting the attitude and conduct of two
kinds of people is to impress the point that man cannot develop a
strong, stable and pure character in himself unless he believes in
the Hereafter. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	has been described in the succeeding verses can be seen by every
	seer with his eyes, as well as knowing, understanding and
	considering something deeply. If the word ara'aita is taken in the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">For
	example, if in his own house there is a closely related orphan, it
	is the orphans lot to serve the whole house, to receive rebuffs and
	suffer humiliation for trivial things. Besides, this sentence also
	contains the meaning that - the person does not behave unjustly and
	tyrannically only occasionally put this is his habit and settled
	practice. He does not have the feeling that it is an evil which he
	must give up, but he persists in it with full satisfaction, thinking
	that the orphan is a helpless, powerless creature; therefore, there
	is no harm if his rights are taken away wrongfully, or he is made
	the target of tyranny and injustice, or he is repulsed and driven
	away whenever he asks for help. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, Qadi Abul Hasan al-Mawardi has related a strange
	incident in his Alam an-Nubuwwat. Abu Jahl was the testator of an
	orphan. The child one. day came to him in the condition that he had
	no shred of a garment on his body and he implored him to be .given
	something out of his father's heritage. But the cruel man paid no
	attention to him and the poor child had to go back disappointed. The
	Quraish chiefs said to him out of fun: &quot;Go to Muhammad (upon
	whom be Allah's peace and blessings) and put your complaint before
	him. He will recommend your case before Abu Jahl and get you your
	property.&quot; The child not knowing any background of the nature
	of relationship between Abu Jahl and the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) and not understanding the motive of the mischief-mongers,
	went straight to the Holy Prophet and apprised him of his
	misfortune. The Holy Prophet immediately arose and accompanied the
	child to the house of Abu Jahl, his bitterest enemy. Abu Jahl
	received him well and when the latter told him to restore to the
	child his right, he yielded and brought out whatever he owed to him.
	The Quraish chiefs were watching all this earnestly m the hope that
	an interesting altercation would take place between them. But when
	they saw what actually happened they were astounded and went to Abu
	Jahl and taunted him saying that he too perhaps had abandoned his
	religion. He said: &quot;By God, I have not abandoned my religion,
	but I so felt that on the right and left of Muhammad (upon whom be
	Allah's peace and blessings) there was a spear which would enter my
	-body if I acted against what he desired. &quot; This incident not
	only shows what was the attitude and conduct of the principal chiefs
	of the most civilized and noble tribe of Arabia towards the orphans
	and other helpless people in those days but it also shows what
	sublime character the Holy Prophet possessed and what impact it had
	even on his bitterest enemies. A similar incident we have already
	related in E.N. 5 of Surah Al-Anbiya' above, which points to the
	great moral superiority of the Holy Prophet because of which the
	disbelieving Quraish branded him as a sorcerer.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote6sym" HREF="#sdfootnote6anc">6</A>La
	yahuddu means that the person neither persuades his own self, nor
	tells the people of his household, to provide the poor man with his
	food, nor does he urge others to recognize the rights of the poor

	satisfy their hunger. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, by
	giving only two conspicuous examples, Allah has pointed out what
	kind of evils are produced in the people who deny the Hereafter: The
	real object is not to point out only these two evils-that the people
	drive away the orphans and do not urge giving away the food of the
	poor as a result of the denial of the Hereafter. But of the
	countless evils which are thus produced, two evils have been
	presented as an example, which every noble and sound-natured person
	will regard as hateful. Besides, another thing meant to be impressed
	is that if this very man had believed at he would have to go before
	God to render an account of his deeds, he would not have committed
	such evils as to deprive the orphan of his rights, tyrannize him,
	repulse him, neither feed the poor man himself nor urge others to
	give him his food. The characteristics of the believers in the
	Hereafter which have been described in Surah Al-`Asr and Surah
	Al-Balad are that they exhort one another to mercy, and they exhort
	one another to the truth and to render the rights of others.&nbsp;

	words used are an-salat-i him sahun and not fi salat-i-him lahum. In
	case the words fi salat-i him had been used, the meaning would be
	that they forget in the course of their Prayer.' But forgetting in
	the course of the Prayer is no sin in the eyes of the Shari `ah,
	nothing to say of its being hypocrisy, nor is it a fault or anything
	blameworthy. The Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) himself sometimes
	forgot in the Prayer and to compensate for it he prescribed the
	method of sajdah sahv. On the contrary, `an salat-i-him sahum means
	that they are neglectful of their Prayer. Whether they perform the
	Prayer, or do not perform it, it is of little importance to them.
	They are not regular at the Prayers. When they perform it, they do
	not observe the prescribed times, but offer it carelessly at the
	eleventh hour. Or, when they rise up for the Prayer, they rise up
	soullessly and perform it with an unwilling heart, as if it were a
	calamity imposed on them. They play with their garments, yawn and
	betray absence of every trace of Allah's remembrance in their
	hearts. Throughout the Prayer they show no feeling at all that they
	are performing the Prayer, nor of what they are reciting; their
	minds wander and they perform articles of the Prayer without due
	attention; they somehow perform a semblance of the Prayer and try to
	be rid of it as soon as ,possible. And there are many people who
	would perform the Prayer only when they must, otherwise the Prayer
	has no place in their lives. The Prayer time comes but they show no
	concern that it is the Prayer time; they hear the call to the Prayer
	but do not understand what the caller is calling to, whom he is
	calling and for what purpose. These in fact are the signs of absence
	of faith in the Hereafter. The claimants to Islam believe thus only
	because they do not believe that they would be rewarded for
	performing the Prayer, nor have the faith that they would be
	punished for not performing it. On this very basis, Hadrat Anas bin
	Malik and `Ata bin Dinar say: &quot;Thanks to God that he said 'an
	salat-i-him and not fi salat-i -him. That is, we do forget in the
	course of the Prayer but we are not forgetful and neglectful of it;
	therefore, we shall not be counted among the hypocrites.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Qur'an at another place has described this state of the hypocrites,
	thus: &quot;They come to offer their Prayer but reluctantly, and
	they expend in the way of Allah with unwilling hearts.&quot;
	(At-Taubah: 54). The Holy Messenger of Allah has said: &quot;This is
	the Prayer of the hypocrite; this is the Prayer of the hypocrite;
	this is the Prayer of the hypocrite ! He watches the sun at the `Asr
	time until when it reaches between the two horns of Satan (i.e. when
	the time of sunset 'approaches), he gets up and performs the Prayer
	carelessly, in which he remembers Allah but little.&quot; (Bukhari,
	Muslim, Musnad Ahmad) Mus'ab bin Sa`d has related from his father,
	Hadrat Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas: &quot;When I asked the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) about the people who are neglectful of their
	Prayer, he said: &quot;These are the people who perform their
	Prayers when the prescribed time for it has passed.&quot; (Ibn
	Jarir, Abu Ya'la, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn abI Hatim, Tabarani in Ausat;
	Ibn Marduyah, Baihaqi in As-Sunan. This tradition has been related
	as a statement of Hadrat Sa`d himself also as a mauquf hadith and
	its sanad is stronger. Its being a marfu' narration of the saying of
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). has been regarded as weak by
	Baihaqi and Hakim). Another tradition from Hadrat Mus'ab is that he
	asked his father: &quot;Have you considered this verse? Does it mean
	giving up the Prayer, or wandering of one's attention in the course
	of the Prayer?-Who among us has not his attention divided? He
	replied: No, it implies wasting the prescribed time of the Prayer
	and performing it when its time has elapsed.&quot; (Ibn Jarir, Ibn
	Abi Shaibah, Abu Ya`la, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Marduyah, Baihaqi in
	As-Sunan):</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, one
	should understand that coming of other thoughts in the mind in the
	course of the. Prayer is one thing and bing unmindful of the Prayer
	and thinking other things during it quite another. The first state
	is a natural human weakness. Other thoughts do interfere without
	intention, and as soon as a believer feels that his attention is
	wandering from the Prayer. he gathers it and brings it back to the
	Prayer. The other state is of being neglectful of the Prayer, for in
	it man only goes through an exercise of the Prayer mechanically, he
	has no intention of the remembrance of God in his heart. From the
	commencement of the Prayer till its completion his heart is not
	turned towards God even for a moment, and he remains engrossed in
	the thoughts with which he entered the Prayer.&nbsp;

	can be an independent sentence as well as one relating to the
	preceding sentence. In the first case, it would mean that they do
	not perform any act of goodness with a pure intention for the sake
	of God, but whatever they do , they do to be seen of others so that
	they are praised, are considered righteous, their good act is
	publicized and its advantage and benefit accrues to them here in the
	world. In the second case, the meaning would be that they pray to be
	seen. The commentators generally have preferred the second meaning,
	for at first sight it appears that it relates to the preceding
	sentence. Ibn `Abbas says: &quot;It implies the hypocrites who
	prayed to be seen. They performed the Prayer if there was somebody
	to see them, but did not perform it if there was nobody to see
	them.&quot; In another tradition his words are to the effect: &quot;If
	they were alone they did not pray; but if there were others, they
	prayed. &quot;. (Ibn Jarir, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Abi Hatim , Ibn
	Marduyah, Baihaqi , in Ash-Shu ab). In the Qur'an too the hypocrites
	have been described thus: &quot;When they rise up for the salat,
	they go reluctantly to it, merely to be seen of people and they
	remember Allah but little.&quot; (An-Nisa': 142).&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote11sym" HREF="#sdfootnote11anc">11</A>The
	word used is ma'un. The view held by Hadrat `Ali, Ibn `Umar, Sa`id
	bin Jubair, Qatadah, Hasan Basri, Muhammad bin Hanafiyyah, Dahhak,
	Ibn Zaid, `Ikrimah, Mujahid, `Ata' and Zuhri (may Allah show them
	mercy) is that it implies the zakat while Ibn `Abbas, Ibn Mas`ud,
	Ibrahim Nakha`i, Abu Malik and many other scholars have expressed
	the opinion that it implies items of common use; for example,
	cooking-pot, bucket, hatchet, balance, salt, water, fire, flint (now
	its successor, the match-stick), etc. which the people generally
	borrow from each other. A statement of Sa'id bin Jubair and Mujahid
	also supports it. Another view of Hadrat 'Ali also is that it
	implies the zakat as well as the little courtesies and kindnesses of
	daily Iife. Ibn Abi Hatim has related from `Ikrimah that ma'un of
	the highest form is zakat and of the lowest lending of a sieve,
	bucket, or needle to a barrrower. Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas`ud says:
	&quot;We, the Companions of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace),
	used to say (and according to other traditions, in the time of the
	Holy Prophet, used to say) that ma'un implies lending of the cooking
	pot, hatchet. bucket, balance, and such other things.&quot; (Ibn
	Jarir. Ibn Abi Shaibah, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Bazzar, Ibn al-Mundhir,
	Ibn Abi Hatim, Tabarani in AI-Ausat, Ibn Marduyah, Baihaqi in
	As-Sunan). Sa`d bin 'Iyad without specifying any names has related
	almost the same view from the Companions of the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be peace), which shows that he had heard this from several
	Companions. (Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Shaibah). Dailami, Ibn `Asakir, and
	Abu Nu`aim have related a tradition from Hadrat Abu Hurairah in
	which he says that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) himself
	explained this verse saying that it implies the hatchet, bucket and
	other such things. If this tradition is genuine it probably did not
	come to the notice of other scholars; otherwise it was not possible
	that other people should have given any other commentary of this
	verse. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Ma`un in
	fact is a small, little thing useful to the people. Accordingly,
	zakat also is ma'un, for it is a little amount out of much wealth,
	which one has to give away in order to help the poor, and the other
	small items of common use also are ma'un as mentioned by Hadrat
	`Abdullah.Ibn Mas`ud and the scholars who share his viewpoint. The
	majority of the commentators say that ma `un applies to all those
	small things which the neighbors usually ask each other for, and
	asking for these is not in any way blameworthy, for the rich and the
	poor, all stand in need of these at one time or another. However, to
	show stinginess in lending these is regarded as mean behavior
	morally. Generally these things by themselves last and the neighbor
	returns them in the original form after he has used them. It would
	also be maim if a neighbor asks the other for a bed or bedding items
	on the arrival of guests, or asks the neighbor's permission to have
	loaves baked in his, oven, or wants to leave some valuables in the
	neighbor's custody when going out of his house for some days. Thus,
	the verse means to impress that denial of the Hereafter renders a
	man so narrow-minded and niggardly that he is not even prepared to
	make a most minor sacrifice for the sake of others.
