<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
already mentioned in the introduction to Surah An Naml, according to
Ibn Abbas and Jabir bin Zaid, Surahs Ash-Shu`araa', An-Naml and Al-
Qasas were sent down one after the other. The language, the style and
the theme also show that the period of the revelation of these three
Surahs is nearly the same. Another reason for their lose resemblance
is that the different parts of the Prophet Moses story as mentioned
in these surahs together make up a complete story. In Surah Ash
Shu`araa', excusing himself for not accepting the office of
Prophethood the Prophet Moses submits, &quot;The people of Pharaoh
have the charge of a crime against me; therefore, I fear that they
will put me to death.&quot; Then, when lie goes before Pharaoh, the
latter says, &quot;Did we not bring you up as a child in our house?
You lived quite a few years of your life among us, and then you did
what you did.&quot; Nothing more of this has been mentioned there,
but in this Surah the other details have been supplied. Similarly, in
Surah An-Naml the story starts abruptly from the time when the
Prophet Moses was journeying with his family and suddenly saw a fire
at a distance. In that Surah nothing has been said about the nature
of his journey, or the place he was coming from, or his destination,
but this Surah supplies all the necessary details. Thus, the three
Surahs read together complete the story of the Prophet Moses (Allah's
peace be upon him). </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<H2 STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Theme
and Topics</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
main theme is to remove the doubts and objections that were being
raised against the Prophethood of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon
whom be Allah's peace and blessings) and to invalidate the excuses
which were being offered for not believing in him. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For
this purpose, first the story of the Prophet Moses has been related,
which, by analogy with the period of revelation, impresses the
following points in the listeners mind automatically: </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First,
Allah provides the means and motives of whatever He wills to do, in
imperceptible ways. Thus, Allah so arranged things that the child
through whom Pharaoh had to be removed from power, was bred and
brought up in his own house, and he could not know whom he was
fostering. Who can then fight God and frustrate Him by his
machinations. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Secondly,
Prophethood is not granted to a person amid festivities by issuing a
proclamation from the earth and heavens. You wonder how Muhammad
(upon whom be Allah's peace) has been blessed with Prophethood
unexpectedly, all of a sudden, but Moses whom you yourselves
acknowledge as a Prophet (v. 48) had also become a Prophet
unexpectedly, while on a journey, and nobody had known what event had
occurred in the desolation at the foot of Mt. Sinai. Even Moses
himself did not know a moment before what he was going to be blessed
with. He, in fact, had gone to bring a piece of the fire but had
returned with the gift of Prophethood. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thirdly,
the person from whom Allah wants to take some service comes out
without any army and armor and without an apparent helper or force at
his back, yet he puts to rout much stronger and better equipped
opponents. The contrast that existed between the strengths of Moses
(peace be upon him) and Pharaoh was much more prominent and glaring
than that which existed between Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the
quraish; yet the world knows who had come out victorious in the end
and who had been routed. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fourthly,
you refer to Moses again and again and say, &quot;Why has Muhammad
not been given the same which was given to Moses? i. e. miracles of
the staff, the shining hand, etc. as if to suggest that you would
readily believe only if you were shown the kind of the miracles that
were shown by Moses to Pharaoh. But do you know what sort of response
was made by those who were shown those miracles? They had not
believed even after seeing the miracles, and had only said, &quot;This
is magic&quot;, for they were involved in stubbornness and hostility
to the Truth. The same malady afflicts you today. Will you believe
only when you are slowly the same kind of miracles?Then, do you know
what fate the disbelievers had met even after seeing the miracles?
They were annihilated by Allah. Do you now wish to meet the same doom
by asking for the miracles in your obstinacy? </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These
were the things which were automatically impressed in the mind of
every listener who heard this story in the pagan environment of
Makkah, for a similar conflict was going on at that time between the
Holy Prophet and disbelievers of Makkah as had already taken place
between the Prophet Moses and Pharaoh before. This was the background
against which the story of the Prophet Moses was narrated so that a
perfect analogy was established automatically in every detail between
the conditions prevailing then in Makkah and those existing in the
time of the Prophet Moses. Then, from verse 43 onward the discourse
turns to the real theme. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the first place, the narration of a two thousand year old historical
event by the Holy Prophet with such accuracy and detail, is presented
as a proof of his Prophethood although he was un-lettered and the
people of his city and clan knew full well that he had no access to
any source of such information as they could point out. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
the disbelievers of Makkah have been warned and put to shame for an
event that occurred in those very days. Some Christians had come to
Makkah and embraced Islam when they heard the Qur'an from the Holy
Prophet. Instead of learning any lesson from this the Makkans were so
upset at this that their leader, Abu Jahl, disgraced those people
publicly. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">In
conclusion, the excuse that the disbelievers put forward for not
believing in the Holy Prophet has been dealt with. What they feared
was this:&quot;If we give up the polytheistic creed of the Arabs and
accept the doctrine of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Tauhid</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">instead, this will put an end to our
supremacy in the religious, political and economic fields, which, in
turn, will destroy our position of the most influential tribe of
Arabia and we shall be left with no refuge anywhere in the land.&quot;
As this was the real motive of the chiefs of the Quraish for their
antagonism towards the Truth, and their doubts and objections were
only the pretenses, which they invented to deceive the common people,
Allah has dealt with these fully till the end of the Surah,
considered each aspect of these in a wise manner and offered the
remedy for their basic ailment due to which those people judged the
Truth and falsehood only from the viewpoint of their worldly
interests. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

On the other hand, the heart of Moses' mother was sorely distressed.
She would have disclosed his secret, had We not strengthened her
heart so that she might have faith (in Our promise). She said to his
sister, &quot;Follow him up.&quot; So, she watched him from a
distance in a manner that (the enemies) did not notice it.&rdquo;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote13anc" HREF="#sdfootnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A>

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Now
	there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. And he
	said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel
	are more and mightier than we: Come on, let us deal wisely with
	them: lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there
	falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight
	against us, and so get them up out of the land. Therefore they did
	set over them task masters to afflict them with their burdens. And
	they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Ra`amses ....And
	the Egyptians trade the children of Israel to serve with rigour; And
	they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in
	brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service,
	wherein they made them serve, was with rigour .... And the king of
	Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives .... And he said, When ye do the
	office of a midwife to Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools;
	if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter,
	then she shall live.&quot; (Exod. 1: 8-16). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	shows that after the passing away of the Prophet Joseph a
	nationalist revolution took place in Egypt, and when the Copts
	regained power the new nationalist government employed every means
	to subdue the Israelites. They did not _ only humiliate and disgrace
	them and took mean services from them, but, over and above this,
	they adopted the policy of reducing their population, by killing
	their sons and allowing their daughters to live so that their women
	should gradually pass into the Copts' hands and produce the Coptic
	instead of the Israelite race. The Talmud adds that this revolution
	had taken place a little over a hundred years after the death of the
	Prophet Joseph. According to it, the new government, in the first
	instance, deprived the Israelites of their fertile lands and houses
	and possessions, and then removed them from the government jobs and
	offices. Even after this whenever the Coptic rulers felt that the
	Israelites and their Egyptian coreligionists were becoming
	formidable they would disgrace them and employ them in rigorous jobs
	on little or no wages at all. This is the explanation of the
	Qur'anic verse: &quot;He debased a section of the Egyptian
	population&quot;, and of verse 49 of Al Baqarah: &quot;They had
	inflicted a dreadful torment on you. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">However,
	neither the Bible nor the Qur'an mentions that the Pharaoh was told
	by an astrologer that a boy would be born among the Israelites, who
	would become a cause of his deposition from power and to meet this
	danger he had issued orders to kill the male children born in the
	Israelite homes, or that Pharaoh himself had seen a dreadful dream
	and the explanation given was that a son would be born among the
	Israelites, who would cause his downfall. Our commentators have
	taken this &brvbar;`legend from the Talmud and other Israelite
	traditions. (See Jewish Encyclopedia, under ;&quot;Moses&quot;, and

	through some means, or through some wretched informer from among the
	Israelites themselves, she should place the child in a box and cast

	the Prophet Moses' mother kept him hidden for three months after his
	birth. The Talmud adds that the Pharaoh's government had appointed
	Egyptian women who carried infants into the Israelite homes, and
	would make these babies cry, so as to make any hidden Israelite
	infants also cry and be thus discovered. This new method of spying
	worried Moses' mother and in order to save her child's life, she

	According to these, the Prophet Moses' mother made a basket of reeds
	and covered it with slime (tar) and with pitch to make it
	watertight. Then she laid the child in it and placed it in the river

	found no mention anywhere in the Israelite traditions, that is, that
	the Prophet Moses' mother had done all this according to an

	were situated, the servants of Pharaoh picked it up and took it
	before the king and the queen. It is just possible that the king and
	the queen were at that time strolling along the river bank and might
	have noticed the basket and ordered it to be picked up. When they
	saw a child in it, they could easily guess that it belonged to an
	Israelite family. For it came from the quarters inhabited by the
	Israelites, whose sons were being put to death in those days. It was
	understood that somebody had hidden the child for some time but when
	it could not be hidden any longer, it was cast to the river in the
	hope that it might be picked up and rescued from death. With this in
	view the most obedient servants. submitted that the king order the
	child to be killed forthwith, for it might prove dangerous for him.
	But the Pharaoh's wife was a woman and might even be childless. Then
	it was a lovely child, as Allah has reminded Moses in Ta Ha: 39,
	thus: &quot;I had cast on you love from Myself.&quot; That is &quot;I
	had made you such a lovely child that the beholders could not help
	regarding you with love.&quot; Therefore, the woman could not help
	feeling for him, and said to the king, &quot;Do not kill him, but
	let us adopt him. When he grows up in our house as our son, he will
	not know that he was an Israelite: he will rather think he is one of
	Pharaoh's own kinsfolk, and he will be useful for us as against the

	was the same kind of mentality as the Russian communists of today
	are displaying. They launch Sputniks and Lunics and tell the world
	that these balls have not found God anywhere above. That stupid man
	of yore wanted to see God from the top of a tower. This shows that
	the extent of the imagination of the straying people during the past
	3,500 years has remained where it was. They have not advanced even
	an inch. It is not known who told them that the Being Whom the
	God-worshipers acknowledge as the Lord of the universe resided some
	where above according to their belief. And if they do not see Him a
	few thousand feet or a few lakh miles above the earth's surface in
	this limitless universe, it will be a proof that He exists nowhere. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Qur'an does not specify whether Pharaoh actually got such a tower
	built and tried to see God from the top of it, but it only relates
	what he said. Apparently, he did not commit the folly. He only meant
	to befool the people. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This also
	is not clear whether Pharaoh was, in actual fact, a disbeliever in
	the Being of the Lord of the universe, or talked atheism only due to
	stubbornness. In this regard his sayings point to the same mental
	confusion which one finds in the statements of the Russian
	Communists. Sometimes he wanted to climb into the sky and come back
	to tell the world that he had nowhere seen the God of Moses, and
	sometimes he would say, &quot;Why were not bracelets of gold sent
	down on him, or a company of angels as attendants?&quot;
	(Az-Zukhruf: 53) These things are not much different from what a
	former Prime Minister of Russia, Khrushchev, said. He sometimes
	rejected God and sometimes invoked Him and swore by Him. We are of
	the opinion that after the passage of the period of the Prophet
	Joseph and his successors when Egypt was dominated by the Coptic
	nationalism and a political revolution took place in the country
	owing to the racial and nationalistic prejudice, the new leaders, in
	their nationalistic enthusiasm, revolted against the God also
	towards Whom the Prophet Joseph and his followers, the Israelites
	and the Egyptian Muslims, had been calling the people. They thought
	that if they believed in God, they would never be able to shed the
	influence and impact of the civilization brought about by the
	Prophet Joseph. For if that civilization remained, they would never
	be able to consolidate, their political influence. For them belief
	in God and Muslim sovereignty were inseparable and inter-dependent.
	Therefore, to get rid of the one it was necessary to reject the
	other, although they could not root out belief in One God from the
	depths of their hearts. &nbsp;

	things have been presented as a proof of the Holy Prophet's
	Prophethood. At the time when these were cued all the chiefs of
	Makkah and the common disbelievers were bent upon somehow proving
	him as a non-prophet, and, God forbid, a false claimant to
	Prophethood. To help and assist them in their campaign there were
	the Jewish scholars and the Christian monks also, who were living in
	the habitations of the Hijaz. Besides, the Holy Prophet Muhammad
	(may Allah's peace be upon him) had not appeared all of a sudden
	from somewhere and started reciting the Qur'an to the people, but he
	was a resident of the same city of Makkah, and no aspect of his life
	was hidden from the people of his city and clan. That is why when
	these three things were presented like an open challenge as a proof
	of his Prophethood, not a single person from Makkah and Hijaz and
	the entire land of Arabia could stand up to say the absurd thing
	which the modern orientalists say, although those people were no
	less . efficient in fabricating falsehood than these so-called
	scholars. But how could they utter an unprofitable lie that could
	not survive for a single moment? How could they say, &quot;O
	Muhammad, you have attained this information from such and such a
	Jewish scholar and a Christian monk?&quot; For, this purpose, they
	could not mention any name in the entire land. For whatever name
	they mentioned, it would become manifest there and then that the
	Holy Prophet had not obtained any information from him. How could
	they say, &quot;O Muhammad, you possess a full-fledged library
	containing all sorts of books an ancient history and sciences and
	literature, from which you take help to prepare all your
	discourses?&quot;' For not to speak of a library, no one could seize
	even a scrap of paper from his house containing such information.
	Everyone in Makkah knew that Muhammad (may Allah's peace be upon
	him) was un-lettered and no one could also say that he had had some
	translators at his disposal, who supplied him with translations from
	Hebrew and Assyrian and Greek books. Then, none of them could be so
	shameless as to dare claim that he had obtained this information
	during the trade journeys to Syria and Palestine, for he had not
	performed those journeys alone, but had traveled in company with
	trade caravans of Makkah. Had somebody made any such assertion,
	hundreds of living witnesses would have refuted this and testified
	that he had received no such instruction from anyone there. Then,
	within two years of the Holy Prophet's death war had started between
	the Romans and the Muslims. If he had any son of discussion anywhere
	in Syria and Palestine with any Christian monk or Jewish rabbi, the
	Roman Empire would not have hesitated to launch a propaganda
	campaign, saying, that Muhammad (peace be upon him), God forbid, had
	learned everything from them and gone back to Makkah and proclaimed
	himself a Prophet. In short, at that time when the challenge of the
	Qur'an was the knell of the disbelieving Quraish and the polytheists
	and the need of those people to refute it was far greater then of
	the modern orientalists, no one could discover any material by which
	he could prove that the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
	peace) had some other means than Revelation for obtaining that
	information .</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One
	should also know that the Qur'an has not given this challenge only
	here, but at several other places also in connection with different
	stories. After narrating the story of the Prophet Zacharias and
	Mary, it was said: &quot;These are of the 'unseen' things We are
	revealing to you: you were not present there when the priests of the
	Temple were casting lots by throwing their quills to decide which of
	them should be the guardian of Mary: nor were you there with them
	when they were arguing about it.&quot; (Al-i-`Imran: 44) At the end
	of the Prophet Joseph's story it was said: &quot;This story which We
	are revealing to you is of those things that were not known to you:
	for you were not with the brothers (of Joseph), when they had
	conspired together a plot against Joseph.&quot; (Yusuf: 102)
	Similarly, after relating the full story of the Prophet Noah, it was
	said: &quot;These are some of the tidings of the `unseen' which We
	are revealing to you. You did not know these before nor did your
	people.&quot; (Hud: 49) That this thing has been reiterated several
	times shows that this was one of the main arguments that the Qur'an
	gave to prove its being Allah's Word and the Holy Prophet's being a
	Messenger of Allah. For there was no perceptible means of knowledge
	available to the Holy Prophet who was an unlettered person, apart
	from Revelation, through which he could narrate so accurately the
	events that had happened hundreds and thousands of years in the
	past. And this was one of the important reasons why the
	contemporaries of the Holy prophet were coming to believe, in larger
	and still larger numbers, that he was really a Prophet of Allah and
	received Allah's Revelations. Now one can easily imagine how
	important it must have been for the opponents of the Islamic
	movement at that time to meet this challenge, and what efforts they
	must have made to collect arguments and proofs against it. One can
	also see that if, God forbid, there was the slightest weakness. in
	this challenge, it would not have been at all difficult for the
	contemporary people to provide evidence for its refutation. &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This

	when the news about the Holy Prophet's advent and message spread in
	that land, a deputation of about twenty Christians came to Makkah to
	find out the truth, and they met the Holy Prophet in the
	Masjid-al-Haram A crowd of the Quraish also gathered around them to
	watch what happened. The members of the deputation asked the Holy
	Prophet some questions, which he answered. Then he invited them to
	accept Islam and recited some verses of the Qur'an before them. When
	they heard the Qur'an, tears came down from their eyes and they
	confirmed its being Allah's Word and believed in the Holy Prophet.
	When the meeting was over and the people left, Abu Jahl and some of
	his men overtook them on the way, and rebuked them severely, saying,
	&quot;Never has a more stupid company come here before: O foolish
	men you were sent here by your people with a view to inquiring about
	this man. but no sooner did you meet him than you gave up your own
	faith! &quot; Those gentle people answered, &quot;Peace be to you!
	We have no wish to enter all argument with you: you are responsible
	for your faith and we are for ours: we cannot afford to deprive
	ourselves knowingly of goodness.&quot; (Ibn Hisham, Vol. II, p. 32;

	is, &quot;Even before this we were believers in the Prophets and the

	have believed in that Book too, which this Prophet has brought from
	Allah. Thus, no change has occurred in our religion: we were Muslims
	before even as we are Muslims now.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	saying clearly indicates that Islam is not the name of the Faith
	brought by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the
	term &quot;Muslim&quot; is not only applicable to his. followers,
	but Islam has been the Faith of all the Prophets since the very
	beginning and their followers were Muslims in every age. These
	Muslims became disbelievers only when they refused to acknowledge a
	true Prophet who came afterwards. But no interruption occurred in
	the Islam of those people who believed in the former Prophet and
	also affirmed faith in the Prophet who succeeded him. They continued
	to be Muslims as they had been Muslims before. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is
	strange that even some learned men also have failed to comprehend
	this fact, and this clear verse also could not satisfy them. `Allama
	Suyuti wrote a treatise on the subject that the term &quot;Muslim&quot;
	was only reserved for the followers of the Holy Prophet Muhammad
	(may Allah's peace be upon him). Then, as he himself says, when this
	verse came before him he was stunned: he prayed to God that He guide
	him in the matter. At last, instead of revising his opinion he stuck
	to it even more firmly and gave several interpretations of the
	verse, each to which is more meaningless than the other. For
	example, one of his interpretations is: &quot;We were Muslims even
	before this&quot; means: We intended to become Muslims even before
	the revelation of the Qur'an, because we had been foretold by our
	Scriptures that it would come, and we hadthe intention that when it
	came we would accept Islam.&quot; Another interpretation is: &quot;In
	this sentence, the word bi-hi after muslimin is omitted, implying:
	We believed in the Qur'an beforehand, because we expected it would
	come, and had believed in it in anticipation. Therefore, we were
	Muslims, not because we believed in the Torah and the Gospels, but
	because we had believed in the Qur'an as Allah's Word even before
	its revelation.&quot; The third interpretation is: &quot;It had been
	divinely destined for us that we would accept Islam on the advent of
	the Holy Prophet and the revelation of the Qur'an; therefore, we
	were Muslims even before this.&quot; None of these interpretations
	bears any impress that Divine help had become available for the
	right understanding of this verse. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The fact
	is that the Qur'an has expressed this fundamental principle not only
	here, but at scores of other places also that the real Way of life
	is only Islam (submission to Allah), and in God's universe there can
	be no other way of life than this for His creatures. Since the
	beginning of the creation every Prophet who came for the guidance of
	mankind brought this very Way of Life: the Prophets themselves have
	always been Muslims, and they impressed upon their followers also to
	live as Muslims, and all their followers who submitted to the Divine
	Command brought by the Prophets, were also Muslims in every age.

	the meaning in which they are used in Arabic. In fact, what has been
	stressed in the above-cited verses is that the real Way of life sent
	by God was neither Christianity nor Mosaicism nor Muhammadanism, but
	to surrender to the Divine Commands taught by the Prophets and the
	Scriptures, and whoever adopted this Way anywhere and at any time in
	the world, is the follower of the same universal, eternal and
	everlasting true Way of Life. For those who have adopted this Way
	consciously and sincerely, it is no change of the faith to believe
	in Jesus after Moses and in Muhammad after Jesus(may Allah's peace
	be upon all of them), but a natural and logical demand following the
	same real Way of life (Islam). Contrary to this, those people who
	got into the Prophets' communities without due understanding or were
	born in them, and for whom nationalistic and racial and tribal
	prejudices were the religion, became mere Jews or Christians, and on
	the advent of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) their
	ignorance was exposed. For by refusing to believe in the Last
	Prophet of Allah, they not only refused to ,remain Muslims in the
	future but also proved that they were not &quot;Muslims&quot; even
	before: they had been charmed by the personality of a Prophet or

	are! People from far off places are coming to benefit from the
	fountainhead of blessings that has been made available in your own

	should benefit from this life-giving nectar, but your willing alone

	your kinsfolk lack this inclination, how can they be favored with
	this blessing?&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to Bukhari and Muslim. this verse was sent down with regard to the
	Holy Prophet's uncle, Abu Talib. When he was about to breathe his
	last, the Holy Prophet tried his utmost that he should affirm faith
	in La ilaha illallah, so that he might die as a Muslim, but he
	preferred to die on the creed of `Abdul Muttalib; that is why Allah
	said: &quot;You cannot give guidance to whom you please..&quot; But
	this is a well-known method of the traditionalists and commentators
	that when they find that a particular verse applies to an event of
	the Prophet's time, they regard it as the occasion of the verse's
	revelation. Therefore, it cannot be necessarily concluded from this
	and the other similar traditions that have been related in Tirmidhi,
	Musnad Ahmad, etc. on the authority of Hadrat Abu Hurairah, Ibn
	`Abbas, Ibn `Umar, etc. that this verse of Surah Al-Qasas was
	revealed on the occasion of Abu Talib's death. This only shows that
	the truth of its meaning became most evident only on that occasion.
	Though the Holy Prophet sincerely wished that every man should be
	blessed with guidance, the person whose dying on disbelief could
	cause him the greatest anguish and of whose guidance he was most
	desirous on account of personal bonds of love and affection, was Abu
	Talib. But when he was helpless in affording guidance even to him,
	it became evident that it did not lie in the power of the Prophet to
	give guidance to one or withhold it from another, but it lay wholly
	in the power of Allah. And Allah bestows this favor on whom ever He
	wills not on account of a family or tribal relationship, but on the
	basis of one's sincerity, capability and inclination of the heart.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote80">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote80sym" HREF="#sdfootnote80anc">80</A>This
	was the most important excuse which the unbelieving Quraish made for
	not accepting Islam. To understand fully we shall have to see what
	was the position of the Quraish historically which they feared would
	be affected if they accepted Islam. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	importance that the Quraish gained initially in Arabia was due to
	them being genealogically the descendants of the Prophet Ishmael,
	and therefore, the Arabs looked upon them as the children of the
	Prophets. Then, when they became the custodians of the Ka`bah
	through Qusayy bin Kilab's sagacity, and Makkah became their home,
	their importance grew, because they were the attendants of the most,
	sacred shrine of Arabia, and its priests too. Therefore, every Arab
	tribe had to have relations with them on account of the annual
	pilgrimage. Taking advantage of this central position the Quraish
	started gaining prominence as a commercial people, and to their
	great good fortune, the political conflict between the Eastern Roman
	Empire and Iran helped them to gain an important place in the
	international trade. Iran in those days had blocked entrance to all
	the trade routes between Rome, Greece, Egypt and Syria in the north
	and China, India, Indonesia and eastern Africa in the south-east.
	The only exception was the Red Sea route. This also was blocked when
	Yemen fell to Iran. After this no way of the transit of trade goods
	remained except that the Arab merchants should transport merchandise
	of the Roman territories to the harbors of the Arabian Sea and the
	Persian Gulf, and then lift trade goods of the eastern countries
	from these harbors and transport them to the Roman territories This
	sort of arrangement made Makkah an important center of the
	international trade, and the Quraish were its monopolists. But the
	chaotic conditions prevailing in Arabia did not allow smooth transit
	of the trade goods unless the Quraish had had pleasant relations
	with the tribes through whose territories the trade caravans passed.
	For this the religious influence of the Quraish was not enough; they
	had had to enter into treaties with the tribes concerned, pay them
	dividends from their profits, and make gifts to the tribal chiefs
	and other influential people. Besides, they traded in money-lending
	also on a vast scale, which had ensnared the merchants and the
	chiefs of almost all the neighboring tribes. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Such were
	the conditions when the Holy Prophet gave his message of Tauhid.
	More than the prejudice of ancestral religion what caused the
	Quraish the greatest provocation against it was that in it they saw
	their own interests in jeopardy. They thought that even if
	polytheism and idol-worship were proved wrong and . Tauhid right by
	rational arguments and reasoning, it was ruinous for them to accept
	Tauhid. For as soon as they did so the whole of Arabia would rise in
	revolt against them. Then, they would be ousted from the
	custodianship of the Ka'bah, and all their bonds and pacts of
	friendship with the polytheistic tribes would be severed, which
	alone guaranteed the safe transit of their trade caravans through
	their territories. Thus, the new Faith would not only put an end to
	their religious influence but also to their economic prosperity, and
	they might even be forced by the Arabs to quit Makkah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	presents a strange phenomenon of the lack of insight on the part of
	the world-worshipers. The Holy Prophet tried his best to make them
	believe that if they accepted his Message, the whole world would
	yield and submit to them. (See also Introduction to Surah Sad). But
	they saw their death in it. They thought that the change of the
	Faith would not only deprive them of their wealth and prosperity and
	influence but would render them so completely helpless in the land
	that the birds of the sky would pick and eat their flesh. They could
	not foresee the time when a few years afterwards the whole of Arabia
	was going to be ruled by' a central government under the Holy
	Prophet himself. Then even during the lifetime of their own
	generation Iran and `Iraq and Syria and Egypt were going to fall,
	one after the other, to the same central authority and within a
	century of this utterance by them Caliphs from the clan of the
	Quraish itself were to rule over vast territories, from Sind to
	Spain and from Caucasus to the coasts of Yemen.

<DIV ID="sdfootnote84">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote84sym" HREF="#sdfootnote84anc">84</A>This
	is the fourth answer to their excuse. To understand it fully one
	should bear in mind two things: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	the present life which is no more than a few years for anyone, is
	only the temporary phase of a journey. The real life which will be
	everlasting is yet to come. In this life man may amass as much
	provision as he may please and live the few years at his disposal as
	comfortably as he can, it will in any case come to an end, and man
	will depart from the world empty-handed. No sensible person will
	like to make the bad bargain of suffering the everlasting distress
	and affliction in the Hereafter in exchange for the pleasures and
	comforts of his brief sojourn in the world. As against this, he
	would rather prefer to face a few years of hardships here and earn
	the goodness that may earn him everlasting bliss and comfort in the
	eternal life of the Next World. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	Allah's religion does not demand that man should totally refrain
	from seeking and enjoying the good things of life and discard its
	adornments in any case. Its only demand is that he should prefer the
	Hereafter to the world, for the world is perishable and the
	Hereafter everlasting; and the pleasures of the world are inferior
	and of the Hereafter superior. Therefore, man must try to attain
	those provisions and adornments of the world that may enable him to
	fare well in the everlasting life of the Next World, or at least
	protect him from the eternal loss there. But in case there is a
	question of a comparison between the two, and the success of the
	world and of the Hereafter oppose and contradict each other, the
	Faith demands, and this is the demand of man's good sense too, that
	he should sacrifice the world to the Hereafter, and should never
	adopt the way of only seeking the transitory provisions and
	adornments of this world, which inevitably lead to his ruin in the
	Hereafter forever. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Keeping
	these two things in view let us see what Allah says to the
	disbelievers of Makkah in the foregoing sentences. He does not tell
	them to wind up their business, stop their trade and follow His
	Prophets and become mendicants. What He says is that the worldly
	wealth of which they are so enamored, is very meager and they can
	utilize it only for a few days in this worldly life. Contrary to
	this, that which is with Allah is much better both in quality and in
	quantity and is also everlasting. Therefore, they would be foolish
	if for the sake of benefiting by the limited blessings of this
	transitory life, they adopted the way whose evil results they will
	have to suffer in the form of everlasting loss in the Next World.
	They should judge for themselves as to who is successful: He who
	exerts himself in the service of his Lord and then is blessed with
	His favors for ever, or he who will be produced as a culprit in His
	Court, only after having had an opportunity of enjoying unlawful
	wealth for a few days in the world.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote85">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote85sym" HREF="#sdfootnote85anc">85</A>This
	discourse is in continuation of the fourth answer, and is linked
	with the last sentence of the preceding verse. It means to imply
	this: Those who persist in the evil of shirk and idol-worship and
	refuse to believe in the Prophet only for the sake of their worldly
	interests, will meet with such and such evil consequences in the
	eternal life of the Hereafter. They should, therefore, carefully
	judge for themselves whether it would be a good bargain if they were
	to be doomed to such an end, after they had enjoyed fully the
	provisions and adornments of the short worldly life even if no
	calamity befell them in the world.&nbsp;

	implies those satans from among jinns and men, who had been set up
	as associates, of God in the world, whose teachings had been
	followed in preference to Divine Commandments, and dependence on
	whom had made the people give up the Right Way and adopt the wrong
	ways of life. Such persons may not have been called gods and lords
	as such, but since they were worshiped and obeyed as one should
	worship and obey only God, they were inevitably made partners in
	Godhead.&nbsp; 
	</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote87">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote87sym" HREF="#sdfootnote87anc">87</A>That
	is, &quot;We did not lead them astray forcibly. We neither deprived
	them of their powers of seeing and hearing nor of their powers of
	thinking, nor there ever arose a situation when they wanted to
	follow the right way but we might have forcibly pulled them to the
	wrong way. But just as we ourselves had gone astray of our own free
	will, so they also of their own free will accepted the wrong way
	when we presented it before them. Therefore, we are not responsible

	responsible for theirs.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is
	a subtle point to be noted here. Allah, in fact, will question those
	who had set up others as associates with Him, but before they make
	an answer, those who had been set up as associates will speak up.
	The reason is: When the common polytheists will be questioned thus,
	their leaders and guides will feel that their doomsday had come, for
	their followers will certainly blame them for their deviation.
	Therefore, even before the followers say something in response, the
	leaders will forestall them and start pleading their innocence.</P>

	return ultimately. Its use as a common noun implies that it is a

	Paradise. Let it remain indefinite as Allah Himself has put it so

	World. The context also requires that it should be looked upon as a
	promise to bestow the highest glory and eminence on the Holy Prophet
	ultimately not only in the Hereafter but in this world too. In the
	saying of the disbelievers of Makkah, which has been the theme of
	the discourse from verse 57 until now, they had said, &quot;O
	Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him), do you want us also to be
	doomed with you ? If we join you and adopt this Faith, it will
	become hard for us to live in Arabia.&quot; In response to this,
	Allah tells His Prophet: &quot;O Muhammad, that God Who has placed
	the burden of conveying the message of the Qur'an on you, will not
	destroy you: rather He will exalt you to the rank which these people
	cannot even imagine today.&quot; And, in actual fact, in a few years
	after this, even in this world, Allah granted the Holy Prophet
	complete authority over the whole of Arabia, and there was no power
	to resist him, and no religion to stand its ground. There had been
	no precedent in the history of Arabia that the whole peninsula might
	have come under the sway of one man so completely that no opponent
	might be there to challenge him and no soul to dare disobey his
	orders. Then it was not only a political domination but religious
	too, for the whole population had been won over to Islam.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	commentators opine that this verse of Surah Al-Qasas was sent down
	on the way during the Holy Prophet's migration from Makkah to
	Madinah, and in this Allah had promised His Prophet that He would
	again bring him back to Makkah. But, firstly, the words of the verse
	do not allow that &quot;ma `ad&quot; be taken to mean &quot;Makkah&quot;.
	Secondly, this Surah, both according to the traditions and the
	internal evidence of its theme, was revealed some time during the
	time of the migration to Habash, and one cannot understand that if
	this verse was revealed after several years on the way during the
	migration to Madinah. why was it inserted in this context without
	any relevance? Thirdly, in this context, the mention of the Holy
	Prophet's return to Makkah seems quite irrelevant. For if the verse
	is taken to mean this, it will not be a reply to the disbelievers'
	excuse but would rather strengthen it. It would mean this: &quot;No
	doubt, what you say, O people of Makkah, is correct. Muhammad will
	be expelled from this city, but he will not remain an exile for
	ever, but eventually We will bring him back to this very place.&quot;
	Though this tradition has been reported by Bukhari, Nasa'i, Ibn
	Jarir and other traditionalists on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, it
	is, in fact, Ibn `Abbas's own opinion; it is not a tradition that
	might have been received direct from the Holy Prophet that one may

<DIV ID="sdfootnote109">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote109sym" HREF="#sdfootnote109anc">109</A>This
	thing is being presented as a proof of the Holy Prophet Muhammad's
	Prophethood. Just as the Prophet Moses was wholly unaware that he
	was going to be appointed a Prophet, and sent on a grand
	mission-when he had never even expected or wished for such a thing,
	but had been suddenly called upon while on a journey and made a
	Prophet and assigned a mission which had no relevance with his
	previous life-so was precisely the case with the Holy Prophet
	Muhammad (may Allah's peace be upon him). The people of Makkah knew
	full well what kind of life he was leading till a day before the day
	when he came down from the Cave of Hira' with the message of
	Prophethood. They were fully aware of his occupations, of the topics
	of his conversation, of the nature of his interests and activities.
	No doubt it was a life which was an embodiment of truth, honesty and
	righteousness, a model of nobility, peacefulness, fulfillment of
	obligations and rights of others and of the service to humanity, but
	there was nothing in it which could give somebody any idea that the
	righteous man was going to make a claim to Prophethood the next day.
	There was no one among his most intimate friends and relations and
	neighbors, who could say that he had already been preparing to
	become a Prophet. No one had ever heard a word on the themes and
	problems and topics from him, which became the subject of his daily
	conversation all of a sudden after the revolutionary moment in the
	Cave of Hira'. No one had heard him employing the kind of diction
	and words and terms, which the people started hearing from him in
	the shape of the Qur'an. He had never stood up for preaching, had
	never given a message or started a movement, and none of his
	activities had ever indicated that he was anxious to undertake a
	program for the solution of the social problems or for religious or
	moral reformation. Till a day before this revolutionary moment he
	was leading the life of a trader, who earns his living by fair and
	lawful means. who lives a happy life with his family, receives his
	guests, helps the poor and treats his relatives well, and at times
	retires from society into seclusion for the sake of worship. For
	such a person it would be a great change if he started making, all
	of a sudden, world-moving orations, preaching a revolutionary
	message, producing a sublime literature and propounding an enduring
	philosophy of life and a profound system of thought and morality and
	social life. For psychologically too, such a change is not possible
	through any kind of preparation and conscious effort. Any such
	effort and preparation, in any case, has to pass through certain
	evolutionary stages, which cannot remain hidden from the people
	among whom a person is passing his life. Had the Holy Prophet's life
	passed through any such stages of gradual development, hundreds of
	the people in Makkah would have come out to say, &quot;Did we not
	tell you beforehand that this man would one day make a tall claim?&quot;
	But history bears evidence that no one in Makkah ever made such an
	objection although the disbelievers of Makkah raised all sorts of
	other objections against the Holy Prophet. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then
	another thing: the Holy Prophet himself never wished for or expected
	or awaited his appointment to prophethood, but he came across this
	experience all of a sudden quite unexpectedly. This is supported by
	the event that has been reported in the Traditions in connection
	with the beginning of Revelation. After his first meeting with the
	Angel Gabriel and the revelation of the initial verses of Surah
	Al-`Alaq he rushes back home from Hira' trembling with fear, and
	says to his wife, &quot;Cover me with a cloak! Cover me with a
	cloak!&quot; After a while when he recovers a little from the state
	of anxiety, he relates what he had experienced to his wife and says,
	&quot;I feel there is danger to my life!&quot; She responds, &quot;No,
	never! Allah will never bring you to grief: you render the rights of
	your kindred, you support the indigent, help the poor, treat your
	guests well, and are ever ready to contribute to a good cause.&quot;Then
	she takes him to Waraqa bin Naufal, who was her cousin and a
	righteous and knowledgeable person from among the people of the
	Book. Hearing from him what had happened, Waraqa says without any
	hesitation, &quot;The one who came to you is the same Namus (the
	specially appointed Divine Messenger), who used to come to Moses. I
	wish I were a young man and could live till the time when your
	people will expel you.&quot; The Holy Prophet asks, &quot;Will my
	people expel me?&quot; He replies, &quot;Yes; no one has passed
	before, who brought same thing that you have brought, and his people
	did not turn hostile to him. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	whole event depicts the state which a simple man will naturally
	undergo when he is confronted unexpectedly by a most extraordinary
	experience all of a sudden. If the Holy Prophet had already been
	anxious to become a prophet and thinking that a man like him ought
	to be a prophet, and had been meditating and straining his mind and
	awaiting the arrival of an angel with a message, he would have been
	filled with delight at the experience in the Cave, and descending
	from the mountain would have gone straight before his people and
	proclaimed Prophethood. But, quite to the contrary, he is confounded
	at what he had seen, reaches home trembling and lies in bed fully
	covered up. When he is composed a little, he tells his wife quietly
	what had happened in the solitude of the Cave, and expresses
	feelings of anxiety and insecurity. How different is this state from
	the state of a candidate for prophethood ! 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then ,
	who can be better aware of the husband's life, his ambitions and
	thoughts, than the wife? If she had perceived before-hand that the
	husband was a candidate for prophethood and had been anxiously
	awaiting the arrival of the angel, her reply would have been
	different from what Hadrat Khadijah said. She would have answered,
	&quot;Dear husband! Why are you so agitated? You have got what you
	have been longing since long. Now, flourish as a saint: I too shall
	get ready for collecting gifts and offerings.&quot; But on the basis
	of what she had seen of her husband during her 15-year-long
	companionship, she did not take more than a moment to understand
	that Satan could not have come to a righteous and selfless man like
	him, nor could Allah have put him to a severe test. Therefore,
	whatever he had seen was the very truth and reality. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The same
	is also true in the case of Waraqa bin Naufal. He was not an
	outsider, but a member of the Holy Prophet's own clan and a
	brother-in-law by a close relationship. Then being a knowledgeable
	Christian he could discriminate the prophethood and book and
	revelation from fabrication and fraud. Being the Holy Prophet's
	senior by many years his whole life since childhood had been spent
	before him. Therefore, when he heard what the Holy Prophet had to
	say about his experience in the Cave, he at once said that it was
	most surely the same Angel who used to bring Divine messages to the
	Prophet Moses. For in this case also precisely the same thing had
	happened as in the case of the Prophet Moses. He also was a pure and
	righteous person, simple in thought and without any preconceived
	notions about prophethood, he also had experienced the same thing
	unexpectedly in full consciousness similarly. Therefore, without the
	least hesitation, he was led to the firm conclusion that there was
	no self-deception or satanic insinuation involved but whatever the
	truthful man had seen, without any will or desire on his own part,
	was in fact, an experience of the Reality. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is
	such a clear proof of the Holy Prophet Muhammad's Prophethood that a
	realistic person can hardly deny it. That is why it has been
	presented as a proof of Prophethood at several places in the Qur'an
	For example, in Surah Yunus it has been said: &quot;O Prophet, say
	to them: Had Allah willed so, I would never have recited this Qur'an
	to you, nor would He have told you anything (about its existence). I
	have already lived a lifetime among you before its revelation. Do
	you not use common sense?&quot; (v. 16) And in Surah Ash-Shura it
	has been said: &quot;O Prophet, you did not know at all what was the
