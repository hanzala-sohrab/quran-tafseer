<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">According
to authentic Traditions, it was sent down after the affirmation of
the Faith by Hadrat Hamzah and before the affirmation of the Faith by
Hadrat Umar. Muhammad bin Ishaq, the earliest biographer of the Holy
Prophet, has related on the authority of Muhammad bin Ka'b al-Qurzi,
the famous follower of the Companions, that one day some of the
Quraish chiefs were sitting in their assembly in the Masjid al-Haram,
while in another corner of the Mosque there was the Holy Prophet
sitting by himself. This was the time when Hadrat Hamzah had already
embraced Islam and the people of the Quraish were feeling upset at
the growing numbers of the Muslims. On this occasion, Utbah bin
Rabi'ah (the father-in-law of Abu Sufyan) said to the Quraish chiefs:
&quot;Gentlemen, if you like I would go and speak to Muhammad (upon
whom be Allah's peace and blessings) and put before him some
proposals; maybe that he accepts one of them, to which we may also
agree, and so he stops opposing us.&quot; They all agreed to this,
and Utbah went and sat by the Holy Prophet. When the Holy Prophet
turned to him, he said: &quot;Nephew, you know the high status that
you enjoy in the community by virtue of your ancestry and family
relations, but you have put your people to great trouble: you have
created divisions among them and you consider them to be fools: you
talk ill of their religion and gods, and say things as though all our
forefathers were pagans. Now listen to me and I shall make some
suggestions. Consider them well: maybe that you accept one of them.&quot;
The Holy Prophet said: &quot;Abul Walid, say what you want to say and
I shall listen to you.&quot; He said, &quot;Nephew, if by what you
are doing, you want wealth, we will give you enough of it so that you
will be the richest man among us; if you want to became an important
man, we will make you our chief and will never decide a matter
without you; if you want to be a king, we will accept you as our
king; and if you are visited by a jinn, whom you cannot get rid of by
your own power, we will arrange the best physicians and have you
treated at our own expense.&quot; 'Utbah went on speaking in this
strain and the Holy Prophet went on listening to him quietly. Then he
said, &quot;Have you said, O Abul Walid, what you had to say?&quot;
He replied that he had. The Holy Prophet said: &quot;Well, now listen
to me.&quot;Then pronouncing </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Bismilah
ir Rehman-ir-Raihm</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">he began to recite this very Surah,
and Utbah kept on listening to it, putting his hands behind his back
and leaning on them as he listened. Coming to the verse of
prostration (v. 38) the Holy Prophet prostrated himself; then raising
his head, said, &quot;This was my reply, O Abul Walid, now you may
act as you please.&quot; then Utbah arose and walked back towards the
chiefs, the people saw him from afar, and said: &quot;By God! Utbab's
face is changed. He does not look the same man that he was when he
went from here.&quot; Then, when he came back and sat down, the
people asked, &quot;What have you heard?&quot; He replied, &quot;By
God! I have heard something the like of which I had never heard
before. By God, it's neither poetry, nor sorcery, nor magic. O chiefs
of the Quraish, listen to what I say and leave this man to himself. I
think what he recites is going to have its effect. If the other Arabs
overcome him, you will be saved from raising your band against your
brother, and the others will deal with him. But if he overcame
Arabia, his sovereignty would be your sovereignty and his honor your
honor.&quot; Hearing this the chiefs spoke out:&quot;You too, O
father of Walid, have been bewitched by his tongue.&quot; Utbah
replied, &quot;I have given you my opinion; now you may act as you
please.&quot; (Ibn Hisham, vol. I, pp. 313-314). </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">This
story has been narrated by several other traditionists also on the
authority of Hadrat Jabir bin Abdullah in different ways, with a
little variation in wording. In some traditions it has also been
related that when during the recitation the Holy Prophet had come to
verse 13, viz.&quot;If they turn away, say to them: I warn you of a
thunderbolt the like of which had visited the Ad and the
Thamud,&quot;Utbah had spontaneously placed his hand on the Holy
Prophet's mouth, and said: &quot;For God's sake, have mercy on your
people.&quot; Afterwards he justified his action before the Quraish
chiefs, saying: &quot;You know that whatever Muhammad says is always
fulfilled; therefore, I feared lest a torment should descend on us.&quot;

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the discourse that Allah sent down in response to what Utbah said, no
attention whatever was paid to the absurd proposals that he had made
to the Holy Prophet. For what he had said was, in fact, an attack on
the Holy Prophet's intention and his intellect. His assumption was
that as there was no possibility of his being a Prophet and the Quran
being Allah's Revelation, inevitably the motive of his invitation
must either be the desire to obtain wealth and political power, or,
God forbid, he had lost his reason. In the first case, he wanted to
make a bargain with the Holy Prophet; in the second, he was insulting
him when he said that the Quraish chiefs would have been cured of his
madness at their own expense. Obviously, when the opponents come down
to such absurd things, no gentleman would like to answer them, but
would ignore them and say what he himself had to say. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

ignoring what Utbah said, this Surah makes antagonism its subject of
discussion, which the unbelieving Quraish were showing stubbornly and
wickedly in order to defeat the message of the Qur'an. They would say
to tho Holy Prophet, &quot;You may try however hard you try: we would
not listen to you. We have put coverings on our hearts and we have
closed our ears. There is a wall between you and us, which would
never let us meet together.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They
were desperately trying to misconstrue the verses of the Qur'an and
spread every kind of misunderstanding among the people. They
misconstrued everything and found fault even with the straightforward
things. They would isolate words and sentences from their right
context, from here and there, and would add their own words in order
to put new meanings on them so as to mislead the people about the
Quran and the Messenger who presented it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

would raise strange objections a specimen of which has been presented
in this Surah. They said, &quot;If an Arab presents a discourse in
Arabic, what could be the miracle in it? Arabic is his mother tongue.
Anyone could compose anything that he pleased in his mother tongue
and then make the claim that he had received it from God. It would be
a miracle if the person would suddenly arise and make an eloquent
speech in a foreign tongue which he did not know. Then only could one
say that the discourse was not of his own composition but a
revelation from God.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

in that environment of active resistance. Not to speak of preaching
the message to others, the believers were even finding it difficult
to follow the way of the Faith. Any one about whom it became known
that he had become a Muslim, life would become an agony. As against
the dreadful combination of the enemy and its all pervading power,
they were feeling utterly helpless and powerless. In this state, in
the first place, they were consoled and encouraged, as if to say:
&quot;You are not, in fact, helpless and powerless, for any person
who believes in God as his Lord and adheres to this belief and way of
life resolutely, God's angels descend on him and help and support him
at every stage, from the life of this world till the Hereafter.&quot;

insurmountable, the weapon of good morals and character can smash and

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>This
	is a brief introduction to the Surah. A study of the following
	discourse can show what relevance the things mentioned in it have
	with the theme that follows. The first thing said is that this Word
	is being sent down by God, as if to say: &quot;You, O people, may go
	on saying again and again that this Word is being composed by
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) but the fact is that its
	revelation is from God, Lord of the worlds. &quot; Furthermore, the
	addressees have also been warned, so as to say: &quot;If you express
	your displeasure on hearing this discourse. this displeasure is not
	against Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) tart against God. If
	you reject it, you reject Allah's Word, not of a man, and if you
	turn away from it, you do not turn away from a mart but from Allah.&quot;
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	that the one sending it down is that God, Who is extremely Merciful
	(Rehman and Rahim) to His creatures. The mention of the attribute of
	mercy of the Sender of Revelation, instead of any other attributes,
	points to the truth that He has sent down this Word under the
	requirement of His mercifulness. By this the addressees have been
	warned, so as to say: &brvbar;If someone spurns this Word, or
	rejects it. or expresses displeasure at it, he in fact is his own
	enemy &quot;That is indeed a supreme blessing. which God has sent
	down, out of this infinite mercy, for the guidance and well-being
	and happiness of man. if God were merciless to mankind, He would
	have left them to wander about in darkness and would have least
	cared what pit they fell into. But this is His bounty and
	beneficence that along with bringing men into existence and
	providing for them He has taken on Himself the responsibility to
	show them the light of knowledge also in order to adorn their lives,
	and is sending down this Word to a servant of His for the same
	purpose. Now, who could be more ungrateful and a greater enemy of
	himself than the one who instead of benefiting from this mercy made
	up his mind to fight it?&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly
	that the verses of this Book are well-expounded. That is, there is
	nothing confusing and ambiguous in it so that somebody might excuse
	himself from accepting it on the ground that he was unable to
	understand the contents of the Book. It has been plainly told m it
	what is the truth and what is the falsehood, what arc the right
	beliefs and what are the wrong beliefs, what is good and what is
	evil, what is high morality and what is vice, in what way lies the
	good of man and in what he incurs loss for himself. If a person
	rejects such clear and manifest guidance, or pays no heed to it, he
	cannot offer any excuse for it. His attitude clearly implies that he
	wants to remain in the wrong willfully. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Fourthly,
	that this is an Arabic Qur'an, which implies this: &quot;If this
	Qur'an had been sent down in some other language, the Arabs would
	have presented the excuse that they were ignorant of the language in
	which God had sent His Book. But this is their own language. They
	cannot put forward the excuse that they cannot understand it. (Here,
	one should keep in view verse 44 also, in which the same theme has
	been expressed in a different way, and the suspicion that in that
	case there is a reasonable excuse for the non-Arabs not to accept
	the message of the Qur'an, we have already removed in our commentary
	of Surah Yusuf: 2 and E.N. 2 on it. Please also see
	Rasa'il-o-Masa'il. Vol. I, pp. 19-23). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Fifthly,
	that this Book is for those who possess knowledge. That is, only the
	people of understanding can draw any benefit from this Book. For the
	ignorant it is as useless as a precious diamond for the one who
	cannot distinguish it from a mere stone. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Sixthly,
	that this Book gives good news and administers warning. That is, it
	does not consist of mere fantasy, or a philosophy, or a specimen of
	good literary composition, which one may accept or reject without
	entailing any consequence, but it is openly administering a warning
	to the whole world that the results of accepting and believing in it
	are marvelous and of rejecting it very dreadful. Thus only a fool
	could reject it with scant attention.&nbsp;

	meaning of the zakat on property and wealth. According to this

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote12sym" HREF="#sdfootnote12anc">12</A>This
	sentence has been interpreted by the commentators in different ways:
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some of
	them interpret it to mean: &quot;The provisions of the earth were
	placed in it precisely according to the needs and requirements of
	those who ask, in exactly four days.&quot; That is, it took exactly
	four days, neither more nor less. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Ibn
	`Abbas, Qatadah and Suddi interpret it to mean: &quot;The provisions
	of the earth were placed in it in four days. The answer to those who
	ask is completed. &quot; That is, whoever asks as to how long it
	took, his complete answer is that it took four days. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to Ibn Zaid it means: &quot;The provisions of the earth were placed
	in it for those who ask within four days, precisely in accordance
	with the demand and need of everyone. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As far as
	the rules of the language are concerned, the words of the verse
	admit of all these three meanings, but in our opinion the first two
	meanings have no merit. In view of the context, it is immaterial
	whether the work was completed in exactly four days and not in more
	or less four days. There is no need whatever for such an addition to
	make up for any deficiency in supporting the description of Allah's
	perfect power, perfect providence and perfect wisdom. Likewise, the
	commentary: &quot;The answer to those who ask is completed,&quot; is
	a very weak commentary. There is no indication in the theme
	preceding the verse and following it, to show that at that time
	somebody had asked the question as to how long it had taken for
	those works to be completed, and this verse was sent down as an
	answer to it. That is why we have adopted the third meaning in our
	translation. In our opinion the correct meaning of the verse is
	this: &quot;Allah placed within the earth the full provisions of
	food precisely and exactly in accordance with the demands and needs
	of every kind of creature that Allah had to create in the earth from
	the beginning of the creation till Resurrection. There are countless
	kinds of vegetation found on land and in water and the food
	requirements of each kind are different from those of other kinds.
	Allah has created countless species of living creatures in the air
	and on land and in water, and every species demands a different kind
	of food. Then unique among all these is the species of man, who
	requires different kinds of food not only for the development and
	nourishment of his body but also for the satisfaction of his taste.
	Who beside Allah could know how many members of the different kinds
	of creatures would be born on this globe, from the beginning of life
	till its end, and when and where they would be born and how much and
	what kind of food would be required for their nourishment? Just as
	He had made the plan of creating those creatures who stood in need
	of food in His scheme of creation, so He made full arrangements of
	food also to meet their requirements and demands. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	modern age, the people who have brought out the Islamic edition of
	the Marxist conception of Socialism in the name of &quot;the
	Qur'anic order of providence&quot;, translate the words
	sawa-al-lis-sa'-ilin as `equal for all those who ask&quot;, and
	raise the edifice of reasoning on it, saying that Allah has kept
	equal provisions for All the people in the earth; therefore, in
	order to fulfil the intention of the verse a system of the state is
	needed which may provide equal rations of food to everybody. For in
	the system of individual ownership the equality which the &brvbar;Qur'anic
	law&quot; demands cannot be established. But these people, in their
	enthusiasm to press the Qur'an in the service of their theories,
	forget that &brvbar;those who ask&quot;, who have been mentioned in
	this verse, are not only human beings but All those different
	species of animals and plants who need food for survival. Has Allah
	really established equality among all of them, or even among all the
	members of each different species of the creatures, in the matter of
	the provision of food? Do you find anywhere in this entire system of
	nature the arrangement of the distribution of equal rations of food?
	If that is not the case, it means that in the vegetable and animal
	kingdom, where the distribution of the provisions is directly being
	arranged by the State of Allah, and not by the human state, Allah
	Himself is violating His own this &quot;Qur'anic law&quot;, rather,
	God forbid, is practicing injustice! Then, they also forgo that
	&quot;those who ask&quot; also include those animals which man
	domesticates and arranging provisions for which is also his
	responsibility, e.g. sheep, goats, cows, buffaloes, horses, asses,
	mules, camels, etc: If the Qur'anic law is that equal food be given
	to all those who ask, and to enforce the same law a state is needed,
	which may administer the order of providence, will that state
	establish economic equality between men and animals also?&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote13">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote13sym" HREF="#sdfootnote13anc">13</A>Here,
	the commentators generally have been confronted with this question:
	If it is admitted that the creation of the earth took two days and
	the setting up of the mountains and placing of the provisions and
	blessings in it took four days, and the creation of the heavens, as
	mentioned below, took another two days, the total number of the days
	would be eight, whereas at several places in the Qur'an Allah has
	said that the creation of the earth and heavens took six days in
	all. (For example, see AI-A `raf: 54, Yunus: 3, Hud: 7, AI-Furqan:
	59). On this very basis, almost all the commentators agree that
	these four days include the two days of the creation of the earth.
	That is, two days were taken for the creation of the earth and two
	days for the creation of the rest of the things within the earth, as
	mentioned below. Thus, the earth along with its provisions became
	complete in four days in all. But this not only is against the
	apparent words of the Qur'an, but the difficulty also is, in fact,
	an imaginary difficulty, to avoid which need for this interpretation
	has been felt. The two days of the creation of the earth arc, in
	fact, not separate from the two days in which this universe as a
	whole was created. If we consider the following verses, we see that
	in them the creation of both the earth and the heavens has been
	mentioned together, and then it has been stated that Allah made the
	seven heavens in two days. These seven heavens imply the whole
	universe, one part of which is also our earth. Then, when like the
	other countless stars and planets of the universe this earth also
	took the shape of a unique globe within two days, Allah began to
	prepare it for animate creatures, and in four days created in it all
	those provisions which have been mentioned in the above verse. What
	development works were carried out in the other stars and planets in
	these four days have not been mentioned by Allah, for not to speak
	of the man of the period of the revelation of the Qur'an, even the
	man of the present age does not have the capability to digest and
	assimilate this information.</P>

	to mean that first He created the earth, then set mountains in it,
	then arranged blessings and provisions of food in it, and then, at
	the end, He turned towards the creation of the universe. This
	misunderstanding is removed by the following sentence: &quot;He said
	to the heavens and the earth: Come into being; and they said: we
	come in submission. &quot; This makes it clear that in this verse
	and in the following verses, mention is being made of the time when
	there was neither the earth nor the heaven, but the creation of the
	universe was being started. Only the word thumma (then) cannot be
	made the argument to say that the earth had been created before the
	heavens. There are several instances of this in the Qur'an that the
	word thumma is not necessarily used w show the chronological order

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Among the
	earliest commentators the dispute has been going on for ages as to
	what was created first according to the Qur'an, the earth or the
	heavens. One group of them argues on the basis of this verse and
	verse 29 of Al-Baqarah that the earth was created first. The other
	group argues from verses 27-33 of An Nazi'at that the heavens were
	created first, because there it has been clearly stated that the
	earth was created after the heavens. But the fact is that nowhere in
	the Qur'an has the mention of the creation of the universe been made
	to teach Physics or Astronomy, but while inviting towards belief in
	the doctrines to Tauhid and the Hereafter, like countless other
	Signs, the creation of the heavens and the earth also has been
	presented as food for thought. For this purpose it was not at All
	necessary that the chronological order of the creation of the
	heavens and the earth should have been presented, and it should have
	been told whether the heavens were created first or the earth. No
	matter whether this was created first or that, in any case both are
	an evidence of Allah Almighty's being the One and only Deity, and
	are a testimony that their Creator has not created this whole
	universe as a plaything for a care-fret person. That is why the
	Qur'an sometimes mentions the creation of the earth first and
	sometimes the creation of the heavens first. Where the object is to
	make man realize the blessings of God, there generally it has
	mentioned the earth first, for it is closer to man; and where the
	object is to give man the concept of God's greatness and His
	omnipotence there it has generally mentioned the heavens first, for
	the scene of the revolving heavens has always been awe-inspiring for
	man.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote15sym" HREF="#sdfootnote15anc">15</A>In
	these words Allah has described the nature of His method of creation
	in a manner as to differentiate between Divine creation and human
	workmanship. When man wants to make something, he prepares a plan
	for it in his mind: then gathers together the necessary material;
	then works persistently hard to mold the material according to his
	plan, and in the process of his effort the material which he wants
	to mold according to his mental plan constantly resists lute; so
	much so that sometimes the resistance of the material succeeds and
	the thing is not made precisely according to the desired plan, and
	sometimes man's effort overcomes the resistance and he succeeds in
	giving it the desired form and shape. For example, when a tailor
	wants to make a shirt, he first conceives in his mind the shape of
	the shirt, then arranging the cloth he tries to cut and sew it
	according to his concept of the shirt, and during this effort, he
	has constantly to face the resistance of the cloth, for it does not
	easily yield to be molded according to the tailor's concept; so much
	so that sometimes the resistance of the cloth dominates and the
	shirt doesn't take the desired shape, and sometimes the tailor's
	effort dominates and he is able to shape it precisely according to
	his concept. Now, consider Allah's mode of creation. The matter of
	the universe lay scattered and diffused in the form of smoke. Allah
	willed to give it the shape of the universe as it is now. For this
	purpose, He did not have to sit down, like a human artisan, and
	chisel and mold the earth and the moon and the sun and the other
	stars and planets, but He only commanded the scheme of the universe
	that was in His Mind to cane into being, i.e. the smoke like
	diffused matter to take the shape of the galaxies and stars and
	planets, which He wanted to create. This . matter did not have the
	power to resist the Command of Allah. Allah did not have to make any
	effort to give it the shape of the universe. No sooner was the
	Command given than the matter started contracting and condensing and
	taking shape obediently according to the scheme of its Master, so
	that the whole universe including the earth became ready in 48
	hours.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote37sym" HREF="#sdfootnote37anc">37</A>To
	understand the full significance of these words also, one should
	keep in view the conditions in which the Holy Prophet and, through
	him, his followers were given this instruction. The conditions were
	that the invitation to the Truth was being resisted and opposed with
	extreme stubbornness and severe antagonism, in which All bounds of
	morality, humanity and decency were being transgressed. Every sort
	of lie was being uttered against the Holy Prophet and his
	Companions; every kind of evil device was being employed to defame
	him and to create suspicions against him in the minds of the people;
	every kind of accusation was being leveled against him and a host of
	the propagandists were busy creating doubts against him in the
	hearts; in short, he and his Companions were being persecuted in
	every possible way because of which a substantial number of the
	Muslims had been compelled to emigrate from the country. Then the
	program that had been prepared to stop him from preaching was that a
	hand of the mischievous people was set behind him, who would raise
	such a hue and cry that no one should be able to hear anything as
	soon as he opened his mouth to preach his message. In such
	discouraging conditions when apparently every way of extending
	invitation to Islam seemed to be blocked, the Holy Prophet was
	taught this recipe for breaking the opposition. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, it
	was said that goodness and evil are not equal, as if to say:
	&quot;Although apparently your opponents might have raised a
	dreadful storm of mischief and evil, as against which goodness might
	seem absolutely helpless and powerless, yet evil in itself has a
	weakness which ultimately causes its own destruction. For as long as
	man is man, his nature cannot help hating evil. Not only the
	companions of evil, even its own upholders know in their hearts that
	they are liars and wicked people and arc being stubborn for selfish
	motives. Not to speak of creating dignity and honor for them in the
	hearts of others, it lowers them in their own esteem, and causes
	their morale to be weakened and destroyed in the event of every
	conflict. As against this evil, the good which appears to be utterly
	helpless and powerless, goes on operating and working and it becomes
	dominant in the long run. For, in the first place, the good has a
	power of its own which wins the hearts and no man however perverted
	and corrupted, can help esteeming it in his own heart. Then, when
	the good and evil are engaged in a face to face conflict and their
	nature and merits become apparent and known, after a long drawn out
	struggle, not many people would be left, who would not start hating
	the evil and admiring the good. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second,
	it was said that evil should be resisted not by the mere good but'
	by a superior good, as if to say: &quot;If a person treats you
	unjustly and you forgive him, it is the mere good. The superior good
	is that you treat the one who ill-treats you which kindness and
	lout. &quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	result would be that &quot;your worst enemy would become your
	closest friend,&quot; for that is human nature itself. If you remain
	quiet in response to an abuse, it will be mere goodness but it will
	not silence the abuser. But if you express good wishes for him in
	response to his abuses, even the most shameless opponent will feel
	ashamed, and then would hardly ever be able to employ invectives
	against you. If a person doesn't miss any opportunity to harm you,
	and you go on tolerating his excesses, it may well make him even
	bolder in his mischiefs. But if on an occasion he gets into trouble
	and you come to his rescue, he will fall down at your feet, for no
	mischief can hold out against goodness. However, it would be wrong
	to take this general principle in the meaning that every enemy will
	necessarily become a close friend when you have treated him with the
	superior good. There are such wicked people also in the world, whose
	inimical nature will never change for the better no matter how
	tolerantly you may overlook their excesses and how benevolently you
	may react and respond to every evil committed by them. But such
	devil-incarnates are as few in the world as the embodiments of
	goodness are.&nbsp;

	a very efficacious recipe, it is not easy to use. It requires a
	great will power, resolution, courage, power of endurance and full
	control over one's own self. A man may act benevolently in response
	to an evil done, on an impulse, and there is nothing extraordinary
	in it. But when a person has to fight for years and years, for the
	sake of the Truth, those mischievous worshipers of falsehood, who do
	not feel any hesitation in violating any bond of morality, and are
	also intoxicated with power, it requires extraordinary grit to go on
	resisting the evil with good, and that too with the superior good,
	without ever showing any lack of restraint and self-control. Such a
	work can be accomplished only by him who has resolved with a cool
	mind to work for the cause of upholding the Truth, who has subdued
	his self to intellect and sense and in whom good and righteousness
	have taken such deep roots that no malice and mischief of the
	opponents can succeed in deposing him from his high position.&nbsp;

	especially their leaders, to commit such a mistake, even if once, on
	the basis of which he may tell the common people that evil is not
	being committed by one side only: if mean acts are being committed
	by one side, the people of the other side also are not morally any
	better: they too have committed such and such a shameless act. The
	common people do not have the capability that they may assess and
	counterbalance fairly the excesses being committed by one party by
	the reactions of the other. As long as they sec that while the
	opponents ate adopting every mean act yet these people do not swerve
	at All from the path of decency and nobility, goodness and
	righteousness, they continue to regard and esteem them highly. But
	if at some time they happen to commit an unworthy act, even if it is
	in retaliation against a grave injustice, both the sides become
	equal in their esteem, and the opponents also get an excuse to
	counter one blamable act with a thousand abuses. That is why it has
	been said: 'Be on your guard against the deceptions of Satan. He
	will incite you as a well wisher to take note of every abuse and
	every insult and attack and urge you to pay the opponent in the same
	coin, otherwise you would be regarded as a coward and weaken your
	image of strength. &quot; On every such occasion whenever you feel
	any undue provocation, you should take care that this is an
	incitement of Satan who is arousing you to anger and wants you to
	commit a mistake. And after having been warned do not be involved in
	the misunderstanding that you have full control over yourself, and
	Satan cannot make you commit any mistake. This high opinion of ones
	own power of judgment and will is another and more dangerous
	deception of Satan. Instead of it you should seek Allah's refuge,
	for man can save himself from mistakes only if Allah helps and
	grants him protection.

	the presence of the Holy Prophet. Hadrat Abu Bakr kept on hearing
	the invectives quietly and the Holy Prophet kept on smiling at it.
	At last, when Hadrat Abu Bakr could restrain himself no longer, he
	also uttered a harsh word for the person in response. No sooner did
	he utter the word than the Holy Prophet was seized by restraint,
	which appeared on his face, and he rose and left the place
	immediately. Hadrat Abu Bakr also rose and went behind him. On the
	way he asked, 'How is it that as long as the person went on abusing
	me, you kept quiet and smiling, but when I also said a word in
	retaliation, you were annoyed&quot; The Holy Prophet replied, &quot;Until
	you were quiet an angel remained with you, who went on replying to
	him on your behalf, but when you spoke out Satan came in place of
	the angel: I could not sit with Satan. &quot;&nbsp;

	this brief sentence the spiritual disease of the disbelievers of
	Makkah has been clearly diagnosed. It says that they are involved in
	doubt about the Qur'an and the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be
	Allah's peace ), and this doubt has caused them great anguish and
	confusion. That is, although apparently they deny the Qur'an's being
	Allah's Word and the Holy Prophet's being His Messenger very
	vehemently, yet this denial is not based on any conviction, but
	their minds arc afflicted with great vacillation, and doubt. On the
	one hand, their selfish motives, their interests and their
	prejudices demand that they should belie the Qur'an and the Prophet
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) and oppose them strongly; on
	the other, their hearts are convened from within, that the Qur'an
	is, in fact, a unique and un-paralleled Word the like of which has
	never been heard from any literary man or poet. Neither can the
	insane utter such things in their madness, nor can devils come to
	teach God-worship, piety and righteousness to the people. Likewise,
	when they say that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) is a liar,
	their heaps from within put them to shame, and ask: Can such a
	person ever be a liar? When they brand him a madman, their hearts
	cry out from within and ask: Do you really think that he is mad?
	When they accuse that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) is not
	interested in the truth but is working for selfish motives, their
	hearts from within curse them and ask: Do you call this virtuous man
	selfish, whom you have never seen striving for the sake of wealth
	and power and fame, whose life has been free from every tract of
	self-interest, who has always been working to bring about goodness
	and piety, but has never acted from any selfish motives.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote70sym" HREF="#sdfootnote70anc">70</A>This
	verse has two meanings and both have been given by the major
	commentators: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that they will soon see wit their own eyes that the message of the
	Qur'an has spread in all the adjoining lands, and they themselves
	have yielded to it. Then they will realize that what they are being
	told today, which they are denying, was absolutely true. Some people
	have objected to this meaning, saying that a message's being
	dominant and overwhelming vast areas is no argument to prove that it
	is the truth. False messages also become dominant and their
	adherents also go on subduing one country after the other. But this
	is a superficial objection which has been raised without a thorough
	study of the matter. The wonderful conquests that Islam achieved in
	the period of the Holy Prophet and the rightly guided Caliphs, were
	not the Signs of Allah only in the sense that the believers
	conquered one country after the other, but in the sense that this
	conquest of the countries was not like other conquests of the world,
	which make one man or one family or one nation master of the life
	and property of others and God's earth is filled with tyranny and
	injustice. Contrary to this, this conquest brought with it a great
	religious, . moral, intellectual, cultural, political, economic and
	social revolution; whose influence, wherever it reached, elicited
	what was best in man and suppressed what was worst in him. This
	revolution developed and nurtured the moral excellences which the
	world could hope to see only in the hermits and the meditating
	recluses and could never imagine that they could also be found among
	the people responsible for running the worldly affairs-in the
	politics of the rulers, in the chambers of justice, in the wars and
	conquests of the commanders of forces, in the work of the tax
	collectors and in the commerce of the big businessmen. This
	revolution so raised the common people in the society created by it
	in respect of the sense of morality, character, cleanliness and
	purity that even the select people of other societies seemed to be
	much inferior to them. It took man out of the labyrinths of
	superstition and whim and put him on the broad highway of scientific
	research and rational thought and action. It treated and cured these
	diseases of the collective life of whose treatment no idea existed
	in the other systems, or if at all they tried to treat them, they
	did not succeed in it. For example, separation between men on the
	basis of color, race, country and language, classification of men in
	the same society and discrimination among them, non existence of
	legal rights and equality in practical life, degeneration of women
	and their deprivation of the basic rights, prevalence of crime,
	liquor drinking and use of all intoxicating drugs, the governments
	being above criticism and accountability, deprivation of the
	fundamental human rights the masses', disrespect of agreements in
	international relations, barbarism in wars, and such other diseases.
	In Arabia itself this revolution brought about order in place of
	chaos, peace in place of bloodshed and anarchy, piety in place of
	wickedness, justice in place of tyranny and injustice, purity and
	culture in place of filth and indecency, knowledge in place of
	ignorance, brotherhood and love in place of long-standing feuds, and
	it made a nation whose people could not dream of anything beyond
	chiefship of their tribe, leaders of the world. These were the Signs
	which the very generation before whom the Holy Prophet had recited
	this verse for the first time, saw with their own eyes, and after
	that till today Allah has been constantly showing those Signs. The
	Muslims, even during their downfall, displayed such high morals as
	could never be attained by those people who represent as the leaders
	of civilization and culture No precedent can be found from any
	period of the history of the Muslims of the tyrannical treatment
	that has been meted out by the European nations to the subdued
	nations of Africa, America, Asia and of Europe itself. This is the
	blessing of the Qur'an which has so humanized Muslims that they
	could not become so tyrannical even when they had attained
	domination as the non-Muslims have been in all periods of history
	and are even today. A person who has eyes can himself see how the
	Muslims treated the Christians in Spain when they ruled it for
	centuries, and how the Christians treated the Muslims when they
	gained power there; how the Muslims behaved towards Hindus during
	their eight hundred year long rule in India and how the Hindus are
	now treating them after they have attained power; how the Muslims
	treated the Jews during the past 1300 years and how the Jews are
	treating the Muslims in Palestine. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	meaning of this verse is that Allah will show the people in the
	external world around them as well as in their own selves such signs
	as will make manifest that the teaching the Qur'an is giving is the
	very truth. Some people have raised the objection that the people
	even at that time were observing the world around them and also
	their own selves; therefore, it would be meaningless to show them
	any such Signs in the future. But this objection also is as
	superficial as the objection against the first meaning. No doubt,
	the external world is the same as man has been seeing in the past
	and his own self also is of the same nature as has been seen in
	every age, yet in these the Signs of God are so numerous that man
	has never comprehended them fully nor will ever be able to do so. In
	every age man has met with many new Signs and this will go on
	happening till the Resurrection Day.&nbsp;
