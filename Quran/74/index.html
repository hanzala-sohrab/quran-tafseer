earliest Revelation to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
consisted of the first five verses of Surah Al-Alaq(XCVI) However,
what is established by authentic traditions is that after this first
Revelation, no Revelation came down to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) for quite some time. Then, when it was resumed, it started
with theme verses of Surah Al- Muddaththir. Imam Zuhri has given the
following details of it: </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

to the Holy Prophet remained suspended for quite some time, and it
was such a period of deep grief and distress for him that he started
going early to the tops of the mountains to throw himself down from
them. But whenever he stood on the edge of a peak, the Angel Gabriel
would appear and tell him that he was Allah's Prophet. This would
console him and restore to him full peace of mind.&quot; (Ibn Jarir).

has been explained above, the earliest Revelation to the Holy Prophet
(upon whom be peace) consisted of the first five verses of Surah
Al-Alaq, in which it had been Said: &quot;Read (O Prophet), in the
name of your Lord, Who created: created man from a clot of congealed

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
was the first experience of Revelation met with suddenly by the Holy
Prophet (upon whom be peace). in this message it was not told what
great mission he had been entrusted with and what duties he had to
perk form in future. He was only initiated into it and then left
alone for a time so that the great strain this experience had caused
should pass away and he should mentally become prepared to receive
the Revelation and perform the prophetic mission in the future. After
this intermission when Revelation Was resumed, the first seven verses
of this Surah Were revealed:In these he Was for the first time
commanded to arise and warn the people of the consequences of the way
of life they were following and to proclaim the greatness of God in
the world where others were being magnified without any right. Along
with that he was given this instruction: The demand of the Unique
mission that you have to perform, now is that your life should be
pure in every respect and you should carry out the duty of reforming
your people sincerely irrespective of any worldly gain. Then, in the
last sentence, he was exhorted to endure with patience, for the sake
of his Lord, all the hardships and troubles that he might have to
face while performing his mission. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the implementation of this Divine Command when the Holy Messenger of
Allah began to preach Islam and recite the Qur'anic Surahs revealed
successively, the people of Makkah felt alarmed, and it provoked a
great storm of opposition and hostility. A few months passed in this
state until the Hajj season approached. The people of Makkah feared
that if Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) started visiting the
caravans of the pilgrims coming from all over Arabia at their halting
places and reciting the spell binding and unique Revelations of the
Qur'an in their assemblies on the occasion of Hajj, his message would
reach every part of Arabia and influence countless people. Therefore,
the Quraish chiefs held a conference and settled that they would
start a propaganda campaign against the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) among the pilgrims as soon as they arrived. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
they had agreed on this, Walid bin al-Mughirah said to the assembled
people: &quot;If you said contradictory things about Muhammad (upon

among the people. Therefore, let us agree upon one opinion, which we
should all say without dispute. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

they utter has no remote resemblance with the Qur'an.&rdquo; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Muhammad.&rdquo; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
he said: &quot;Whichever of these things you said about Muhammad, it
would be known to be a false accusation. By God, his speech is sweet,
his root is deep and his branches are fruitful.&rdquo; At this Abu
Jahl urging on Walid said: &ldquo;Your people will never be pleased

after prolonged thought and consideration, he said: &ldquo;The
nearest thing to the truth is that you tell the Arabs that he is a
sorcerer, who has brought a message by which he separates a man from
his father; and from his brother, and from his wife and children, and
from his family.&rdquo; They all agreed on what Walid had proposed. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Quraish chiefs themselves made the name of the Holy Messenger known
throughout Arabia. (Ibn Hisham, pp. 288-289. That Walid had made this

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In

will see the evil result of what you are doing today on the

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 11-26, without naming Walid bin al-Mughirah, it has been told how
Allah had blessed him and how inimical he proved to be to true Faith.
In this connection, his mental conflict has been portrayed, telling
that, on the one hand, he was fully convinced of the truth of
Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) and the Qur'an,
but, on the other, he did not want to risk his leadership and
position among his people. Therefore, not only he did not believe
himself but after a long-drawn-out conflict with his conscience he
also came out with the proposal that in order to restrain the people
from believing the Qur'an should be branded as magic. After exposing
his evil nature, it has been said: &quot;Notwithstanding such evil
inclinations and misdeeds, this person desires that he should be
further blessed, whereas he has now become worthy of Hell, and never
of further blessings.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 27-48, the dreadfulness of Hell has been depicted and it has been
explained as to people of what character and morals really deserve
it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 49-53, the root cause of the disbelievers' aversion has been
pointed out, saying: &quot;Since they are fearless of the Hereafter,
and look upon this worldly life as an end in itself, they flee from
the Qur'an as though they were wild asses fleeing away from the lion:
therefore, they propose unreasonable conditions for believing,
whereas even if each and every condition of theirs was fulfilled,
they could not advance even an inch on the way of Faith with their
denial of the Hereafter.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, it has been explicitly stated: Allah does not stand in
need of anybody's faith that He may fulfill his conditions. The
Qur'an is an admonition that has been presented before the people
openly; now whoever wills may accept it. Allah has a right that the
people should fear His disobedience and He alone has the power to
forgive the one who adopts piety and an attitude of God consciousness
even though one may have committed many acts of disobedience in the
past. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	study of the background of the revelation of these verses given in
	the introduction above can help one understand why the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) on this occasion has been addressed with Ya
	ayyuhal-Muddaththiru instead of Ya ayyuhar-Rasulu (O Messenger), or
	Ya ayyuhan-Nabiyyu (O Prophet). As the Holy Prophet had been
	terrified when he had suddenly seen the Angel Gabriel (on whom be
	peace), sitting on a throne between heaven and earth, and had
	returned hastily home and asked the people of the house to cover him
	up, so Allah addressed him with Ya ayyuhal-Muddaththiru. From this
	fine way of address the meaning which automatically follows is: &quot;O
	My dear Servant, why have you lain down thus enwrapped? You have
	been put under the. burden of a great mission: you must now arise
	from your solitude to perform this mission with resolution and
	courage.&quot;&nbsp;

	command of this very nature had been given to the prophet Noah
	(peace be on him) while appointing him to the office of Prophet
	hood; &quot;Warn the people of your nation before they are overtaken
	by a painful torment.&quot; (Nuh: 1) The verse means: &quot;O you
	who lies enwrapped, stand up and arouse the people who live in
	heedlessness around you: warn them of the fate which would certainly
	overtake them if they remained involved in the same heedlessness,
	Warn them that they are not living in a lawless kingdom where they
	are free to conduct themselves as they like and where they can do
	wherever they please without any fear or being called to account for
	it. &quot;&nbsp;

</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>This
	is the primary duty of a Prophet, which he has to perform in this
	world. His foremost duty is to refute the greatness of all those
	whom the ignorant people might be holding as great, and publicly
	proclaim that we greatness in this universe belongs to none but
	Allah alone. For this very reason the phrase Allahu Akbar has been
	Geld as of supreme importance in Islam. The adhan (call to prayer)
	begins with the proclamation of Allahu Akbar. The Muslim enters the
	Prayer itself with Allahu Akbar and repeats Allahu Akbar every time
	he sits or stands, He pronounces Bismillahi Allahu Akbar also when
	slaughtering an animal. The slogan of Allahu Akbar has become a most
	distinctive and prominent emblem of Muslims throughout the world
	today, for the Prophet of this Ummah himself had embarked on his
	mission with the magnification and glorification of Almighty Allah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here,
	there is another fine point, which must be understood well. As we
	have learned from the background of the revelation of these verses,
	this was the first occasion when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) had been commanded to arise for performing the duties of the
	great mission of Prophethood, and it was obvious that the city and
	society in which he was commanded to perform this mission, was the
	center of polytheism. Not only were the people around him
	polytheistic like the common Arabs but, more than that, the city of
	Makkah had become the most sacred place of pilgrimage for the
	polytheistic Arabs, and the Quraish were its attendants. Arising of
	a person in such a place all by himself and proclaiming the Oneness
	of God in the face of polytheism was full of risks. That is why the
	exhortation to &quot;proclaim the greatness of your Lord&quot; just
	after &quot;arise and warn&quot; contains this meaning also: &quot;Do
	not at all mind the terrifying and dreadful forces that seem to be
	obstructing and impeding your work and proclaim publicly that your
	Lord is the greatest of all those who can hinder and resist you from
	giving your message. This is indeed the greatest encouragement for a
	person who embarks on a Divine mission. The one who has Allah's
	greatness and majesty deeply embedded in his heart will feel no
	hesitation at all in facing and fighting the entire world by himself
	for the sake of Allah.&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote4">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>These
	are very comprehensive words, which are full of meaning.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">They mean
	this: &quot;Keep your garments free from every filth and impurity,
	for the purity of the body and garments and the purity of the spirit
	are inter-linked and inter-dependent. &quot; A pure spirit and an
	impure body with impure garments cannot live together. The society
	in which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had arisen with the
	invitation to Islam, was not only steeped in the evils of unbelief
	and immorality, but was also devoid of even the most elementary
	concepts of purity and cleanliness, and the Holy Prophet's task was
	to teach its members cleanliness in every way of life. Therefore he
	was instructed to establish and present a high standard of purity in
	his external life as well. Thus, it is the result of the same
	instruction that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) gave mankind
	such detailed teaching about the cleanliness of the body and
	garments as is not possessed even by the most civilized nations of
	today, not to speak of the Arabs of the pre-Islamic days of
	ignorance. So much so that in most of the languages of the world
	there is no word synonymous with &quot;taharat&quot; &quot;. On the
	contrary, in Islam every book of the Hadith and Fiqh begins with
	injunctions and instructions on taharat (purity), which
	distinguishes between purity and impurity and gives minute details
	about the methods and means of obtaining purity.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second meaning of these words is: &quot;Keep your garments neat and
	clean.&quot; The criterion of religiosity given to the world by the
	monastic concepts was that a man was holy to the extent he was
	unclean. If a person happened to put on neat clothes, he was looked
	upon as a worldly man, whereas the fact is that human nature abhors
	filth and uncleanness and even a person of ordinary fine taste loves
	to be associated only with a neat and clean person. On this very
	basis, for the one calling the people to Allah it was made
	imperative that externally also he should look so neat and clean
	that the people should regard him with esteem and his personality
	should not be stained in any way so as to repel others.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	meaning of this Divine Command is: &quot;Keep your garments free
	from moral evils: your dress should be neat and clean but it should
	bear no tinge of vanity and pride, display and exhibition, pomp and
	show. &quot; The dress is the first thing that introduces the
	personality of a person to others. The kind of dress a person wears
	makes the people judge at first sight what kind of a man he is. The
	dresses of the rulers and princes, the dresses of the religious
	functionaries, the dresses of the vain and conceited people, the
	dresses of the mean and shallow people, the dresses of the
	evil-natured and characterless people, all represent the tastes and
	tempers of those who wear them. The temper of the one calling to
	Allah is naturally different from all such people. Therefore, his
	dress also should necessarily be different from all of them. He
	should wear such a dress as .should make everyone else feel that he
	is a noble and refined person, who is not involved in any evil of
	the self.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Its
	fourth meaning is: Keep away from moral evils. Ibn `Abbas, Ibrahim
	Nakha`i, Sha`bi, `Ata', Mujahid. Qatadah, Sa`id bin Jubair, Hasan
	Basri and other major commentators have given this very meaning to
	this verse: keep yourself morally pure and avoid all that is
	blameworthy. In Arabic usage also when it is said: &quot;So and so
	is clean in his garments&quot;, it implies that he is morally good
	and pure; on the contrary, when it is said: &quot;He is filthy in
	his garments&quot;, it means that he is dishonest and fraudulent in
	his dealings: he is unreliable.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>&quot;Filth&quot;
	implies every kind of filth, whether of belief and thought, of
	morals and deeds, of the body, dress or mode of life. The verse
	means: &quot;Keep yourself free from the filth of evils which are
	prevalent in society around you: no one should ever impute to you
	the blame that your own life itself is stained in some degree with
	the evils that you tell others to avoid.&quot;</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote20sym" HREF="#sdfootnote20anc">20</A>Some
	commentators have explained it thus: &quot;As in the scriptures of
	the Jews and Christians themselves also the same number of the
	angels has been mentioned as keepers of Hell, they would be
	convinced of this thing's being truly from Allah as soon as they
	heard it.&quot; But in our opinion this commentary is not correct
	for two reasons. First, we have not been able to see anywhere in the
	existing scriptures of the Jews and Christians in spite of search
	that the number of the angels appointed over Hell is 19. Second,
	there are many things in the Qur'an, which also have been mentioned
	in the scriptures of the Jews and Christians, yet they explain them
	away, saying that the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace
	and blessings) has plagiarized these from their books. For these
	reasons the correct meaning of this statement in our opinion is: The
	Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)
	knew fully well that he would be ridiculed as soon as the
	disbelievers heard that 19 angels had been appointed over Hell, but
	in spite of this, he presented without the least hesitation and fear
	publicly before the people what had been revealed to him from Allah,
	and did not at all mind the jesting and mocking by the people. The
	pagans of Arabia were unaware of the unique distinction of the
	Prophets, but the followers of the earlier scriptures were fully
	aware that the Prophets in every age used to convey to their people
	intact whatever they received from God, whether it pleased them or
	displeased them. On this very basis it was to be expected of the
	Jews and the Christians that they would be convinced of the Prophet
	Muhammad's truth for only a Prophet could present an apparently
	strange thing without any hesitation before the people in an
	environment charged with antagonism and hostility. This also is
	evident that such a thing was shown by the Holy Prophet on many
	other occasions. Its most prominent example is the event of the
	mi'raj (ascension) which he related openly before a general assembly
	of the disbelievers and did not at all care how his opponents would
	behave and react after they had heard the story of the wonderful

	has been explained at several places in the Qur'an above that on the

	loyalty to it, it increases and strengthens him all the more in

	&quot;sickness of the heart&quot; in the Qur'an is generally
	understood to imply hypocrisy, seeing this word here some
	commentators have expressed the view that this verse was revealed at
	Madinah, for the hypocrites appeared at Madinah. But this view is
	not correct for several reasons. In the first place, the assertion
	itself that there were no hypocrites at Makkah is false, and its
	false-hood has been exposed in the Introduction to the Surah
	Al-`Ankabut and in its vv. 1011. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	in our opinion it is not a correct way of writing commentary that in
	respect of a certain sentence occurring in a particular discourse
	which was revealed on a particular occasion, under particular
	circumstances, one should declare that it had been sent down on
	another occasion but has been inserted here without any relevance.
	The historical background of this part of Surah Al Muddaththir is
	fully well known to us from authentic traditions. This was revealed
	in connection with a particular event of the earliest period of the
	life at Makkah. The whole context bears full relevance to the event.
	What could, therefore, be the occasion in this context that this one
	sentence, if it was revealed many years later at Madinah, should
	have been inserted here? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the question what is implied by the disease of the heart here, its
	answer is that it implies the disease of doubt. Not only in Makkah
	but in the entire world also there have been, and are, very few such
	people, who might deny God, Hereafter, Revelation, Prophethood,
	Heaven. Hell, etc. absolutely. In every age the greater majority by
	far has been of those people, who have been involved in the doubt
	whether there is God, or no God, Hereafter or no Hereafter, whether
	Heaven and Hell really exist, or are mere figments of the
	imagination, and whether the Messengers did really come and receive
	Revelation or not. This same doubt has led most people to unbelief,
	otherwise the number of such people in the world who denied these
	truths absolutely has never been great. For a person who has any
	common sense knows that there is no rational ground whatever for
	denying the possibility of the existence of these things, or of
	declaring them absolutely impossible.&nbsp;

	straight path, but which when heard by an obstinate, perverse and

	is, &quot;We were not of those who after having believed in Allah
	and His Messenger and His Book, performed the foremost duty imposed
	by Allah, i.e. the Prayer. &quot; Here, it should be understood well
	that unless a person has believed he cannot offer the Prayer at all.
	Therefore, one's being of those who performed the Prayer, by itself
	implies that one is a believer. But by attributing one's going to
	Hell to one's not being of those who performed their Prayer, it has
	been made explicit that one cannot escape Hell even after having
	believed if one does not perform one's Prayers regularly.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote36sym" HREF="#sdfootnote36anc">36</A>That
	is, &quot;Even if an intercessor interceded for a person who
	persisted in this way of life till death, he would not be forgiven.&quot;
	The question of intercession has been so fully explained at so many
	places in the Qur'an that no one can have any difficulty in knowing
	and understanding as to who can intercede and who cannot, when one
	can intercede and when one cannot, for whom one can intercede and
	for whom one cannot, and for whom intercession is beneficial and for
	whom it is not. As one of the major causes of the people's deviation
	in the world, is their false concept about intercession, it has been
	explained at such length in the Qur'an as to leave no room for any
	doubt and ambiguity. For example, see Al-Baqarah; 255, Al-An`am: 94,
	Al-A`raf: 53. Yunus: 3-18, Maryam: 87, Ta Ha: 109, Al-Anbiya': 28,
	Saba: 23, Az-Zumar: 43-44, Al-Mu'min: 18, Ad-Dukhan: 86, An-Najm:
	26, An-Naba: 37-38.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote38sym" HREF="#sdfootnote38anc">38</A>That
	is, they desire that if Allah really has appointed Muhammad (upon
	whom be Allah's peace and blessings) as His Prophet, He should send
	a letter to each one of the chiefs and elders of Makkah telling him
	that Muhammad is Allah's Prophet; therefore he should obey and
	follow him. And these letters should be such as may convince them
	that they have been written by Allah Himself. At another place in
	the Qur'an, this saying of the disbelievers of Makkah has been
	cited: &quot;We will not believe in it unless we are given the like
	of what has been given to the Messengers of Allah.&quot; (Al-An`am:
	124). At still another place their this demand has been cited: &quot;Or
	you ascend the sky ... and bring down to us a writing that we may
	read.&quot; (Bani lsra'il: 93).</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote39sym" HREF="#sdfootnote39anc">39</A>That
	is, the real cause of their failure to affirm the faith is not that
	their demands are not fulfilled, but the real cause is that they are
	fearless of the Hereafter. They think that this world is an end in
	itself and they do not have any idea that there is another life
	after this worldly life in which they will have to render an account
	of their deeds. This very thing has made them careless and
	irresponsible in the world. They regard the question of truth and
	falsehood as utterly meaningless, for they do not see any truth
	following which may have necessarily led to a good result in the
	world, nor do they see any falsehood which might have always led to
	an evil result in the world. Therefore, they think it is useless
	merely to consider as to what is really true and what is false. This
	question can be worthy of serious consideration only for the person
	who regards the present life of the world as transitory and admits
	that the real and everlasting life is the life hereafter, where the
	truth will necessarily lead to a good result and falsehood
	necessarily to an evil result. Such a person will certainly believe
	when he sees the rational arguments and the pure teachings presented
	in the Qur'an and will use his common sense to understand what is
	actually wrong with the beliefs and deeds which the Qur'an calls
	wrong. But the denier of the Hereafter who is not at all serious in
	his search for the truth, will present ever new demands every day
	for not believing, and will present a new excuse for his denial even
	if all his demands are fulfilled. This same thing has been expressed
	in Surah Al-An`am: 7 thus: &quot;O Prophet, even if We had sent down
	to you a Book written in paper, and even if they had touched it with
	their own hands. the disbelievers would have said: `This is nothing
	but manifest sorcery. &quot;&nbsp;</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote41sym" HREF="#sdfootnote41anc">41</A>That
	is, a person's taking heed does not wholly depend upon his own will,
	but he takes heed only when Allah also wills to grant him the grace
	to take heed. In other words, the truth that has been expressed here
	is that no act of man takes a concrete shape solely by his own will,
	but each act is implemented only when the will of God combines with
	the will of the man. This is a very delicate question, failure to
	understand which has often made human thought falter. Briefly it can
	be understood thus: If in this world every man had the power to
	accomplish whatever he wanted to accomplish, the system of the world
	would be disturbed. This system continua to hold only because the
	will of Allah is .dominant over all other wills. Man can accomplish
	whatever he wants to accomplish only when Allah also wills that he
	be allowed to accomplish it. The same is also the case with guidance
	and error. Only man's own desiring to have guidance is not enough
	for him to have guidance; he receives guidance only when Allah also
	takes a decision to fulfill his desire. Likewise, only man's
	desiring to go astray by itself is also not enough, but when Allah
	in view of his desire decides that he be allowed to wander into evil
	ways, then he wanders into the evil ways in which Allah allows him
	to wander. As for example, if a person wants to become a thief, only
	his desire is not enough that he may enter into any house he likes
	and matte away with whatever he likes, but he can fulfill his desire
	only at the time and to the extent and in the form that Allah allows
	him to fulfill it, according to His supreme wisdom and expedience.&nbsp;
