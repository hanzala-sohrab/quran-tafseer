the first five verses not only have the state of Resurrection been
described vividly but an argument of its being true and certain also
have been given. It has been stated that the heavens on that Day will
split asunder, the earth will be spread out plain and smooth, and it
will throw out whatever lies inside it of the dead bodies of men and
evidences of their deeds so as to become completely empty from
within. The argument given for it is that such will be the Command of
their Lord for the heavens and the earth; since both are His
creation. they cannot dare disobey His Command. For them the only
right and proper course is that they should obey the Command of their
Lord. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

in vv 6-19 it has been said that whether man Is conscious of this
fact or not, he in any case is moving willy nilly to the destination
when he will appear and stand before his Lord. At that time all human
beings will divide into two parts: first those whose records will be
given in their right hands: they will be forgiven without any severe
reckoning; second those whose records will be given them behind their
back. They will wish that they should die somehow, but they will not
die; instead they will be cast into Hell. They will meet with this
fate because in the world they remained lost in the misunderstanding
that they would never have to appear before God to render an account
of their deeds, whereas their Lord was watching whatever they were
doing, and there was no reason why they should escape the
accountability for their deeds. Their moving gradual]y from the life
of the world to the meting out of rewards and punishments in the
Hereafter was as certain as the appearance of twilight after sunset,
the coming of the night after the day, the returning of men and
animals to their respective abodes at night, and the growing of the

	same thing has been expressed, thus: &quot;He will turn the earth
	into an empty level plain, wherein you will neither see any curve
	nor crease.&quot; (vv 106-107) Hakim in Mustadrak has related
	through authentic channels on the authority of Hadrat Jabir bin
	'Abdullah a saying of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) to the
	effect: &quot;On the Resurrection Day the earth will be flattened
	out and spread out like the table-cloth; then there will hardly be
	room on it for men to place their feet.&quot; To understand this
	saying one should keep in mind the fact that out that Day all men
	who will have been born from the first day of creation till
	Resurrection, will be resurrected simultaneously and produced in the
	Divine Court. For gathering together such a great multitude of the
	people it is inevitable that the oceans, rivers, mountains, jungles,
	ravines and all high and low areas be leveled and the entire globe
	of the earth be turned into a vast plain so that all individuals of

	it. Though his evil deeds also will be there along with his good
	deeds in his records, his errors will be overlooked and pardoned in
	view of his outweighing good deeds. In the Holy Qur'an, for the
	severe reckoning of the wicked people the words su-al-hisab (heavy
	reckoning) have been used (Ar-Ra'd: 18), and concerning the
	righteous it has been said: &quot;From such people We accept the
	best of their deeds and overlook their evils.&quot; (Al-Ahqaf: 16).
	The explanation of it given by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	has been related in different words by Imam Ahmad Bukhari, Muslim,
	Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Abu Da'ud, Hakim, Ibn Jarir, `Abd bin Humaid, and
	Ibn Marduyah on the authority of Hadrat 'A'ishah. According to one
	of these traditions the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said:
	&quot;Doomed will be he who is called to account for his deeds.
	Hadrat 'A'ishah said: O Messenger of Allah, has not Allah said: 'He
	whose record is given in his right hand shall have an easy
	reckoning?' The Holy Prophet replied: That is only about the
	presentation of the deeds, but the one who is questioned would be
	doomed.&quot; In another tradition Hadrat 'A'ishah has related: &quot;I
	once heard the Holy Prophet supplicate during the prayer, thus: O
	God, call me to a light reckoning. When he brought his Prayer to
	conclusion, I asked what he meant by that supplication. He replied:
	Light reckoning means that one's conduct book will be seen and one's
	errors will be overlooked. O 'A'ishah, the one who is called to
	account for his deeds on that Day, would be doomed.&nbsp;

	is, his way of life was different from that of God's righteous men,
	about whom in Surah At-Tur: 26, it has been said that they lived
	among their kinsfolk in fear and dread of God, i.e. they fear lest
	they should ruin their own Hereafter on account of their absorption
	in the love of children and endeavors for the sake of their
	well-being and prosperity in the world. On the contrary, this man
	lived a life free from every care and worry and helped his children
	and kinsfolk also to enjoy life fully, no matter what wicked and
	immoral methods he had to use to procure the means of enjoyment, how
	he had to usurp the rights of others and transgress the bounds set
	by Allah for the sake of the worldly pleasures.&nbsp;

	have to pass through countless stages gradually, from youth to old

	state between death and Resurrection), from barzakh to Resurrections
	from Resurrection to the Plain of Assembly, then to the Reckoning,

	are some of those things which testify that rest and stillness is
	unknown in the universe in which man lives. There is a continuous
	and gradual change taking place everywhere. Therefore, the

	man has breathed his last.&nbsp;

	do not fall prostrate&quot;: they do not bow down to God out of fear
	of Him. To perform a sajdah (prostration) here is confirmed by the
	practice of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). lmam Malik,
	Muslim and Nasa'i have related a tradition concerning Hadrat Abu
	Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him), saying that he recited this
	Surah in the Prayer and performing a sajdah here said: &quot;The
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) performed a sajdah at this point.&quot;
	Bukhari; Muslim, Abu Da'ud and Nasa'i have cited this statement of
	Abu Rafi`: &quot;Hadrat Abu Huraira recited this Surah in the 'Isha'
	Prayer and performed a sajdah When I asked why he had done so, he
	replied: I prayed under the leadership of Abul Qasim (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) and he performed a sajdah here. Therefore, I will
	continue to perform this sajdah likewise as long as 1 live.&quot;
	Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah and others have
	related another tradition saying that Hadrat Abu Huraira said: &quot;We
	performed sajdah behind the Holy Messenger of Allah in this Surah
	and in Iqra' bi-ismi Rabbik-alladhi khalaq.&nbsp;
