<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
contents of this Surah testify that it was sent down after the hijrah
at Madinah at the time when the fighting had been enjoined, though
active fighting had not yet been undertaken. Detailed arguments in
support of this view have been given in E. N. 8 below. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
conditions at the time when this Surah was sent down were such that
the Muslims were being made the target of persecution and tyranny in
Makkah in particular and in Arabia in general, and life had become
miserable for them. Although the Muslims had emigrated to the haven
of Madinah from every side, the disbelieving Quraish were not
prepared to leave them alone and let them live in peace even there.
Thus, the small settlement of Madinah was hemmed in by the enemy, who
was bent upon exterminating it completely. The only alternative left
with the Muslims were that either they should surrender to the forces
of ignorance, giving up their mission of preaching the true Faith, or
even following it in their private lives, or should rise to wage a
war at the cost of their lives to settle finally and for ever whether
Islam would stay in Arabia or the creed of ignorance. On this
occasion Allah showed the Muslims the same way of resolution and
will, which is the only way for the true believers. He first
permitted them to fight in Surah Al Hajj 39 and then enjoined
fighting in Al Baqarah 190. But at that time everyone knew fully well
what it meant to wage a war in those conditions. There were only a
handful of Muslims in Madinah, who could not muster even a thousand
soldiers; yet they were being urged to take up the sword and clash
against the pagan forces of the whole of Arabia. Then the kind of the
weapons needed to equip its soldiers for war could hardly be afforded
by the town in which hundreds of emigrants were still homeless and
unsettled even by resort to starving its members at a time when it
had been boycotted economically by the Arabs on all sides. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Such

prepare the believers for war and to give them preliminary

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At
the outset it is said that of the two groups confronting each other
at this time, one has refused to accept the Truth and has become an
obstruction for others on the way of Allah, while the other group has
accepted the Truth which had been sent down by Allah to His servant,
Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings). Now, Allah's
final decision is that He has rendered fruitless and vain all the
works of the former group and set right the condition and affairs of
the latter group. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this, the Muslims have been given the initial war instructions they
have been reassured of Allah's help and guidance: they have been
given hope for the best rewards on offering sacrifices in the cause
of Allah and they have been assured that their struggle in the cause
of the Truth will not go to waste, but they will be abundantly
rewarded both in this world and in the Hereafter. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Furthermore,
about the disbelievers it has been said that they are deprived of
Allah's support and guidance: none of their designs will succeed in
their conflict with the believers, and they will meet a most evil
fate both in this world and in the Hereafter. They thought they had
achieved a great success by driving the Prophet of Allah out of
Makkah, but in fact by this they had hastened their own doom. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">After
this, the discourse turns to the hypocrites, who were posing to be
sincere Muslims before the command to fight was sent down, but were
confounded when this command actually came down, and began to
conspire with the disbelievers in order to save themselves from the
hazards of war. They have been plainly warned to the effect that no
act and deed is acceptable to Allah of those who adopt hypocrisy with
regard to Him and His Prophet. There, the basic issue against which
all those who profess the Faith are being tried is whether one is on
the side of the Truth or Falsehood, whether one's sympathies are with
Islam and the Muslims or with disbelief and the disbelievers, whether
one keeps one's own self and interests dearer or the Truth which one
professes to believe in and follow. One who fails in this test is not
at all a believer; his Prayer and his Fasting and his discharging of
the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">zakat</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">deserve no reward from Allah. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
the Muslims have been exhorted not to lose heart for being small in
numbers and ill equipped as against the great strength of the
disbelievers: they should not show weakness by offering peace to
them, which might still further embolden them against Islam and the
Muslims, but they should come out with trust in Allah and clash with
the mighty forces of disbelief. Allah is with the Muslims: they alone
shall triumph; and the might of disbelief will be humbled and
vanquished. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, the Muslims have been invited to spend their wealth in
the cause of Allah. Although at that time they were economically very
weak, the problem that they confronted was the very survival of Islam
and the Muslims. The importance and delicacy of the problem demanded
that the Muslims should not only risk their lives for safeguarding
themselves and their Faith from the dominance of disbelief and for
exalting Allah's Religion but should also expend their economic
resources as far as possible in the preparations for war. Therefore,
they were clearly warned to the effect. Anyone who adopted a
niggardly attitude at the time, would not, in fact, harm Allah at
all, but would result in his own destruction, for Allah does not
stand in need of help from men. If one group of men shirked offering
sacrifices in the cause of His Religion, Allah would remove it and
bring another group in its place. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;lt
	does not behoove a Prophet to have captives until he has crushed
	down the enemies in the land. You desire the gains of this world,

	All-Wise. Had not a decree already been issued by Allah, you would
	have incurred a severe chastisement in consequence of what you have
	done. So eat of what you have taken as spoils because it is lawful
	and pure. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A careful
	study of this passage, especially of its italicized portions, shows
	that what had displeased Allah on this occasion was that before
	crushing down the enemy completely in the Battle of Badr, the
	Muslims had started taking the enemy soldiers as captives, whereas
	the instruction given them in Surah Muhammad before the actual
	fighting was this: &quot;When you have crushed them completely, then
	bind the captives tight. &quot; However, as the Muslims had been
	permitted, among other things in Surah Muhammad, to accept ransom
	from the prisoners, Allah declared the money taken from the captives
	of Badr as lawful and did not punish them for that. The words &quot;Had
	not the decree already been issued by Allah.&quot; are clearly
	pointing to the fact that the command for permission to accept
	ransom had already been given in the Qur'an before this event, and
	obviously, there is no other verse in the Qur'an beside this verse
	of Surah Muhammad, which contains this command. Therefore, it will
	have to be admitted that this verse had been sent down before the
	above-cited verse of the Surah AI-Anfal. (For explanation, see E. N
	49 on AI-Anfal). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is
	the first verse of the Qur'an in which preliminary instructions have
	been given about the laws of war. Below is given a resume of the
	injunctions that are derived from this verse and the Holy Prophet's
	and his Companions' practice according to it and the juristic
	inferences as based on this verse and the Sunnah: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	real aim of the Muslim army in war is to break the fighting power of
	the enemy till it is crushed and the war lays down its arms. Under
	no circumstances, should the Muslim's lose sight of this aim and
	start taking the enemy soldiers as captives. Captives should be
	taken after the enemy has been completely crushed and its numbers
	thinned down. The Arabs have been so instructed at the outset lest
	in the greed for ransom and taking slaves they should forget and
	overlook the real aim of the war. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) About
	the prisoners taken in war it has been said: &quot;You have the
	option whether you show them favor or accept ransom from them. &quot;
	This gives the general law that the prisoners of war should not be
	put to death. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar, Hasan Basri, `Ata' and
	Hammad bin Abi Sulaiman favour this view, which is quite valid. They
	say that a man can be killed only during the war. When the war is
	over and one has been made a prisoner, it is not lawful to kill him,
	Ibn Jarir and Abu Bakr alJassas have related that Hajjaj; bin Yusuf
	handed over one of the prisoners of war to Hadrat `Abdullah bin
	`Umar and commanded him to put him to death. He refused to obey and
	cited this verse and said: &quot;We are not allowed to kill a man
	when he is a prisoner.&quot; Imam Muhammad in As-SiyaT al-Kabir also
	has related that `Abdullah bin 'Amir had commanded Hadrat `Abdullah
	bin `Umar to kill a prisoner of war, and he had refused to obey the
	command for this reason. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) But
	since in this verse it has neither been clearly forbidden to kill
	the prisoner the -Holy Prophet understood this intention of Allah's
	Command, and also acted accordingly, that if there was a special
	reason for which the ruler of an Islamic government regarded it as
	necessary to kill a particular prisoner (or prisoners), he could do
	so. This is not the general law, but an exception to it, which would
	be applied only when necessary. Thus, the Holy Prophet put to death
	only `Uqbah bin Abi Mu'ait and Nadr bin al-Harith from among the 70
	prisoners taken at Badr, and only the poet Abu `Azzah from the
	prisoners taken at Uhud. Since the Bani Quraizah had surrendered on
	the condition that they would accept whatever decision Hadrat Sa`d
	bin Mu'adh would give in their regard, and he had decreed that all
	the males of the Quraizah should be killed, the Holy Prophet had
	them executed. From among the prisoners taken at Khaiber only
	Kinanah bin Abi al-Huqaiq was put to death because of his violating
	the agreement. At the conquest of Makkah, the Holy Prophet commanded
	in respect of only a few particular persons from among all the
	inhabitants of Makkah that any one of them who was captured should
	be put to death. Apart from these exceptions, the Holy Prophet never
	killed prisoners of war, and the same also continued to be the
	practice of the righteous Caliphs. During their times also killing
	of prisoners of war was rare, which was resorted to only for a
	special reason. Hadrat, `Umar bin `Abdul `Aziz also during his
	caliphate put to death only one prisoner of war for the reason that
	he had persecuted the Muslims very cruelly. On this very basis the
	majority of the jurists have held the view that the Islamic
	government can put a prisoner to death if necessary. But it is for
	the government to take such a decision; every soldier is not
	permitted to kill any prisoner he likes. However, if there is the
	danger of a prisoner's running away or of his committing a dangerous
	mischief, the guard can kill him. In this connection, the jurists of
	Islam have also made three other points: (a) That if a prisoner
	accepts Islam, he cannot be killed; (b) that the prisoner can be
	killed only as long as he is in the government's custody; if he has
	been allotted to, or given in somebody else's possession by sale, he
	cannot be killed; and (c) that if the prisoner has to be killed, he
	should be killed in a straightforward way; he should not be tortured
	to death 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	general command that has been given about the prisoners of war is:
	&quot;Show them favor, or accept ransom from them. &quot; Favor
	includes four things: (a) That they should be treated well as
	prisoners; (b) that instead of killing them or keeping them in
	captivity for lifetime, they should be handed over to the individual
	Muslims as slaves; (c) that they should be put under jizyah and
	trade dhimmis; and (d) that they should be set free without ransom. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are
	three ways of ransoming them: (a) That they should be set free on
	payment of a ransom; (b) that they should be set free after taking
	some special service from them; and (c) that they should be
	exchanged for the Muslim prisoners of war who are in the possession
	of the enemy. The Holy Prophet and the Companions at different times
	acted in one or the other way as the occasion demanded. The Divine
	Law has not bound the Islamic government to act in only one
	particular way. The government can take any action it deems
	appropriate on a particular occasion. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) The
	practice of the Holy Prophet and the Companions confirms that as
	long as a prisoner of war is in the government's custody, the
	government will be responsible for his food and clothing, . and his
	treatment if he is ill or wounded. Islamic Law does not permit
	prisoners to be kept without food or clothing, or be subjected to
	torture. On the contrary, instructions also have been given to treat
	them well and generously, and precedents of this very practice are
	found in the Sunnah. The Holy Prophet distributed the prisoners of
	Badr in the houses of different Companions and gave the instruction:
	&quot;Teat these prisoners well.&quot; One of those prisoners, Abu
	'Aziz, has reported: &quot;The Ansar Muslims, in whose house I was
	kept, gave me bread morning and evening, but as for themselves they
	had only dates to eat. &quot; About another prisoner; Suhail bin
	'Amr, the Holy Prophet was told: &quot;He is a fiery speaker, and
	has been making speeches against you: please have his teeth broken.
	&quot; The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;If I have his teeth broken,
	Allah will break my teeth, although I am a Prophet.&quot; (Ibn
	Hisham). When Thumamah bin Uthal, the chief of Yamamah, was brought
	as a prisoner, he was provided with good food and milk on the Holy
	Prophet's orders as long as he remained a captive. (Ibn Hisham). The
	same was the practice in the time of the Companions. No precedent is
	found when a prisoner might have been mistreated in their time. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) Islam
	has not permitted that the prisoners be kept in captivity for ever
	so that the government may subject them to forced labor as long as
	it likes. If they are not exchanged for other prisoners of war, or
	ransomed, the method enjoined of doing them favor is that they
	should be made slaves and given in possession of individuals, and
	their masters instructed to treat them well This method was acted
	upon during the time of the Holy Prophet as well as of the
	Companions, and the jurists of Islam have unanimously upheld it as
	permissible. In this regard, it should be borne in mind that a
	person who might have accepted Islam before being taken as prisoner,
	and then is somehow made a prisoner, will be set free, but the
	acceptance of Islam by a person who accepts it after being taken
	prisoner, or after being given in possession of somebody, will not
	gain him freedom automatically. A tradition has been related in
	Musnad Ahmad. Muslim and Tirmidhi on the authority of Hadrat `Imran
	bin Husain that a person from among the Bani 'Uqail was brought as a
	prisoner and he said: &quot;I have accepted Islam. &quot; Thereupon
	the Holy Prophet said: &quot;If you had said this when you were
	free, you would certainly have attained to success. The same thing
	was said by Hadrat `Umar: &quot;When a prisoner becomes a Muslim
	after falling into the hands of the Muslims as a captive, he will
	not be killed, but will remain a slave.&quot; Oh this very point.
	the jurists of Islam have unanimously ruled that the prisoner who
	becomes a Muslim after being taken captive cannot escape slavery.
	(Imam Muhammad, As-Siyar al-Kabir). And this also is quite
	reasonable. If our law had been that anyone who embraced Islam after
	being taken a captive, would be set free, no prisoner would be so
	foolish as not to win his freedom by pronouncing the Kalimah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) The
	third manner of doing favor with the prisoners according to the Law
	of Islam is that they may be put under jizyah and made dhimmi
	subjects of the Islamic state and allowed to live as free citizens
	of dar a/Islam (abode of Islam) just like the Muslims. Imam Muhammad
	writes in his As-Siyar a/-Kabir: &quot;Any person who can be made a
	slave, can also be made a dhimmi and put under jizyah. &brvbar; At
	another place he says: &quot;The ruler of the Muslims has the right
	to levy jizyah on than and a tax on their lands and set than
	absolutely free. &quot; This method has been practised generally in
	the condition when the territory of the people who have been made
	prisoners, is' conquered and annexed to the Islamic state. The Holy
	Prophet, for instance, practiced this method in the case of the
	people of Khaiber, and then Hadrat `Umar followed and practiced it
	extensively on the conquest of `Iraq and other territories. Abu
	`Ubaid writes in his Kitab al-Amwal: &quot;After the conquest of
	`Iraq a deputation of the leading men of that country came before
	Hadrat `Umar and submitted: `O Commander of the Faithful, before
	this the people of Iran had subdued us: they subjected us to harsh
	treatment and committed all sorts of excesses against us. Then, when
	God sent you, we became very pleased, and we neither put up any
	resistance against you nor participated in the war. Now, we hear
	that you want to make us slaves.' Hadrat `Umar replied: `You have
	the option either to become Muslims, or accept to pay jizyah and
	remain free.' They agreed to pay the jizyah and they were granted
	full freedom. &quot; At another place in the same book. Abu `Ubaid
	says: Hadrat `Umar wrote to Abu Musa al-Ash'ari: Set free every
	farmer and peasant from among the people who have been captured in
	the war. &quot; <BR>(8) The fourth favor is that the prisoner be set
	free without ransom. This is a special concession that the Islamic
	government can give only in case the special conditions of a
	prisoner demand it, or when it is expected that the concession will
	win the prisoner's gratitude for ever, and help turn him a friend
	from an enemy, or a believer from a disbeliever; otherwise,
	obviously it would in no way be a wise thing to set free a person of
	the enemy camp, who could again return to fight the Muslims. This is
	why the Muslim jurists generally have opposed it, and imposed the
	condition: &quot;If the ruler of the Muslims finds it expedient to
	set the prisoners, or some of them, free as a favor, there is no
	harm in doing so.&quot; (As-SiyaT al-Kabir). Many precedents of this
	are found in the time of the Holy Prophet, and in almost every case
	expediency seems to be the reason. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">About the
	prisoners taken at Badr, he said: &quot;If Mut'im bin `Adi were
	alive, and had spoken to me in respect of these treacherous people,
	I would have Iet them go for his sake.&quot; (Bukhari, Abu Da'ud,
	Musnad Ahmad). The Holy Prophet said this because when he had
	returned from Ta'if to Makkah, Mut'im at that time had given him
	refuge, and his armed sons had escorted him to the Ka`bah.
	Therefore, he wanted to repay his debt of gratitude in this way. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to Bukhari, Muslim and Musnad Ahmad, when Thumamah bin Uthal, the
	chief of Yamamah, was brought as a prisnoner, the Holy Prophet asked
	him: &quot;Thumamah, what do you say?&quot; He replied: &quot;If I
	am killed, then such a one would be killed, whose blood has some
	value: if I am shown favor, then favor would be shown to a person,
	who appreciates favor; and if you want wealth, ask for it, you will
	be given it.&quot; For three days the Holy Prophet asked him the
	same thing and he gave the same reply. At last, the Holy Prophet
	ordered that Thumamah be set free. On attaining freedom, he went to
	a nearby oasis, washed himself and came back, pronounced the kalimah
	and became a Muslim, saying: Before this day nobody was more
	detestable than you and no religion more odious than your religion
	in my sight, but now for me no man is more lovable than you and no
	religion more lovable than your religion.&quot; Then he went to
	Makkah for 'Umrah and gave the people of Quraish a notice to the
	effect: &quot;After this no grain will reach you from Yamamah unless
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) permits it.&quot; So, he
	stopped the grain supply and the people of Makkah had to request the
	Holy Prophet that he should not stop the supply of grain for them
	from Yamamah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From
	among the prisoners of the Bani Quraizah, the Holy Prophet forgave
	Zabir bin Bata and 'Amr bin Sa'd (or Ibn Su'da), the former because
	he had given refuge to Hadrat Thabit bin Qais Ansari in the Battle
	of Bu'ath, in the pre-Islamic days of ignorance; therefore, he
	handed him over to Hadrat Thabit that he may repay him for his
	favor. And he forgave 'Amr bin Sa`d because it was he who was
	exhorting his tribe not to be treacherous when the Bani Quraizah
	were committing breach of the trust with the Holy Prophet. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After the
	Battle of Bani al-Mustaliq, when the prisoners were brought and
	distributed among the people, the Holy Prophet paid Hadrat
	Juwairiyah's ransom to the person to whom she was allotted to secure
	her freedom and then married her himself. At this all the Muslims
	set their own prisoners free, saying: &quot;Now they have become the
	Holy Prophet's relatives. &quot; Thus, the prisoners of a hundred
	families became free. (Musnad Ahmad, Tabaqat Ibn Sa`d, Ibn Hisham). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On the
	occasion of the treaty of Hudaibiyah, at about dawn, 80 men came
	from the direction of Tan'im with the intention of launching a
	sudden attack on the Muslim camp, but were all captured, and the
	Holy Prophet set all of them free lest it became a cause of war on
	that critical occasion. (Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi, Musnad
	Ahmad). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">At the
	conquest of Makkah, the Holy Prophet forgave all the people of
	Makkah except only a few men, and did not kill more than three or
	four of even those who had been made an exception. The whole of
	Arabia was well aware of what atrocities the people of Makkah had
	committed against the Holy Prophet and the Muslims; yet the
	large-heartedness with which he forgave them after attaining
	complete victory over them, gave the Arabs the satisfaction that
	they had not been overpowered by a tyrant but by a merciful,
	affectionate and generous leader. That is why after the conquest of
	Makkah the Arabian peninsula did not take longer than two years to
	be completely subdued. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After the
	Battle of Hunain, when the Hawazin deputation came to secure the
	freedom of their prisoners, the prisoners had already been
	distributed. The Holy Prophet called the Muslims together and said:
	&quot;These people have come with repentance, and I am of the
	opinion that their men should be rearmed to them. The one who would
	like to set the prisoner allotted to him free willingly without
	ransom, should set him free, and the one who would like to take
	ransom, shall be paid it out of the first income that is received in
	the Public Treasury.&quot; Thus, six thousand prisoners were set
	free, and those who wanted to take ransom, were given it by the
	government. (Bukhari, Abu Da'ud, Musnad Ahmad, Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd).
	This also shows that the government is not authorized to set the
	prisoners free after they have been distributed; this can be done by
	the willing approval of those in whose possession the prisoners have
	been given, or by paying them the ransom. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After the
	Holy Prophet, precedents of setting the prisoners free as a favor
	continue to be found throughout the period of the Companions also.
	Hadrat Abu Bakr set fret Ash'ath bin Qais al-Kindi and Hadrat 'Umar
	granted freedom to Hurmuzan and the prisoners of Manadhir and
	Maisan. (Abu 'Ubaid, Kitab alAmwal). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(9) The
	precedent of setting the prisoners free on payment of the ransom in
	the time of the Holy Prophet is found only on the occasion of Badr,
	when the prisoners were set free on payment of one thousand to four
	thousand dirhams each. (Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, Kitab al-Amwal). No
	precedent of this is found in the time of the Companions; and the
	jurists of Islam have generally disapproved it, for it means that we
	should take money and set a man free so that he may again rise
	against us with the sword. But since taking of ransom has been
	permitted in the Qur'an, and the Holy Prophet also acted according
	to it once, it is not absoluutely forbidden. Imam Muhammad writes in
	his As-Siyar al-Kabir that if the need arises the Muslims can free
	their prisoners on payment of the ransom. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(10) The
	criterion of freeing a prisoner for a service rendered is also found
	in connection with the Battle . of Badr. For those of the Quraish
	prisoners who had no ransom the Holy Prophet imposed the condition
	that they should teach reading and writing to ten Ansar children
	each to win their freedom. (Musnad Ahmad, Tabaqat Ibn Sa`d, Kitab
	al-Amwal. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(11)
	Several instances of the exchange of prisoners are found in the time
	of the Holy Prophet. Once he dispatched Hadrat Abu Bakr on an
	expedition and he brought some captives, including a beautiful
	woman, who fell to the lot of Hadrat Salamah bin Akwa' . The Holy
	Prophet urged him to give her back, then sent her to Makkah and had
	several ' Muslim prisoners released, in exchange for her. (Muslim,
	Abu Da'ud, Tahawi Kitab al-Amwal of Abi `Ubaid, Tabaqat Ibn Sa`d).
	Hadrat 'Imran bin Husain relates that once the tribe of Thaqif
	arrested two men of the Muslims. Some time later, a man of the Bani
	'Uqail, who were allies of the Thaqif, was arrested by the Muslims.
	The Holy Prophet sent him to Ta'if and got both the Muslims released
	in exchange for him. (Muslim, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad). From among
	the jurists Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad, Imam Shafe`i, Imam Malik
	and Imam Ahmad hold . the exchange of the prisoners as permissible.
	A ruling of Imam Abu Hanifah is that exchange should not be
	practiced, but according to another ruling of his exchange can be
	practiced. However, there is a consensus that the prisoner who
	becomes a Muslim should not be handed over to the disbelievers for
	the purpose of exchange.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	explanation makes it abundantly clear that Islam has formulated a
	comprehensive code in respect of the prisoners of war, which
	contains provision for this problem in every age under all sorts of
	conditions. Those people who take this Qur'anic verse in its simple
	meaning that the prisoners of war should &quot;either be shown favor
	and set free or freed for ransom&quot;, do not know what different
	aspects the question of the , prisoners of war has, and what
	problems it has been creating in different ages and can create in
	the future. &nbsp;

	never be involved in the misunderstanding that he has done and
	accomplished whatever he was required to do. Rather, on the
	contrary, he should have the feeling that he has not been able to do
	full justice to what was expected of him by his Lord and Master.
	Therefore, he should confess his errors constantly and pray to Allah
	saying 'Lord, forgive me for whatever fault and error I may have
	committed in Your service.&quot; 'this is indeed the essence of
	Allah's Command: 'O Prophet. ask forgiveness for your fault ..''
	'This does lint mean that God forbid. the Holy Prophet had actually
	committed an error willfully, but its correct meaning is that it did
	not even behoove the servant who was the greatest worshiper of his
	Lord that Ire should harbor even a tinge of the pride of
	accomplishment in his heart, but Iris true position also was that in
	spite of all his great :end glorious services he should continue
	confessing his shortcomings before Iris Lord. It was under this
	state of the mind that the Holy Prophet often implored his Lord for
	forgiveness. According to Abu Da'ud and Nasa'i, the Holy Prophet is

	Islam and the Muslims at that time the believers were generally of
	the opinion that they should be permitted to fight even before
	fighting was actually enjoined by Allah. Rather they were asking
	Allah's Command in this regard impatiently and were awaiting again
	and again: &quot;Why are we not permitted to fight these wicked
	people '?&quot; But the condition of the people who had joined the
	ranks of the Muslims hypocritically was quite different from that of
	the believers. They held their lives and their properties as dearer
	to themselves than Allah and His Religion, and were not prepared to
	risk them at any cost. Therefore, as soon as fighting was enjoined
	they were clearly sorted out from the true believers. fill the time

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	verse clearly points out that Islam forbids severing of relations
	with the kindred. On the other hand, in positive terms also, at
	several places in the Qur'an, treating the relatives kindly and well
	has been enjoined and counted among the major virtues. (For
	instance, see AI-Baqarah: 83, 177: An-Nisa': 8, 36; An-Nahl: 90.
	Bani Isra'il: 26; An-Nur: 22). The word rahm in Arabic is used far
	kinship and relationship by blood metaphorically. AII the relations
	of a person, whether near or distant, are his kinsmen (dhwil-arham).
	The nearer the relationship the greater the right one has upon the
	other and graver the sin of severing the ties of blood. To treat the
	kindred well implies that one should do one's utmost in doing
	whatever good one possibly can to one's relative, should avoid doing
	any ill or harm to him. Reasoning from this very verse Hadrat 'Umar
	had forbidden as unlawful selling of the slave girl who had given
	birth to a child from her master, and the Companions had concurred
	with him in this. Hakim in his Musradrik has related on the
	authority of Hadrat Buraidah that one day when he was sitting among
	the audience of Hadrat 'Umar, suddenly a clamor arose in the street.
	On inquiring it was known that a slave girl was being sold and her
	daughter was crying, Hadrat 'Umar immediately got the Ansar and the
	Muhajirin together and put before them the question: &brvbar;Do you
	find in the Religion that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) has
	brought any room for severing of relations between the blood
	relationships?&quot; Everybody replied in the negative. Thereupon,
	Hadrat 'Umar said: Then, how is it that in your houses a mother is
	being separated from her daughter? Could there be a greater and more
	serious instance of the cutting of these relationships? Then he
	recited this verse. The people said: You may adopt whatever measure
	you deem fit to stop this practice. At this Hadrat 'Umar issued this
	decree for enforcement in all the Islamic territories: &quot;No
	slave-girl who has given birth to a child from her master is to be
	sold because this is breaking of kinship ties which is not lawful.&quot;
