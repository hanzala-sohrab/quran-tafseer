<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>According
to a tradition related in Bukhari and Muslim, on the authority of
Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, once the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
was going to Visit the Fair of Ukaz with some of his Companions, On
the way be led the Fajr Prayer at Nakhlah. At that time a company of
the jinn happened to pass that way. When they heard the Quran being
recited, they tarried and listened to it attentively. This very event
has been described in this Surah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most
of the commentators, on the basis of this tradition, believe that
this relates to the Holy Prophet's well known journey to Taif, which
had taken place three years before the Hijrah in the 10th year of the
Prophethood. But this is not correct for several reasons. The jinn's
hearing the Qur'an during the journey to Taif has been related in
Al-Ahqaf 29-32. A cursory reading of those verses shows that the jinn
who had believed after hearing the Qur'an on that occasion were
already believers in the Prophet Moses and the previous scriptures.
On the contrary, vv. 2- 7 of this surah clearly show that the jinn
who heard the Qur'an on this occasion were polytheists and deniers of
the Hereafter and Prophethood. Then, it is confirmed historically
that in his journey to Taif none accompanied the Holy Prophet except
Hadrat Zaid bin Harithah. On the contrary, concerning this journey
Ibn Abbas says that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was
accompanied by some of his Companions. Furthermore, the traditions
also agree that in that journey the jinn heard the Qur'an when the
Holy Prophet had stopped at Nakhlah on his return journey from Taif
to Makkah, and in this journey, according to the traditions of Ibn
Abbas, the event of the jinn's hearing the Qur'an occurred when the
Holy Prophet was going to Ukaz from Makkah. Therefore, in view of
these reasons what seems to be correct is that in Surah Al-Ahqaf and
Surah Al Jinn, one and the same event has not been narrated, but
these were two separate events, which took place during two separate
journeys. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
far as Surah Al-Ahqaf is concerned, it is agreed that the event
mentioned in it occurred on the return journey from Taif in the 10th
year of Prophethood. As for the question, when this second event took
place, its answer is not given by the tradition of Ibn Abbas, nor any
other historical tradition shows as to when the Holy Prophet had gone
to the Fair of Ukaz along with some of his Companions. However, a
little consideration of vv 8-10 of this surah shows that this could
only be an event of the earliest stage of Prophethood. In these
verses it has been stated that before the appointment of the Holy
Prophet (upon whom be peace) to Divine Mission the jinn used to have
one or another opportunity to eavesdrop in the heavens in order to
hear news of the unseen, but after it they suddenly found that angels
had been set as guards and meteorites were being shot on every side
so that they could find no place of safety from where they could hear
the secret news. Thereupon they had set about searching for the
unusual thing that had occurred on the earth, or was going to occur,
because of which the security measures had been tightened up.
Probably since then many companies of the jinn must have been moving
about in search of the unusual occurrence and one of them after
having heard the Qur'an from the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
must have formed the opinion that that was the very thing for the
sake of which all the gates of the heavens had been shut against the
jinn. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before
one starts the study of this Surah one must clearly know what is the
reality of the jinn so as to avoid any possible mental confusion.
Many people of the modern times are involved in the misunderstanding
that the jinn are not real, but only a figment of the ancient
superstition and myths. They have not formed this opinion on the
basis that they have known all the realities and truths about the
universe and have thus discovered that the jinn do not exist. They
cannot claim to possess any such knowledge either. But they have
assumed without reason and proof that nothing exists in the universe
except what they can see, whereas the sphere of human perceptions as
against the vastness of this great universe is not even comparable to
a drop of water as against the ocean. Here, the person who thinks
that what he does not perceive, does not exist, and what exists must
necessarily be perceived, in fact, provides a proof of the narrowness
of his own mind. With this mode of thought, not to speak of the jinn,
man cannot even accept and acknowledge any reality, which he cannot
directly experience and observe, and he cannot even admit the
existence of God, to say nothing of admitting any other unseen
reality. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Those
of the Muslims who have been influenced by modernism, but cannot deny
the Qur'an either, have given strange interpretations of the clear
statements of the Qur'an about the jinn, Iblis and Satan. They say
that this does not refer to any hidden creation, which may have its
own independent existence, but it sometimes implies man's own animal
forces, which have been called Satan, and sometimes it implies savage
and wild mountain tribes, and sometimes the people who used to listen
to the Qur'an secretly. But the statements of the Qur'an in this
regard are so clear and explicit that these interpretations bear no
relevance to them whatever. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Qur'an frequently mentions the jinn and the men in a manner as to
indicate that they are two separate creations. For this, see Al Araf:
38, Hind : 119, Ha Mim As-Sajdah: 25,29, Ahqaf: 18, Adh Dhariyat: 56,
and the entire surah Ar-Rahman, which bears such clear evidence as to
leave no room to regard the jinn as a human species. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
Surah Al Hijr: 27, it has been said that the jinn had been created
before man. The same thing is testified by the story of Adam and
Iblis, which has been told at seven different places in the Qur'an,
and at every place it confirms that Iblis was already there at the
creation of man. Moreover, in surah Al-Kahf: 50, it has been stated
that Iblis belonged to the jinn. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

surah Al-Hijr: 16-l8, surah As- Saaffat: 6-10 and surah Al-Mulk: 5,
it has been said that although the jinn can ascend to the heavens,
they cannot exceed a certain limit; if they try to ascend beyond that
limit and try to hear what goes on in the heavens, they are not
allowed to do so, and if they try to eavesdrop they are driven away
by meteorites. By this the belief of the polytheistic Arabs that the
jinn possess the knowledge of the unseen, or have access to Divine
secrets, has been refuted. The same error has a]so been refuted in
Saba: 14. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Al-Baqarah:
30-34 and Al- Kahf: 50 show that Allah has entrusted man with the
vicegerency of the earth and the men are superior to the jinn.
Although the jinn also have been given certain extraordinary powers
and abilities an example of which is found in An-Naml 39, yet the
animals likewise have been given some powers greater than man, but
these are no argument that the animals are superior to man. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Qur'an also explains that the jinn, like men, are a creation
possessed of power and authority, and they, just like them, can
choose between obedience and disobedience, faith and disbelief. This
is confirmed by the story of Satan and the event of the jinn
affirming the faith as found in Surahs Al-Ahqaf and Al-Jinn. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At
scores of places in the Qur'an, it has also been stated that Iblis at
the very creation of Adam had resolved to misguide mankind, and since
then the Satanic jinn have been persistently trying to mislead man,
but they do not have the power to overwhelm him and make him do
something forcibly. However, they inspire him with evil suggestions,
beguile him and make evil seem good to him. For this, see An-Nisa
117- 120, Al-Araf: 11-17, Ibrahim: 22, Al-Hijr: 30-42, An-Nahl
98-100, Bani Israil 61-65. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Qur'an also tells us that in the pre Islamic ignorance the
polytheistic Arabs regarded the jinn as associates of God, worshiped
them and thought they were descended from God. For this, see
A1-An'am: 100, Saba : 40-41, As Saffat: 158. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From
these details, it becomes abundantly clear that the jinn have their
own objective existence and are a concealed creation of an entirely
different species from man. Because of their mysterious qualities,
ignorant people have formed exaggerated notions and concepts about
them and their powers, and have even worshiped them, but the Qur'an
has explained the whole truth about them, which shows what they are
and what they are not. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this Surah in vv. 1-15, it has been told what was the impact of the
Qur'an on the company of the jinn when they heard it and what they
said to their fellow jinn when they returned to them. Allah, in this
connection, has not cited their whole conversation but only those
particular things which were worthy of mention. That is why the style
is not that of a continuous speech but sentences have been cited so
as to indicate that they said this and this. If one studies these
sentences spoken by the jinn carefully, one can easily understand the
real object of the narration of this event of their affirming the
faith and or mentioning this conversation of theirs with their people
in the Qur'an. The explanations that we have given of their
statements in our Notes will be of further help in understanding this
object. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this, in vv 16-l8, the people have been admonished to the effect:&quot;If
you refrain from polytheism and follow the way of righteousness
firmly, you will be blessed; otherwise if you turn away from the
admonition sent down by Allah, you will meet with a severe
punishment.&quot; Then, in vv. 19-23, the disbelievers of Makkah have
been reproached, as if to say: When the Messenger of Allah calls you
towards Allah, you surround and mob him from every side, whereas the
only duty of the Messenger is to convey the messages of Allah. He
does not claim to have any power to bring any gain or cause any harm
to the people.&quot; Then, in vv. 24-25 the disbelievers have been
warned to the effect: &quot;Today you are trying to overpower and
suppress the Messenger seeing that he is helpless and friendless, but
a time will come when you will know who in actual fact is helpless
and friendless. Whether that time is yet far off, or near at hand,
the Messenger has no knowledge thereof, but it will come to pass in
any case.&quot; In conclusion, the people have been told: The Knower
of the unseen is Allah alone. The Messenger receives only that
knowledge which Allah is pleased to give him. This knowledge pertains
to matters connected with the performance of the duties of
Prophethood and it is delivered to him in such security which does
not admit of any external interference whatever. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	know the language of the people of that region. But in any case this

	This same thing is confirmed by Al-Ahqaf: 29-30, where it has been
	stated that the jinn who had then heard the Qur'an, were from among
	the followers of the Prophet Moses, and they after having heard the
	Qur'an, had invited their people to believe in the Revelation that
	had been sent down by God confirming the previous scriptures. Surah
	ArRahman also points to the same, for its whole subject-matter shows

	had to spend a night in some uninhabited, desolate valley, they
	would shout out: &quot;We seek refuge of the jinn, who is owner of
	this valley.&quot; In other traditions of the pre-Islamic ignorance
	also the same thing has been reported frequently. For example, if in
	a place they ran short of water and fodder, the wandering Bedouins
	would send one of their men to some other place to see if water and
	fodder were available; and when they reached the new site under his
	direction, they would shout out before they halted to pitch the
	camp: &quot;We seek refuge of the sustainer of this valley so that
	we may live here in peace from every calamity.&quot; They believed
	that every un-inhabited place was under the control of one or
	another jinn, and if someone stayed there without seeking his
	refuge, the jinn would either himself trouble the settlers, or would
	let others trouble them. These believing jinn are referring to this
	very thing. They meant that when man, the vicegerent of the earth,
	started fearing them without any reason, and started seeking their

	there were the people who denied both the Prophethood and the
	Hereafter. However, in view of the theme that follows, the meaning
	that we have given in the text above is preferable, for according to

	shows that such extraordinary measures were adopted in the heavens
	only on two kinds of occasions: first, when Allah might decide to
	inflict the dwellers of the earth with a torment, and the Divine
	will might be that before it was actually inflicted the jinn might
	not know and convey its news to warn their friendly human beings of
	the impending disaster. Second, that Allah might appoint a Messenger
	on the earth, and strict security measures might be adopted so that
	neither the messages being conveyed to him be interfered with by the
	satans nor should they be able to know beforehand what instructions
	were being given to the Messenger. Thus, the saying of the jinn
	means: &quot;When we noticed that strict security measures had been
	adopted in the heavens for the safeguard of the news, and the
	meteorites were being showered profusely, we wanted to know which of
	the two things had happened: whether Allah had caused a torment to
	descend suddenly on some people of the earth, or a Messenger had
	been raised somewhere on the earth. We were on the lookout for the
	same when we heard the wonderful Revelation, which guides to the
	Right Path, and we came to know that Allah had not sent down a
	torment but had raised a Messenger to show the Right Way to the
	people.&quot; For further explanation, see E.N.'s 8 to 12 of

	belong to Allah. Not to speak of benefiting or harming others, I do
	not have the power to cause good or harm even to myself. If I
	disobey Allah, I cannot seek and have refuge anywhere from His
	punishment, and 1 have no helper and protector beside Allah.&quot;

	does not mean that every sin and act of disobedience will cause one
	to live in Hell for ever, but in view of the context in which this
	thing bas been said, the verse means: the one who does not accept
	the invitation to Tauhid given by Allah and His Messenger and does
	not refrain from polytheism will suffer in Hell for ever.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote24">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote24sym" HREF="#sdfootnote24anc">24</A>The
	background of this verse is that those of the Quraish who used to
	mob and surround the, Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) as soon as
	they heard his invitation calling to Allah, were under the delusion
	that they had a strong band at their back and that the Holy Prophet
	had only a handful of men with him, and therefore, they would easily
	overwhelm him. At this it is being said: Today these people find the
	Messenger helpless and friendless and themselves supported and
	strengthened by great hosts and, therefore, feel encouraged and
	emboldened to suppress the invitation to the Truth. But when the
	evil time with which they are being threatened comes, they will know
	who in actual fact is helpless and friendless.&nbsp;

	style itself shows that this is an answer which has been given
	without citing the question. Probably, hearing what has been said
	above, the opponents might have asked mockingly and tauntingly:
	&quot;When will the time with which you are threatening us come?&quot;
	In response, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was commanded to
	say: &quot;The time will certainly come, but I have not been told
	the date of its coming. Allah alone knows whether is will come soon,
	or whether a distant term has been set for it. &quot;&nbsp;

	realities to the Messenger by revelation, He appoints angels on
	every side to safeguard it so that the knowledge reaches the
	Messenger in a safe condition, free from every kind of adulteration.
	This is the same thing which has been expressed in vv. 8-9 above,
	saying: After the appointment of the Holy Messenger the jinn found
	that all the doors to the heavens had been closed, and they noticed
	that strict security measures had been adopted because of which no
	room had been left for them to eavesdrop.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The words
	of the verse are comprehensive and may possibly imply all the three
	meanings. Besides, the verse also points out two other things:
	first, that the Messenger is given that knowledge of the unseen,
	which is necessary for him to perform his mission of Prophethood;
	second, that the angels keep watch that the Revelation reaches the
	Messenger safely and also that the Messenger conveys the messages of
	his Lord to His servants precisely and accurately.&nbsp;

	the angels cannot dare add or subtract even a letter from them.</P>
