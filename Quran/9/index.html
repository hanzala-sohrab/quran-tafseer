<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">the Holy Prophet dispatched Hadrat Ali
to follow Hadrat Abu Bakr, who had already left for Makkah as leader
of the Pilgrims to the Ka'abah. He instructed Hadrat Ali to deliver

second discourse (vv., 38-72) was sent down in Rajab A.H. 9 or a

Campaign of Tabuk. There are some pieces in this discourse that were
sent down on different occasions during the same period and were
afterwards consolidated by the Holy Prophet into the Surah in
accordance with inspiration from Allah. But this caused no
interruption in its continuity because they dealt with the same
subject and formed part of the same series of events. This discourse
warns the hypocrites of their evil deeds and rebukes those Believers
who had stayed behind in the Campaign of Tabuk. Then after taking

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now
let us consider the historical background of the Surah. The series of
events that have been discussed in this Surah took place after the
Peace Treaty of Hudaibiyah. By that time, one-third of Arabia had
come under the sway of Islam which had established itself as a
powerful, well organized and civilized Islamic State. This Treaty
afforded further opportunities to Islam to spread its influence in
the comparatively peaceful atmosphere created by it. After this
Treaty, two events took place, which led to very important results: </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<H2 STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Conquest
of Arabia</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
first was the Conquest of Arabia. The Holy Prophet was able to send
missions among different clans for the propagation of Islam. The
result was that during the short period of two years, it became such
a great power that it made the old order of ignorance' feel helpless
before it. So much so that the zealous elements from among the
Quraish were so exasperated that they broke the Treaty in order to
encounter Islam in a decisive combat. But the Holy Prophet took
prompt action after the breach so as not to allow them any
opportunity to gather enough force for this. He made a sudden
invasion on Makkah in the month of Ramadan in A. H. 8 and conquered
it. Though this conquest broke the backbone of the order of
ignorance, it made still another attack on Islam in the battle-field
of Hunain, which proved to be its death-knell. The clans of Hawazin
Thaqif, Naur, Jushm and others gathered their entire forces in the
battle field in order to crush the reformative Revolution, but they
utterly failed in their evil designs. The defeat of 'ignorance' at
Hunain paved the way for making the whole of Arabia the 'Abode of
Islam' (</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Dar-ul-Islam</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">).
The result was that hardly a year had Passed after the Battle of
Hunain, when the major portion of Arabia came within the fold of
Islam and only a few upholders of the old order remained scattered
over some corners of the country. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
second event that contributed towards making Islam a formidable power
was the Campaign of Tabuk, which was necessitated by the provocative
activities of the Christians living within or near the boundaries of
the Roman Empire to the north of Arabia. Accordingly, the Holy
Prophet, with an army of thirty thousand marched boldly towards the
Roman Empire but the Romans evaded the encounter. The result was that
the power of the Holy Prophet and Islam increased manifold and
deputations from all corners of Arabia began to wait upon him on his
return from Tabuk in order to offer their allegiance to Islam and
obedience to him. The Holy Quran has described this triumph in Surah
An-Nasr: &quot;When the succor of Allah came and victory was attained
and you saw people entering the fold of Islam in large numbers... </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<H2 STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Campaign
to Tabuk</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Campaign to Tabuk was the result of conflict with the Roman Empire,
that had started even before the conquest of Makkah. One of the
missions sent after the Treaty of Hudaibiyah to different parts of
Arabia visited the clans which lived in the northern areas adjacent
to Syria. The majority of these people were Christians, who were
under the influence of the Roman Empire. Contrary to all the
principles of the commonly accepted international law, they killed
fifteen members of the delegation near a place known as Zat-u-Talah
(or Zat-i-Itlah). Only Ka'ab bin Umair Ghifari, the head of the
delegation, succeeded in escaping and reporting the sad incident.
Besides this, Shurahbll bin Amr, the Christian governor of Busra, who
was directly under the Roman Caesar, had also put to death Haritli
bin Umair, the ambassador of the Holy Prophet, who had been sent to
him on a similar minion. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These
events convinced the Holy Prophet that a strong action should be
taken in order to make the territory adjacent to the Roman Empire
safe and secure for the Muslims. Accordingly, in the month of
Jamadi-ul-Ula A. H. 8, he sent an army of three thousand towards the
Syrian border. When this army reached near Ma'an, the Muslims learned
that Shurahbil was marching with an army of one hundred thousand to
fight-with them and that the Caesar, who himself was at Hims, had
sent another army consisting of one hundred thousand soldiers under
his brother Theodore. But in spite of such fearful news, the brave
small band of the Muslims marched on fearlessly and encountered the
big army of Shurahbil at M'utah. And the result of the encounter in
which the Muslims were fighting against fearful odds (the ratio of
the two armies was 1:33), as very favorable, for the enemy utterly
failed to defeat them. This proved very helpful for the propagation
of Islam. As a result, those Arabs who were living in a state of semi
independence in Syria and near Syria and the clans of Najd near Iraq,
who were under the influence of the Iranian Empire, turned towards
Islam and embraced it in thousands. For example, the people of Bani
Sulaim (whose chief was Abbas bin Mirdas Sulaimi), Ashja'a, Ghatafan,
Zubyan, Fazarah, etc., came into the fold of Islam at the same time.
Above all, Farvah bin 'Amral Juzami, who was the commander of the
Arab armies of the Roman Empire, embraced Islam during that time, and
underwent the trial of his Faith in a way that filled the whole
territory with wonder. When the Caesar came to know that Farvah had
embraced Islam, he ordered that he should be arrested and brought to
his court. Then the Caesar said to him, &quot;You will have to choose
one of the two things. Either give up your Islam and win your liberty
and your former rank, or remain a Muslim and face death.&quot; He
calmly chose Islam and sacrificed his life in the way of the Truth. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>No
wonder that such events as these made the Caesar realize the nature
of the danger that was threatening his Empire from Arabia.
Accordingly, in 9 A.H. he began to make military preparations to
avenge the insult he had suffered at M'utah. The Ghassanid and other
Arab chiefs also began to muster armies under him. When the Holy
Prophet, who always kept himself well-informed even of the minutest
things that could affect the Islamic Movement favorably or adversely,
came to know of these preparations, he at once under- stood their
meaning. Therefore, without the least hesitation he decided to fight
against the great power of the Caesar. He knew that the show of the
slightest weakness would result in the utter failure of the Movement
which was facing three great dangers at that time. First the dying
power of 'ignorance' that had almost been crushed in the battle-field
of Hunain might revive again. Secondly, the Hypocrites of Al:
Madinah, who were always on the look-out for such an opportunity,
might make full use of this to do the greatest possible harm to it.
For they had already made preparations for this and had, through a
monk called Abu Amir, sent secret messages of their evil designs to
the Christian king of Ghassan and the Caesar himself. Besides this,
they had also built a mosque near Al-Madinah for holding secret
meetings for this purpose. The third danger was of an attack by the
Caesar himself, who had already defeated Iran, the other great power
of that period, and filled with awe the adjacent territories. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
is obvious that if all these three elements had been given an
opportunity of taking a concerted action against the Muslims, Islam
would have lost the fight it had almost won. That is why in this case
the Holy Prophet made an open declaration for making preparations for
the Campaign against the Roman Empire, which was one of the two
greatest empires of the world of that period. The declaration was
made though all the apparent circumstances were against such a
decision: for there was famine in the country and the long awaited
crops were about to ripen: the burning heat of the scorching summer
season of Arabia was at, its height and there was not enough money
for preparations in general, and for equipment and conveyance in
particular. But in spite of these handicaps, when the Messenger of
Allah realized the urgency of the occasion, he took this step which
was to decide whether the Mission of the Truth was going to survive
or perish. The very fact that he made an open declaration for making
preparations for such a campaign to Syria against the Roman Empire
showed how important it was, for this was contrary to his previous
practice. Usually he took every precaution not to reveal beforehand
the direction to which he was going nor the name of the enemy whom he
was going to attack; nay, he did not move out of Al-Madinah even in
the direction of the campaign. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All
the parties in Arabia fully realized the grave consequences of this
critical decision. The remnants of the lovers of the old order of
'ignorance' were anxiously waiting for the result of the Campaign,
for they had pinned all their hopes on the defeat of Islam by the
Romans. The 'hypocrites' also considered it to be their last chance
of crushing the power of Islam by internal rebellion, if the Muslims
suffered a defeat in Syria. They had, therefore, made full use of the
Mosque built by them for hatching plots and had employed all their
devices to render the Campaign a failure. On the other side, the true
Believers also realized fully that the fate of the Movement for which
they had been exerting their utmost for the last 22 years was now
hanging in the balance. If they showed courage on that critical
occasion, the doors of the whole outer world would be thrown open for
the Movement to spread. But if they showed weakness or cowardice,
then all the work they had done in Arabia would -end in smoke. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>That
is why these lovers of Islam began to make enthusiastic preparations
for the Campaign. Everyone of them tried to surpass the other in
making contributions for the provision of equipment for it. Hadrat
Uthman and Hadrat Abdur Rehman bin Auf presented large sums of money
for this purpose. Hadrat Umar contributed half of the earnings of his
life and Hadrat Abu Bakr the entire earnings of his life. The
indigent Companions did not lag behind and presented whatever they
could earn by the sweat of their labor and the women parted with
their ornaments. Thousands of volunteers, who were filled with the
desire of sacrificing their lives for Islam, came to the Holy Prophet
and requested that arrangements for weapons and conveyance be made
for them so that they should join the expedition. Those who could not
be provided with these shed tears of sorrow; the scene was so
pathetic that it made the Holy Prophet sad because of his inability
to arm them. In short, the occasion became the touchstone for
discriminating a true believer from a hypocrite. For, to lag behind
in the Campaign meant that the very relationship of a person to Islam
was doubtful. Accordingly, whenever a person lagged behind during the
journey to Tabuk, the Holy Prophet, on being informed, would
spontaneously say, &quot;Leave him alone. If there be any good in
him, Allah will again join him with you, and if there be no good in
him, then thank Allah that He relieved you of his evil company&quot;.

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
short, the Holy Prophet marched out towards Syria in Rajab A. H. 9,
with thirty thousand fighters for the cause of Islam. The conditions
in which the expedition was undertaken may be judged from the fact
that the number of camels with them was so small that many of them
were obliged to walk on foot and to wait for their turns for several
had to ride at a time on each camel. To add to this, there was the
burning heat of the desert and the acute shortage of water. But they
were richly rewarded for their firm resolve and sincere adherence to
the cause and for their perseverance in the face of those great
difficulties and obstacles. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
they arrived at Tabuk, they learned that the Caesar and his allies
had withdrawn their troops from the frontier and there was no enemy
to fight with. Thus they won a moral victory that increased their
prestige manifold and, that too, without shedding a drop of blood. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this connection, it is pertinent to point out that the general
impression given by the historians of the campaigns of the Holy
Prophet about the Campaign of Tabuk is not correct. They relate the
event in a way as if the news of the mustering of the Roman armies
near the Arabian frontier was itself false. The fact is that the
Caesar had begun to muster his armies, but the Holy Prophet
forestalled him and arrived on the scene before he could make full
preparations for the invasion. Therefore, believing that &quot;discretion
is the better part of valor,&quot; he withdrew his armies from the
frontier. For he had not forgotten that the three thousand fighters
for the cause of Islam had rendered helpless his army one hundred
thousand strong at M'utah. He could not, therefore, even with an army
of two hundred thousand, dare to fight against an army of thirty
thousand, and that, too, under the leadership of the Holy Prophet
himself. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">When
the Holy Prophet found that the Caesar had withdrawn his forces from
the frontier, he considered thee question whether it would be
worthwhile to march into the Syrian territory or to halt at Tabuk and
turn his moral victory to political and strategical advantage. He
decided on the latter course and made a halt for twenty days at
Tabuk. During this time, he brought pressure on the small states that
lay between the Roman Empire and the Islamic State and were at that
time under the influence of the Romans, and subdued and made them the
tributaries of the Islamic State. For instance, some Christian chiefs

	has already been stated in the Preface to this Surah, this discourse
	(vv. 1-37) was revealed in A.H. 9, when Hadrat Abu Bakr had left for
	Makkah as leader of the pilgrims to the Ka`abah. Therefore the
	Companions said to the Holy Prophet, &quot;Sir, send it to Abu Bakr
	so that he may proclaim it on the occasion of Haj. &quot; He
	replied, &quot;The importance and nature of the Declaration demands
	that this should be proclaimed on my behalf by some one from my own
	family.&quot; Accordingly, he entrusted this duty to Hadrat 'Ali and
	instructed him to proclaim it openly before the pilgrims, and also
	make these four announcements: (1) &quot;No one who rejects Islam
	shall enter Paradise. (2) No mushrik should perform Haj after this.
	(3) It is forbidden to move round the Ka`abah in a naked state. (4)
	The terms of the treaties which are still in force (i.e. with those
	who have not broken their treaties with the Messenger of Allah up to
	that time) would be faithfully observed till the expiry of the term
	of the treaties&quot;.

	Islamic period after the conquest of Makkah was performed in A.H. 8,
	according to the old customs. Then in A.H. 9 the second Haj was
	performed by the Muslims in the Islamic way, and by the mushriks in
	their own way. But the third Haj, known as &quot;Hajja-tul-Wida a&quot;,
	was performed in A.H. 10 in the purely Islamic way under the
	guidance of the Holy Prophet himself. He did not perform Haj during
	the two previous years because up to that time the mushriks had not
	been forbidden from it, and so there were still some traces of shirk

	hatching plots against Islam in spice of the treaties of peace they
	had made. They would break the treaties and turn hostile on the
	first opportunity for treachery, and the same was true of all the
	mushrik clans with the exception of Bani Kananah, Bani Damrah and
	one or two other clans. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	proclamation practically reduced the mushriks of Arabia to the
	position of outlaws and no place of shelter was left for them, for
	the major part of the country had come under the sway of Islam. As
	this released the Muslims from the obligations of the treaties made
	with them and forestalled them, they were driven into a tight comer.
	For this smashed all their evil designs of creating trouble by
	inciting civil war at the time of a threat from the Roman and the
	Iranian Empires or after the death of the Holy Prophet. But Allah
	and His Messenger turned the tables on them before the opportune
	moment for which they were waiting. Now the only alternatives left
	with them were either to accept Islam that had become the state
	religion of Arabia, or to fight against it and be exterminated, or
	to emigrate from the country.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	wisdom of this grand plan became apparent when the mischief of
	apostasy broke out in different parts of Arabia a year and a half

	sudden and violent that it shook to its foundations, the newly
	created Islamic State, and would have done a far greater harm if the
	organized power of shirk had not been broken beforehand by this
	abrogation. It may be asserted that but for this timely action the
	mischief of apostasy, that rose at the very beginning of the
	Caliphate of Hadrat Abu Bakr, would have done ten-fold harm by
	rebellion and civil war, and might have changed the whole history of

	this passage the addressees are the Muslims. They have been urged to
	fight perseveringly in the Way of Allah, without paying the least
	heed to their ties of blood and relationship and to their worldly
	interests. In order to understand fully the spirit of this passage,
	the reader should keep in view the state of affairs at the time,
	when the abrogation of the treaties was declared. Though Islam was
	reigning supreme in the greater part of Arabia and there was no
	greater power to challenge its supremacy, still superficial
	observers saw a number of dangers in the extreme step which was
	being taken at that time. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, it
	was feared that the abrogating of the treaties with all the mushrik
	clans at one and the same time, and debarring them from Haj and
	changing the guardianship of the Ka`abah and abolishing all the
	rituals of `ignorance', would so incite the mushriks and the
	hypocrites and kindle such fire of enmity that they would be ready
	to shed the last drop of their blood for safeguarding their
	interests and prejudices. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	it was feared that the mushriks would be greatly enraged by this
	declaration which granted freedom of movement to the Muslims to
	perform Haj, whereas it forbade the non-Muslims. Obviously this
	would also affect adversely their economic condition, for Haj played
	a very important part in the economic life of Arabia during that
	period of her history. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Lastly,
	it was feared that this would put to a hard trial those people who
	had embraced Islam recently after the Peace Treaty of Hudaibiyah and
	the Conquest of Makkah. For many of their kith and kin were still
	mushriks, some of whom had their interests closely bound up with
	those offices of `ignorance' which were abolished. Now it was
	obvious that the total war against the mushriks demanded that these
	new Muslims should not only kill their own near and dear ones but
	should also themselves abolish those ancient offices and
	distinctions which they had enjoyed for centuries. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Though it
	is true that none of these dangers took any practical shape, there
	were good reasons for these apprehensions, for none could foresee
	the trends of events at the time of the abrogation of the treaties.
	And the dangers were averted because these Commandments had prepared
	them beforehand to meet them. More than that: this preparedness
	produced other good results. The delegates from the remnants of the
	mushriks, their chiefs and rulers began to visit Al-Madinah and take
	the oath of allegiance to Islam and obedience to the Holy prophet,
	who let them retain their old positions and offices. These things
	proved that if the Muslims had not been in a state of readiness to
	take immediate action for enforcing the terms of the &quot;Declaration&quot;
	with the sword, the events which followed might have taken a
	different direction. Therefore it was the need of the hour that the
	Muslims should have been vehemently urged for Jihad, and their
	apprehensions removed. That is why it was being enjoined that they
	should not let anything hinder them from doing the Will of Allah.
	And this is the theme of this discourse.&nbsp;

	this was to remove the misunderstandings of the Muslims who
	apprehended a bloody war as a result of the Declaration. They were
	told that it was also possible that some of the enemies might repent
	and embrace Islam. This was not made quite plain lest it should
	slacken the war preparations of the Muslims on one side and weaken
	the force of the warning to the mushriks on the other. The latter

	symbolical of the fact that they themselves agree to live in it as

	jizyah with their own hands,&quot; that is, &quot;with full consent
	so that they willingly become the subjects of the Believers, who

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">At first

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is
	jizyah &quot; of which the Muslims have been feeling apologetic
	during the last two centuries of their degeneration and there are
	still some people who continue to apologize for it. But the Way of
	Allah is straight and clear and does not stand in need of any
	apology to the rebels against Allah. Instead of offering apologies
	on behalf of Islam for the measure that guarantees security of life,
	property and faith to those who choose to live under its protection,
	the Muslims should feel proud of such a humane law as that of
	jizyah. For it is obvious that the maximum freedom that can be
	allowed to those who do not adopt the Way of Allah but choose to
	tread the ways of error is that they should be tolerated to lead the
	life they like. That is why the Islamic State offers them
	protection, if they agree to live as its Zimmis by paying jizyah,
	but it cannot allow that they should remain supreme rulers in any
	place and establish wrong ways and impose them on others. As this
	state of things inevitably produces chaos and disorder, it is the
	duty of the true Muslims to exert their utmost to bring to an end
	their wicked rule and bring them under a righteous order. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the question, &quot;What do the non-Muslims get in return
	for Jizyah &quot; it may suffice to say that it is the price of the
	freedom which the Islamic State allows them in following their
	erroneous ways, while living in the jurisdiction of Islam and
	enjoying its protection. The money thus collected is spent in
	maintaining the righteous administration that gives them the freedom
	and protects their rights. This also serves as a yearly reminder to
	them that they have been deprived of the honor of paying Zakat in
	the Way of Allah, and forced to pay jizyah instead as a price of
	following the ways of error.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other

	same season and they should be saved from the bother and
	inconvenience that are experienced by its observance according to
	the lunar year. In this way Haj was observed for 36 years on dates
	other than the actual dates. Then in the thirty seventh year it was
	again observed on the 9th and 10th of Zil-Hajjah, as they should
	have actually fallen according to the lunar calendar. It so happened
	that on the occasion when the Holy Prophet performed
	Hajja-tul-Wida'a (his Last Haj). these dates by rotation coincided
	with the actual dates of Haj according to the lunar calendar. So he
	declared during the course of his historic address at `Arafat: &quot;This
	year the dates of Haj have again occurred exactly at their natural

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">By making
	nasi unlawful and forbidding it, the Law declared that the two
	objects for which it was practiced were also sinful. First, they not
	only made lawful what Allah had made unlawful but also tried to
	practice deception on Allah by the seeming observance of the Law. As
	regards the second object of making the season of Haj fixed
	permanently according to the solar calendar, this too, was in fact
	the worst kind of rebellion against the Divine Law, although it
	appeared to be a harmless thing done for public good. But it
	defeated the very object of the Divine Law which prescribed the
	lunar calendar instead of the solar calendar for the observance of
	obligatory duties. Allah did this to ensure many good things for the
	Muslims, one of which is that His servants should be so trained as
	to obey His Commandments at all times of the year and under all
	circumstances. For instance, the month of Ramadan circulates among
	all the seasons of the year and the Muslims get used to obeying His
	Commandments whether it be summer or winter, dry or rainy season.
	This gives them that excellent moral training which is the real
	object of all the obligatory duties imposed by the Divine Law.
	Likewise, the dates of Haj according to the lunar calendar, fall
	during different seasons: therefore the servants of Allah have to
	travel during all the seasons, favorable and unfavorable. Thus they
	come out successful in the Divine test under all the circumstances
	and learn to be steadfast in their obedience.

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now it
	would have become quite clear why nasi was made unlawful and
	forbidden. It was designed to fix the season of Haj in order to suit
	their own conveniences though it defeated the Divine purpose of Haj
	and of the forbidden months. It meant that they had rebelled against
	Allah and become independent of Him; this is kufr. Besides this,
	Islam is a universal religion and for all human beings. It is
	obvious that the periods of fasting and performing Haj cannot
	satisfy all if they be fixed in accordance with the months of the
	solar year. For if they are performed in fixed months according to
	the solar year, the one and the same month will not equally suit all
	for the simple reason that it will fall during the same seasons in
	different places-summer or winter or very hot or very cold or rainy
	or dry or harvesting or sowing-year after year. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection it may also be kept in view that the proclamation about
	the prohibition of &quot;nasi &quot; was made on the occasion of Haj
	in A. H . 9 and next year,the Haj was performed on right dates which
	were in accordance with the lunar year. Since that time Haj is being

	efforts. As he does not depend on the material resources only, he is
	neither grieved if they are unfavorable, nor feels exultant when

	controller of all the resources; therefore he goes on doing his duty
	even under the most unfavorable circumstances with the same courage
	and perseverance that is shown by the worldly people unfavorable
	circumstances alone. That is why Allah asked the Holy Prophet to say
	to the hypocrites, &quot;There is a basic difference between you and
	us in regard to the conduct of affairs. We believe that both the
	good and the bad are from Allah: therefore the apparent result does
	not make us happy or sad. Moreover, we depend on Allah in our

	today!&quot; Suhail-bin-`Amr replied, &quot;It is no fault of `Umar
	but it is our own fault. When we were invited to Islam, we turned
	away from it, but these humble people accepted it and made
	sacrifices for it. &quot; Then both of them returned to the meeting
	and said &quot;Today we have noticed your treatment and we feel that
	it is all due to our own shortcomings, but tell us if there is a way
	for us to make atonements for our past failures&quot; . The Caliph

	was the condition of the hypocrites of Al-Madinah, the majority of
	whore were rich and old. We find from a list of the hypocrites,
	cited by Ibn Kathir in Al-Badayah-wan-Nihayah, that only one of them
	was young and none was poor. These people had large properties and
	flourishing businesses in Al Madinah. They were worldly-wise and
	their wide experience had taught them expediency, but their sense of
	self-interest had put them into a dilemma. When Islam reached
	Al-Madinah and a large majority of the population embraced it
	sincerely and enthusiastically, they found themselves in a very
	perplexing situation. They could not reject it outright for the
	majority of their own people, nay, their own sons and daughters,
	were filled with enthusiasm for Islam. If they had remained
	unbelievers, they would have lost their high position, their
	prestige and reputation and run the risk of a rebellion by the
	Muslims of their own household. On the other hand, if they sincerely
	embraced Islam, they would incur the danger of war, not only with
	the whole of Arabia but also with the adjoining nations and empires.
	Above all, self-interest had so blinded them that, in resolving the
	dilemma, they would not consider the problem from the point of view
	of truth and righteousness which by themselves are worthy of every
	sacrifice. Therefore they decided that the best thing for them was
	to profess Islam outwardly in order to make their positions,
	properties and businesses secure, but to adopt a hypocritical
	attitude towards it so that they might be able to avoid the losses
	and perils inherent in the sincere acceptance of Islam.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	verse (57) depicts the dilemma of the hypocrites, as if to say, &quot;In

	are Muslims like you; they profess Islam simply because they are
	afraid of losses they might incur, if they reject it outright. Then
	they dare not stay at AI-Madinah as non-Muslims for they would lose
	the high positions they enjoyed and might even have to cut off their
	connection with their wives and children; and if they decided to
	emigrate from AI-Madinah, they would have to abandon their
	properties and business. But they are not prepared for these
	sacrifices for they have no sincere attachment even to kufr.
	Therefore they are compelled against their beliefs by the force of
	circumstances to remain in AI-Madinah: they offer their Salat but
	regard this as forced labor: they pay the Zakat dues but as a
	penalty, for they are in their heart of hearts averse to these
	things. To add to their `calamities' they are asked every now and
	then to make sacrifices of their lives and their wealth and to go
	forth for Jihad and to fight with one enemy or the other. They are
	so much afraid of these `calamities' that, in order to escape from
	them, they would run in frantic haste to take refuge in any hole, if
	they hoped that it would provide immunity against these 'calamities'

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The

	came to Hadrat Abu Bakr and asked him to allot to them a certain
	piece of land. So he gave them a written order for this. They took
	it to some other highly placed Companions for further confirmation
	and some of them endorsed this order. But when they took it to
	Hadrat `Umar, he tore the paper into pieces before their very eyes,
	saying, &quot;It is true that the Holy Prophet used to give
	something to win over your hearts because Islam was weak at that
	time, but now Allah has made Islam so strong that it does not stand
	in need of people like you. &quot; At this they went to Hadrat Abu
	Bakr and complained to him about it and taunted him, saying, &quot;Are
	you the Caliph or `Umar?&quot; But he took no notice of this nor did
	any of the Companions differ with Hadrat `Umar's opinion. The
	Hanafis conclude from this incident that when the number and power
	of Muslims increased by the grace of Allah and they no longer stood
	in need of any support from such people; the reason for which
	expenses under this head were permitted in the first instance
	remained no longer there. Therefore the Companions unanimously
	abolished expenditure under this head. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Imam
	Shafi'i says that there is nothing to prove that the Holy Prophet
	ever spent anything out of Zakat Funds under this head. All the
	incidents mentioned in the traditions show that whatever he spent
	for the purpose of winning over hearts to Islam, was spent out of
	the spoils of war and not out of Zakat funds. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In my
	opinion there is nothing to show that the expenses for winning over
	hearts have been made unlawful for ever up to the Last Day. There is
	no doubt that the action taken by Hadrat `Umar was absolutely right,
	for if and when the Islamic State does not consider it necessary to
	spend anything under this head, Islam does not make it obligatory to
	spend something for `winning hearts'. On the other hand, if need for
	this arises at any time, it is authorized to incur expenses under
	this head for Allah has kept a provision for this. Hadrat `Umar and
	the other Companions agreed only on this that there was no need to
	give anything for this purpose at that time because the
	circumstances did not warrant it. But there is no reason to conclude
	from this that the Companions disallowed for ever the expenses that
	were permitted by the Qur'an under certain circumstances for the
	good of Islam.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the opinion of Imam Shafi`i, it appears to be correct in so
	far as it is not lawful to spend anything under this head out of
	Zakat Funds, if these expenses can be met out of other funds. But if
	it is necessitated that something should be spent under this head
	out of Zakat Funds, there is no reason why a differentiation should
	be made in this regard between sinful Muslims and unbelievers. For
	the Qur'an has not allocated the share because of the faith of the
	prospective recipients but because Islam required to win their
	hearts for its own good and because this could not be achieved
	except by giving them a portion of wealth. Therefore the Qur'an
	allows the Amir of the Believers to spend a part of the Zakat Funds
	to achieve this end, if, when and where the required conditions
	exist. The fact that the Holy Prophet did not spend anything from
	the Zakat Funds on unbelievers for this purpose does not mean that
	it is unlawful to do so, for he did not spend from this fund because
	there was enough money in other funds for this purpose. Had it been
	unlawful to spend anything from Zakat Funds on unbelievers, he would
	have explicitly forbidden it.&nbsp;

	contrast between the characteristics of the hypocrites (v. 67) and
	of the true Believers (v. 71) clearly shows that the two are
	entirely different from each other, in spite of their outwardly
	similar profession of faith in Islam and obedience to it. The
	difference lies in their morals, conducts, habits, attitudes and
	ways of thinking. On the one hand are the hypocrites whose tongues
	are never tired of professing faith in Islam, but who are void of
	sincere faith, and whose whole conduct belies their professions.
	They are, as it were, like bottles which have labels of &quot;musk&quot;,
	but contain cow-dung which may easily be recognized from its
	appearance and unpleasant odor. On the other hand are the true
	Believers, who are like those bottles which contain musk which may
	be tested in any way-by its appearance, its smell and other
	characteristics-to be musk. Likewise, though the outward label of
	Islam apparently makes both of them one community of Muslims, the
	real characteristics of the hypocritical Muslims are so different
	from those of the true Muslims that they have, in fact, become two
	different communities. The hypocritical Muslims, men and women, form
	a separate community with those who have similar characteristics.
	They all are neglectful of Allah, take interest in evil things and
	deviate from all that is good and never co-operate with tare
	Believers and, in short, they are allies to one another and
	practically dissociate themselves from true Believers and form a
	group of their own. In contrast to them, the true Believers, men and
	women, have practically become one community. All of them take
	interest in what is good, and abhor what is evil: they remember
	Allah day and night and cannot think of life without the constant
	remembrance of Allah; they are very generous in spending in the Way
	of Allah, and obey Him and His Messenger without any mental
	reservations. These common characteristics have dissociated them

	expedition to Tabuk.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote83">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote83sym" HREF="#sdfootnote83anc">82</A>This
	Command enunciated the change of policy towards the hypocrites. Up
	to this time, leniency was being shown to them for two reasons.
	First, the Muslims had not as yet become so powerful as to take the
	risk of an internal conflict in addition to the one with the
	external enemies. The other reason was to give trough respite to
	those people who were involved in doubts and suspicions so that they
	could get sufficient time for attaining to faith and belief. But now
	the time had come far a change of policy. The whole of Arabia had
	been subdued and a bitter conflict with the external enemies was
	about to start; therefore it was required that these internal
	enemies should be crushed down so that they should not be able to
	conspire with the external enemies to stir up any internal danger to
	the Muslims. And now it had become possible to crush them. As
	regards !he second reason, these hypocrites had been given respite
	for a period of nine years to observe, to consider and test the
	Right Way, and they could have availed of it, if they had any good
	in them. So there was no reason why any more leniency should be
	shown to them. Therefore, Allah enjoined the Muslims to treat the
	hypocrites on one and the same level with the disbelievers and start
	Jihad against them, and to give up the policy of leniency Grey had
	adopted towards them and adopt a fine and stern policy instead.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, it should also be noted that this verse does not enjoin
	the Muslims to fight with the hypocrites. It merely meant to end the
	policy of leniency that had hitherto been adopted towards them. This
	verse enjoined that they were no more to be considered a part and
	parcel of the Muslim community nor were they to be allowed to take
	part in the management of its affairs nor consulted about any
	matter, so that they might not be able to spread the poison of
	hypocrisy. This changed policy required that the true Believers
	should expose all those, who adopted a hypocritical attitude and
	conduct and showed in any way that they were not sincere allies to
	Allah, His Messenger and the true Muslims. Each and every one of
	such hypocrites should be openly criticized and reproved so that
	there should remain for them no more place of honor and trust in the
	Muslim society: they should be socially boycotted and kept away from
	the consultations of the Community: their evidence in the courts of
	law should be regarded as untrustworthy: the doors of offices and
	positrons of trust should be closed against them and they should be
	held in contempt in the social meetings. In short; every Muslim
	should show by his behavior to such a one that there was no place of
	honor or respect or trust for a hypocrite in the Muslim society.
	Besides this, if any one of them was found to be guilty of
	treachery, there should be no connivance at his crime, nor should he
	be pardoned but openly tried in a court of law and should be duly
	punished.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	Command was urgently needed at the time it came. It was obvious that
	in order to save the Muslim Community from fall and degradation, it
	was essential to purge it of all the internal dangers to its
	solidarity, because a Community, which nourishes hypocrites and
	traitors and allows the internal enemies to flourish with honor and
	security, wall inevitably be doomed to moral degradation and
	ultimate destruction. Hypocrisy is a plague and a hypocrite is the
	rat that carries and spreads its germs. Therefore to allow him the
	freedom of movement in the society is to expose the whole population
	to the danger of hypocrisy. Likewise, to give a place of honor and
	prestige to a hypocrite is to encourage many others in hypocrisy and
	treachery, for this shows that it is not sincerity, true faith and
	its welfare that count in it. One may flourish and prosper in it
	even if one verbally professes ;o be a Muslim and at the same time
	indulges in dishonesty and treachery. The Holy Prophet has expressed
	the same thing in a pithy saying. He said, &quot;Whoso honors and
	respects the inventor of new practices which are un-Islamic, indeed
	helps to demolish the very structure of Islam.&quot;&nbsp;

	which they had uttered. There are, however, traditions that mention
	several things of unbelief which were uttered by the hypocrites

	while he was talking to a young Muslim, a near relative of his,
	said, &quot;If all that this man (referring to the Holy Prophet) is

	the she-camels of the Holy Prophet went astray and the Muslims were
	moving about in search of it, a party of the hypocrites made a good

	is a reference to the plots which the hypocrites had made during the
	Tabuk expedition. On the return journey they conspired to pus!' the
	Holy Prophet down into some ravine, while he would be passing over
	some hill at night. The Holy Prophet got wind of the plot and
	ordered that the army should take the longer route through the
	valley round the hills, while he himself along with 'Ammar-bin-Yasir
	and Huzaifah-bin-Yaman would make the short-cut over the hi&quot; .
	While they were on the way, suddenly they discovered that a dozen of
	the hypocrites, with covered faces, were following them. At this
	Hadrat Huzaifah tented towards them so that he may drive away their
	camels but they were terrified when they saw him coming towards them
	and took to flight lest they should be recognized.</P>

	plot was to declare `Abdullah bin Ubayy as king at Al-Madinah as

	hypocrites of AI-Madinah. This refereed to the prosperity of
	Al-Madinah and its peoples, for Al-Madinah was a small town before
	the migration of the Holy Prophet to it, and its two clans-Aus and
	Khazraj-did not hold any high position in regard to wealth or
	prestige. But within the short period of nine years or so, this
	small town became the capital of Arabia because of the residence of
	the Holy Prophet and the sacrifices of the Ansar, the true Muslims.
	As a result of this, the former peasants-Aus and Khazraj of
	AI-Madinah became the `Great Ones' of the Islamic State and wealth
	began to flow into this central city on account of spoils of war and
	increased commercial activity. The hypocrites were rebuked in this
	verse that, instead of being grateful to the Holy Prophet, they

	that he had brought forth prosperity among them.

	him to give his shirt for his father's shroud. The Holy Prophet very
	generously granted his request. Then he begged the Holy Prophet to
	lead his father's funeral prayer. The Holy Prophet agreed to this

	to do so, saying, &quot;O Prophet of Allah! will you say funeral

	are sincerely and truly faithful to Allah and His Messenger. Without

	of a faithful servant or of a traitor and rebel. It is obvious that
	each and every case, in spite of apparent similarity, requires a
	separate and different judgment. For instance, let us take the case

	would have had to suffer it anyhow.&quot; On the contrary, the other

	&quot;Ah! what a bad luck! I have been attacked by this sudden
	disease at the time when I ought to have been in the battle-field
	instead of lying down here in bed!&quot; One of them made his
	illness not only an excuse for exemption from Jihad but also tried
	to dissuade others from it. On the contrary, the other one, though
	lying in the sick-bed, went on urging his own dear relatives,
	friends and others to go forth to Jihad; nay, he entreated even
	those who were attending him, saying, &quot;Leave me in the care of
	the Real Master, and go forth to Jihad. I am sure that the

	damaging war efforts and in disrupting the affairs of the families
	of the fighters. The other man in similar circumstances did his very
	best to make the home front as strong as he could. Though these two

	who actually took part in it, even though they could not join it in
	person and do anything practically for it. This is because they were
	sincerely grieved at their absence from Jihad for no fault of
	theirs, just as a man of the world would be grieved if he were
	deprived of some lucrative business or of some high profit. Allah
	considers such a one as on duty, because his heart was serving in
	the Way of Allah, though he had been deprived of active service on
	account of some genuine excuse. The Holy Prophet, while returning
	from Tabuk, stated the same thing like this: &quot;There are some
	people at Al-Madinah (at this time) who have been traveling and
	marching all along with you through every valley. Naturally the
	Companions to whom he was speaking were wonder struck at this. So
	they asked, &quot;While staying at Al-Madinah?&quot; He replied,
	&quot;Yes, while staying at AI-Madinah! This is because they were
	compelled by the circumstances to stay behind at AI-Madinah:
	otherwise they would certainly have accompanied you. &quot;

	has already been stated in E.N. 90, the &quot;Bedouins&quot; here
	refers to those rustic Arabs of the desert who had settled in the
	suburbs of Al-Madinah.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	background which may help one to comprehend the meanings of the
	verse is this. Though these people had outwardly embraced Islam,
	they had not done so from conviction. When they saw the rising of
	the organized power of Islam in Al-Madinah, they were so overawed by
	it that they could not ignore it. So at first they adopted the
	attitude of the opportunists towards the conflict between Islam and
	kufr. But when the power of the Islamic Government spread over the
	major portions of Hijaz and Najd, and the power of its enemy clans
	began to decline, they thought it expedient to enter the fold of
	Islam. But there were very few among them who had sincerely accepted
	Islam from the conviction that it was the Right Way. That is why
	they did not make any sincere efforts to fulfill the implications of
	the true Faith, and observe the obligatory duties imposed by Islam.
	On the contrary, the majority of them had accepted Islam just
	because it was the best policy for them. They merely desired to take
	advantages of being &quot;Muslims&quot; in order to gain those
	benefits to which they were entitled as members of the ruling party,
	without performing those duties which became obligatory on them by
	the very acceptance of Islam. Therefore they were utterly averse to
	saying the prescribed Prayers, observing the Fast, paying the Zakat
	dues from their date palm gardens and their herds of cattle.
	Moreover, they smarted under the discipline of the Islamic State and
	resented being subdued by any power for the first time in history.
	Above all, it was against their very nature to make sacrifices of
	their lives and wealth in the Way of Allah, as was being demanded by
	Islam, for they were accustomed to fight only for plunder and
	spoils. That is why they always invented one excuse or the other for
	exemption from the restrictions and obligations that were being
	imposed on them. For they had no interest in the Truth or the
	welfare of humanity; their only concern was their camels and their
	goats, that is, the narrow world around their tents. As regards
	anything higher than these, the only thing which they could believe
	in was irrational reverence for those who would guarantee their
	worldly welfare and protect them from calamities and give them
	amulets to safeguard them against haram and evil, and say prayers
	for them as a recompense for their offerings to them. Hut they were
	not prepared to accept any faith or belief that would bring under
	its moral and legal discipline every aspect of their cultural,
	social and economic life, and demand from them the sacrifices of
	lives and wealth for the cause of a universal reform.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	verse, the above-mentioned mental and moral condition of the
	Bedouins has been described like this: &quot;These Bedouins are more
	hypocritical than the urban Arabs and are more stubborn and obdurate
	in their denial of the Truth. This is because the urban people make
	use of the opportunities of meeting the learned and pious people and
	thus learn the laws and regulations of the Way. On the other hand,
	in all probability, the Bedouins will learn little about the Divine
	Way, because they get few opportunities for this. Moreover, they
	lead lives of &quot;economic animals&quot; rather than of human
	beings having moral and spiritual values; therefore they do not
	think of higher things than their animal urges.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It should
	also be noted that the main cause of the subsequent storm of

	years after the revelation of these verses (97-99) was the same that

	this passage a clear line of demarcation has been drawn between the
	hypocritical &quot;Muslims&quot; and the true Muslims, and
	instructions have been given regarding the treatment that should be
	meted out to the hypocrites. Therefore, the one who claims to be a
	Muslim but dots not sincerely devote himself to Allah, His Way and
	the Islamic Community, should be severely dealt with, if there is a
	clear proof, from his conduct, that he lacks sincerity; or if he
	offers anything in the Way of Allah, it should be rejected
	forthwith: or when he dies the Muslims should neither join his
	funeral prayer nor beg God's pardon for him, even though he be one's
	father or brother. In contrast to this, if a believer is guilty of
	some sin and confesses it, he should be pardoned, and his offerings
	should be accepted and prayers should be said for his forgiveness.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the criterion by which it will be judged whether one is or
	is not a hypocrite, though one might have been guilty of an act of
	insincerity, three things have been implied in this passage:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) A
	sincere follower will openly and clearly confess his sin without
	offering any lame excuses and giving false explanations and
	interpretations of his offense. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) It
	will be judged from his previous conduct whether he was a habitual
	offender or he committed the sin on the spur of the moment because
	of some weakness. If he had been behaving like a righteous Muslim
	and if his record showed sincere services, sacrifices and good deeds
	to his credit, it will be reasonably concluded that he was not a
	hypocrite. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) His
	future conduct will be watched to see whether his confession was
	verbal or there had really been a change of heart. If he sincerely
	feels sorry for his sin and is anxious to compensate for it and his
	whole conduct shows that he intends to eradicate the root cause of
	the weakness in his Faith that misled him into the sin, it will be
	concluded that he sincerely feels sorry for his sin and that he was
	not a hypocrite but a sinful believer. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The event
	that is connected with the occasion on which this passage was sent
	down, makes this subject quite clear. It is related by the scholars
	of Traditions that these verses were revealed in regard to Abu
	Lubabah bin `Abdul Manzar and his Companions. Hadrat Abu Lubabah was
	one of those people who had embraced Islam on the occasion of the
	Oath of Allegiance at `Aqabah before the migration of the Holy
	Prophet to Al-Madinah. He had taken part in the battles of Badr, Uhd
	and other campaigns. But on the occasion of the Tabuk Expedition, he
	succumbed to some inner weakness and stayed at home without any
	genuine and lawful excuse. The same was the case of the other six
	Companions, who were sincere Muslims. When the Holy Prophet returned
	from Tabuk and they came to know that Allah and His Messenger had a
	very bad opinion of those who had stayed behind, they were filled
	with shame and regret. Therefore they tied themselves to a pillar
	even before they were called upon to explain their conduct. Then
	they declared, &quot;We will neither eat anything nor sleep unless
	we are pardoned or die in the same condition.&quot; After some days
	they fell down in an unconscious condition because of hunger and
	sleeplessness. When at last they were informed that Allah and His
	Messenger had pardoned them, they went to see the Holy Prophet and
	said, `Sir, we request you to accept from us as propitiatory
	offerings our houses and the whole of our possessions. As these were
	responsible for our sin of omission, we desire to give them away in
	the Way of Allah. &quot;But the Holy Prophet replied, &quot;There is
	no need to give the whole of your property for only one-third of it
	will suffice.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A deep
	consideration of this event clearly brings out the kind of
	weaknesses that are pardonable. All of these people were not
	habitual offenders and defaulters. Their whole past conduct showed
	that they were sincere Muslims: none of them invented false
	explanations to excuse themselves but confessed their sin. By
	offering the whole of their properties as. propitiatory offerings,
	they proved that they were really sorry for their conduct and wanted
	to atone for their sin. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, another important lesson should also be learned from
	these verses. In order to atone for one's sins, one should give a
	practical proof along with the verbal confession and heartfelt
	regret. One way of this is to give charity in the Way of Allah for
	this helps to cleanse the filth which was being nourished in the
	heart and which was responsible for the sin. This not only
	eradicates the hidden evil but also increases the capacity for good
	works. For the confession of one's sin is like the feeling of one
	who has fallen into a pit. He at once realizes that he is in a
	critical situation in a pit, where he does not like to abide, and is
	troubled over it. Therefore he thinks out plans for getting out of
	it and makes practical efforts for this. Likewise the one who
	confesses his sin and feels ashamed of it and takes practical steps
	to atone for it by making offerings and doing other good works,
	intends to come out of the pit of sin.</P>

	then you shall return to Allah ....&quot; Who is the ultimate judge
	of everything and from Whom nothing can be concealed. Therefore even
	if one succeeds in hiding one's hypocrisy in this world or is judged
	to be up to the standard in one's Faith and sincerity, it does not
	mean in any way that such a one will succeed in escaping
	chastisement for hypocrisy in the Hereafter also.</P>

	. . the one in conflict . . . Messenger&quot; was Abu `Amir who
	belonged to the clan of Aus of Al-Madinah. He had become Christian
	monk during the period of `ignorance' before the migration of the
	Holy Prophet and was well-known as a scholar of the Scriptures and
	was held in great reverence as a pious monk. But his scholarship and
	asceticism, instead of leading him to the Truth, became hindrance in
	the way. That was why he not only rejected Islam but also became a
	bitter enemy of the Holy Prophet and his Mission, for he took the
	Prophet for a rival in the &quot;holy business&quot; of priesthood.
	At first he ignored the Holy Prophet and his Mission in the hope
	that the power of the Quraish would suffice to crush him and his
	Mission. But when the Quraish suffered an utter defeat in the battle
	of Badr, he could no longer ignore it, so he started a vigorous
	vicious campaign against the Islamic Movement. Accordingly he left
	Al-Madinah and visited . different clans, in order to incite them
	against Islam, and was one of those who brought about the battle of
	Uhd. It is said that he had got some pits dug in the battle-field of
	Uhd, and that the Holy Prophet fell into one of these and received
	injuries. Then he played an important role in organizing the armies
	which came to invade Al-Madinah in the battle of Ahzab. Likewise
	this Christian Monk took a very active part in giving support to the
	mushriks against Islam in all the subsequent battles up to the
	battle of Hunain, At last when he realized that no power in Arabia
	could withstand the onslaught of Islam. he left Arabia and went to
	the Roman Caesar in order to warn him of the rising &quot;danger&quot;
	from AI-Madinah. It was because of his efforts that the Caesar began
	to make preparations for invading Arabia, to counteract which the
	Holy Prophet went forth on the expedition to Tabuk.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the background of the building of the `mosque' that was
	built to harm the Righteous Mission. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A section
	of the hypocrites of AI-Madinah collaborated wholeheartedly with Abu
	`Amir in all the above-mentioned hostile activities against Islam.
	They also fully agreed with him that he should use his &quot;spiritual&quot;
	influence to obtain military help from the Roman Caesar and the
	Christian states of northern Arabia. Accordingly, when he was
	preparing to go to the Roman Caesar to urge him to invade Arabia.
	they devised a plan of making a `mosque' of their own to serve as a
	safe meeting place for organizing themselves into a separate party
	because none would suspect that they were carrying on evil
	activities under the garb of religion. Moreover. this `mosque' would
	serve as an ambush for the agents of Abu `Amir who could stay in it
	as travelers and mendicants without raising any suspicion that they
	were spies of the enemy.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As there
	were already two mosques in Al-Madinah-one at Quba and the other,
	Masjid-i-Nabavi, in the city obviously there was no need for a third
	one. The hypocrite's themselves understood this: therefore they
	began to invent &quot;reasons&quot; to show that there was really a
	need for a third mosque. Accordingly, they went to the Holy Prophet
	and said, &quot;We need another `mosque' because it is very
	difficult for the people of this area, especially the old, the sick
	and the disabled, to offer the five prescribed Prayers in either of
	the two Mosques, during the winter season and the rainfall.
	Therefore we intend to build a new `mosque' only for the convenience
	of those who live at a distance from the two Mosques but are
	desirous of saying their prayers in congregation.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">With such
	professedly pure motives, these mischief makers built the 'mosque'
	and then went to the Holy Prophet with the request, &quot;Sir,
	please stand in this new 'mosque' and lead the congregation in one
	of the prescribed prayers so as to perform its opening ceremony.&quot;
	But the Holy Prophet postponed the matter, saying, &quot;At this
	time I am wholly engaged in making preparations for the expedition
	to Tabuk. I shall consider the matter on my return home. &quot;
	After this he went forth to Tabuk, and they started their nefarious
	activities. They went on organizing themselves and conspiring
	against Islam in the `mosque' and decided to crown
	Abdullah-bin-Ubayy as their king, as soon as the Muslims would meet
	with reverses and be utterly crushed down by the Romans, as they had
	expected. But their expectations were all frustrated by what
	happened at Tabuk. Then on the revelation of these verses during the
	return journey at a place, Zi Avan, near AI-Madinah, the Holy
	Prophet dispatched some men to demolish the mosque' before his entry
	into the city.&nbsp;

	applies to the brink of that piece of land which has been undermined
	by a river or a stream, leaving its surface without any support. In
	this meaningful simile the construction of the structure of life on
	the Godless foundations has been compared to that building which is
	built on the river brink, which has been undermined by its water. It
	is obvious that the ignorant man who builds a structure on the

	land, will not only lose the building but will also lose his own
	life, for it will inevitably fall down into the river along with him

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote107sym" HREF="#sdfootnote107anc">106</A>In
	this verse that aspect of the Islamic Faith which determines the
	nature of the relationship between Allah and His servants has been
	called a transaction. This means that Faith is not merely a
	metaphysical conception but is, in fact, a contract by which the
	servant sells his life and possessions to Allah and in return for
	this accepts His promise that He would give him the Garden in the
	Life-after-death. In order to comprehend the full implications of
	this transaction, let us first understand its nature. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">We should
	note it well at the outset that, in reality, this transaction is not
	in regard to the actual selling of the life and possessions of the
	servant to Allah in the literal sense, for Allah is in fact the real
	Owner of man's life and possessions. Allah alone has the right o
	ownership because He is the Creator of man and of everything he
	possesses and uses. Therefore there is no question at all of selling
	and buying in the worldly sense; for man possesses nothing of his
	own to sell, and Allah has no need to buy anything because
	everything already belongs to Him. However, there is one thing which
	has entirely been entrusted to man by Allah, that is, the freedom of
	will and the freedom of choice, and the transaction concerns that
	thing.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Of
	course, it is true that this freedom does not make any change in the
	real position of man with regard to the right of ownership to his
	own life and his possessions. They belong to Allah Who has delegated
	to him only the authority to use or abuse these things as he wills,
	without any coercion or compulsion from Him. This means that man has
	been given the freedom to acknowledge or not to acknowledge that
	Allah is the owner of his life and property. The transaction
	mentioned in v. 111 is concerning the voluntary surrender of this
	freedom to Allah's Will. In other words, Allah wills to test man
	whether he acknowledges the ownership of Allah over his life and
	property, in spite of that freedom, and considers himself to be
	their trustee only, or behaves as if he were their owner and so
	could do whatever he liked with them.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus, the
	terms of this transaction from Allah's side arc these: &quot;If you
	voluntarily (and not by compulsion or coercion) agree to acknowledge
	that your life, your property and everything in this world, which in
	fact belong to Me, are Mine, and consider yourself only as their
	trustee, and voluntarily surrender the freedom I have given you to
	behave, if you so like, in a dishonest way and yourself become their
	master and owner, I will give you, in return, Gardens in the eternal
	life of the Next World&quot;. The one who makes this bargain with
	Allah is a Believer, for Faith is in fact the other name for making
	this bargain. On the other hand, the one who refuses to make this
	bargain, or after making it adopts the attitude of the one who has
	not made the bargain, is a kafir for, technically, kufr is the term
	applied to the refusal to make this bargain.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The

	has put man to two very hard tests in this matter. The first is
	whether he acknowledges the real Owner as owner, in spite of the
	freedom of choice given to him, or he refuses this and becomes
	ungrateful, treacherous and rebellious. The second test is whether
	he puts his trust in his God or not, and surrenders his freedom and
	sacrifices his desires and wishes in this present world in return
	for His promise of the Gardens and eternal bliss in the Next World,
	even though the world were to proclaim: &quot;A bird in hand is
	worth two in the bush&quot;.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) This
	matter helps to draw a clear line of demarcation between the legal
	conception of the Islamic Faith and the higher and spiritual one
	according to which Allah will judge one in the Hereafter.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to its legal conception, the mere verbal profession of the articles
	of the Faith is a sufficient proof that one is legally a Muslim and
	after this no Jurist is authorized to declare such a one to be a
	disbeliever or to expel one from the fold of the Islamic Community,
	unless there is a definite and clear proof that the one made a false
	profession of the Faith. But this is not so with Allah: Allah
	considers the Faith of only that person to be true, who makes this
	bargain with Him and sells his freedom of thought and action to Him
	and gives up his entire claim to ownership in His favor. That is why
	a man might profess the articles of the Faith and observe the
	prescribed obligatory duties, but if he considered himself alone to
	be the master and owner of his body and soul, his heart and brain
	and his other faculties, his property and his resources and other
	things in his possession, and reserved to himself the right of
	expending them as he willed, he shall be regarded a disbeliever in
	the sight of Allah, even though he should be regarded a believer in
	the sight of the world. This is because such a man has not made that
	bargain with God which is the essence of the Faith according to the
	Qur'an. The very fact that a man does not expend his life and
	property in the way Allah approves of, or expends these in the way
	He disapproves, shows that the one who claimed to profess the Faith
	either did not sell these to Allah or after having made the
	transaction still regarded himself to be their master and owner.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	above conception of the Islamic Faith draws a clear line of
	demarcation between the attitude of a Muslim and that of a
	disbeliever towards life. The Muslim, who sincerely believes in
	Allah, surrenders himself completely to Allah's Will, and does
	nothing whatsoever which may show that he is independent in his
	attitude, except when he temporarily forgets the terms of the
	bargain he has made with Him. Likewise no community of the Muslims
	can collectively adopt an independent attitude in political,
	cultural, economic, social and international matters and still
	remain Muslim. And if sometimes it temporarily forgets its
	subordinate position and its voluntary surrender of its freedom, it
	will give up the attitude of independence and readopt the attitude
	of surrender, as soon as it becomes aware of its error. In contrast
	to this, if one adopts the attitude of independence towards Allah
	and makes decisions about all the affairs of life in accordance with
	ones own wishes, whims and caprices, one shall be regarded to have
	adopted the attitude of disbelief, even though one was a `Muslim' or
	a non-Muslim.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) It
	should also be noted well that the Will of God to which a man is
	required to surrender himself is that which is specified by Allah
	Himself and not the one which the man himself declares to be the
	will of God. For in the latter case one does not' follow God's Will
	but one's own will, which is utterly against the terms of the
	transaction. Only that person (or community) who adopts the attitude
	that conforms to the teachings of His Book and His Messenger, shall
	be deemed to have fulfilled the terms of the transaction.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From the
	above implications of this transaction, it also becomes clear why
	the fulfillment of the terms by Allah has been deferred to the Next
	World after the termination of the life of this world. It is obvious
	that the Garden is not the return for the mere profession that the
	buyer has sold his life and property to Allah &quot;but it is the
	actual surrender of these things in the worldly life and their
	disposal by him as a trustee of Allah according to His Will.&quot;
	Thus, this transaction will be completed only when the life of the
	buyer comes to an end in this world and it is proved that after
	making the bargain, he went on fulfilling the terms of the agreement
	up to his last breath. For then and then alone, he will be entitled
	to the recompense in accordance with the terms of the transaction.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It will
	also be worthwhile to understand the context in which this matter
	has been placed here. In the preceding passage, there was the
	mention of those people who failed in the test of their Faith and
	did not make the sacrifice of their time, money, life and interests
	for the sake of Allah and His Way, in spite of their professions,
	because of their negligence or lack of sincerity or absolute
	hypocrisy. Therefore after criticizing the attitudes of different
	persons and sections, they have been told in clear words the
	implications of the Faith they had accepted: &quot;This is not the
	mere verbal profession that there is God and He is One, but the
	acceptance of the fact that He is the Owner and the Master of your
	lives and possessions. Therefore, if you are not ready and willing
	to sacrifice these in obedience to the Command of Allah, but expend
	these and your energies and resources against the Will of Allah, it
	is a clear proof that you were false in your profession of the
	Faith. For the true Believers are those who have truly sold their
	persons and possessions to Allah, and consider Him to be their Owner
	and Master, and expend their energies and possessions without any
	reservations, where He commands them to expend, and do not expend
	the least of these where He forbids them to expend.&quot;</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote108sym" HREF="#sdfootnote108anc">107</A>Some
	critics say that the statement &quot;this promise is contained in
	the Torah and the Gospel&quot; is not confirmed by these Books.
	Their objection in regard to the Gospel is obviously wrong for even
	in the existing Gospels there are sayings of Prophet Jesus that
	confirm this verse. For instance:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Blessed
	are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is
	the kingdom of heaven.&quot; (MAT. 5: 10).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;He
	that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for
	my sake shall find it.&quot; (MAT. 10: 39). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;And

	life.&quot; (MAT. 19: 29). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is,
	however, true that the matter of this transaction is not confirmed
	in its entirety by the existing Torah. For instance, there is a
	mention of the first part of the bargain at several places in one
	forth or the other: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">. . .is
	not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and
	established thee?&quot; (DEUT. 32: 6). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Hear,
	O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord: And thou shalt love the Lord
	thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
	thy might. &quot; (DEUT. 6: 4-5). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But as
	regards the other part of the bargain, that is, the promise of the
	Gardens, they applied it to the land of Palestine: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Hear
	therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with
	thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the Lord God of thy
	fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and
	honey.&quot; (DEUT. 6: 3). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is
	because the Torah does not give any conception of the
	Life-after-death, the Day of Judgment, Rewards and Punishments in
	the Here-after, though this creed has always been an inseparable
	part of the Right Way. This does not, however, mean that the Torah
	did not originally contain this creed. The fact is that the Jews had
	become so materialistic during the period of their degeneration that
	they had no other idea of a reward from God than the well-being and
	prosperity in this world. Therefore they perverted all the promises
	made by God in return for man's service and obedience to Him and
	applied those to the land of Palestine. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, it should also be noted that the above-mentioned changes
	became possible because the original Torah had been tampered with in
	several ways. Some portions were taken away from it and others were
	added to it. Thus, the Torah in the existing form is not purely the
	Word of God but also contains the comments, etc. , of the Jewish
	scholars mixed up with it. So much so that at some places it becomes
	difficult to distinguish the Word of God from the Jewish traditions,
	their racial prejudices, their superstitions, their ambitions and
	,wishes, their legal interpretations, etc., all of which have got
	mixed with the Word of God. (For further details please see E.N. 2
	of Al-i-Imran).</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote109">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote109sym" HREF="#sdfootnote109anc">108</A>The
	Arabic word (atta-i-bun) literally means &quot;those who repent&quot;
	. But in the context it occurs it implies &quot;those who possess
	repentance as their permanent characteristic&quot;, that is, they
	repent over and over again. Moreover, the literal meaning of
	(taubah) is &quot;to turn to&quot; or &quot;to turn back&quot; .
	Therefore its explanatory translation will be &quot;....those who
	turn back to Allah over and over again&quot; . This is the first and
	foremost characteristic of a true Believer because even a true
	Believer is liable to forget the bargain he makes with Allah by
	which he sells his life and property to Him. As this matter does not
	concern his sense organs but pertains to his mind and heart, he is
	liable to forget that these things are not really his property but
	they belong to Allah. Therefore, even the true believer occasionally
	forgets the bargain, and behaves in a way as if he were their owner.
	But as soon as he becomes conscious of this transitory lapse and
	realizes that he had violated the terms of his agreement, he feels
	sorry and ashamed of his conduct and turns to his God, begs His
	pardon and renews the terms of the bargain with Him, and pledges his
	allegiance to Him after every slip of its violation. This kind of
	repentance alone is the guarantee that one will always come back to
	one's Faith: otherwise it is not possible for man because of the
	inherent human weaknesses, to observe strictly and deliberately the
	terms of the bargain without ever falling a prey to negligence and
	error. That is why Allah says in praise of the true Believer that
	&quot;.....he turns back to Allah over and over again&quot; and not
	that &quot;he never slips into error after making the bargain of
	obedience and service to Him&quot; . And this is the greatest
	excellence that man can accomplish. Let us now consider the wisdom
	of placing this characteristics first in the list of the
	characteristics of the true Believers. It is to admonish those who
	had been guilty of crimes after the profession of their Faith, They
	have been told in v. III that the true Believers are those who sell
	their lives and property to Allah. After this they are being told
	that if they sincerely intend to become true Believers they should
	first of all create in themselves this characteristic and at once
	turn to Allah without showing any obduracy so that they should not
	deviate further into error.</P>

	does not behoove . . . to pray for the mushriks . . . &quot; implies
	two things. First, we love them and sympathize with them. Secondly,

	cherish these things for the one who is loyal, though a sinner, but
	it is absolutely wrong in principle to love and sympathize with a
	person who is an open rebel and to consider his case as pardonable
	as it renders our own loyalty doubtful. Besides, it adds to the
	intensity of the crime, if we pray for the forgiveness of a mushrik,
	who is our near relative. For it means that we consider our
	relationships to be more valuable than the fulfillment of the
	implications of our loyalty to Allah and that our love with Allah.
	and His Way is not wholly unalloyed and that we desire that Allah
	should also be influenced by the love we have with His rebels and
	pardon our criminal kinsmen, even though He should throw the other
	criminals into the fire of Hell. Obviously, all such things are
	wrong and are against loyalty and sincerity and the Faith demands
	that our love with Allah and His Way should be absolutely unalloyed
	and that His friend should be our friend and His enemy our enemy.
	That is why Allah has not said, &quot;Do not pray for the
	forgiveness of the mushriks &quot;, but has instead warned, It does
	not behoove the Prophet and those who have believed to pray for the
	forgiveness of the mushriks&quot;, which implies this: &quot;The

	one's own relatives, of showing love, sympathy and kindness, and
	cherishing fellow-feelings with them it is not forbidden at all but

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The story
	of the above-mentioned boycott has been described in detail by Ka`ab
	bin Malik, who was one of the Three. When he became old and blind,
	he himself told his story to his son, ' Abdullah, who used to
	accompany him everywhere. As this story is an excellent lesson for
	all, it is given below in Ka`ab's own words:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;When
	the Holy Prophet urged upon the people to get ready for Jihad, I
	made up my mind to make preparations for this. But when I went home,
	I became negligent, saying to myself, `There is .no hurry: when the
	time comes I will readily make preparations and start forthwith'. In
	this way I went on putting off my preparations till the time came
	when the army was going to start on the Expedition. As I had made no
	preparations for the journey, I said to myself, `It does not matter:
	1 will be able to join the army in a couple of days during the
	journey' . But again the same negligence prevented me from putting
	my intention into practice. At last no occasion was left for me to
	join the army. To add to my misery my conscience pricked me over and
	over again that the people with whom I had stayed behind in
	AI-Madinah were either the hypocrites or those Muslims who were old
	or otherwise unfit for Jihad.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;When
	the Holy Prophet came back from Tabuk, he, as usual, said two
	rak'ats of prayer in the Mosque. Then he sat there to meet the
	people. At first, the hypocrites, whose number was a little more
	than eighty, came to him and offered lathe excuses on solemn oaths.
	The Holy Prophet listened to the false story of each of them and
	accepted their apparent excuses and left the decision about their
	hearts to Allah, saying, `May Allah forgive you' . Then it was my
	turn to put forward my excuse. I went forward and uttered my
	salutations. He smiled and said, `Well, what kept you behind?' (I
	hesitated for a moment.) By God, I would have invented one excuse or
	the other to satisfy any man of the world, for I am well versed in
	the art of conversation. But here was the Holy Prophet who was
	demanding an explanation from me. I believed that even if I
	succeeded in satisfying him by making a false excuse, Allah will
	inform him of the truth of the case and I shall again incur his
	displeasure. On the other hand, if I told the truth, I expected that
	Allah would forgive me, even though I were to incur his displeasure
	for the time being. So I replied, `Sir, I have no excuse for staying
	behind. I was in every way able to go forth (to Tabuk)' . At this
	the Holy Prophet remarked, `This is the man who has told the truth'.
	Then turning to me, he said, `Go and wait till Allah decides your
	case' 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;I
	rose from there and took my seat among the people of my own clan.
	They at once began to tease and reprove me because I had made no
	excuse. At this, I was tempted to go and make some false excuse. But
	when I came to know that there were also two good people (Murarah
	bin Rubai and Hilal bin Umayyah), who had told the same thing that I
	had, I felt satisfied and stuck to the truth. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;After
	this the Holy Prophet issued a general order that no one should have
	any kind of talk with us. The other two confined themselves to their
	houses but I used to go out of my house and say my prayers in
	congregation and walk through the bazaars. As nobody spoke to me, it
	appeared to me that I was a foreigner in some strange city where I
	had no acquaintances. When I attended the mosque, I would utter the
	usual salutations and wait in vain for a response from the Holy
	Prophet. I would turn stealthy looks at him to read his thoughts in
	regard to me, but he would turn his eyes away from me, though he had
	been looking at me while I was engaged in prayer. As this condition
	became intolerable for me, one day I went to see Abu Qatadah who was
	a cousin of mine and a friend from childhood. I climbed over the
	wall of his garden and uttered my salutations, but even he did not
	make any response to it. Then I said, `O Abu Qatadah ! I ask you to
	tell me on oath whether I love or do not love Allah and His
	Messenger' . But he remained silent. Again I repeated the question
	but he kept silent. I asked him on oath to answer my question. Then
	he merely replied, `Allah and His Messenger know best' . At this my
	eyes were filled with tears, and I came back. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Another
	incident happened during, those days. Once I was passing through the
	bazaar, when a Syrian came to me and gave me a letter wrapped in
	silk. This was from the king of Ghassan and read like this: `We have
	come to know that your Leader is persecuting you these days. As you
	are not an ignoble person, we will not leave you to rot there.
	Therefore come to us and we will honor you (as you deserve)' I said
	to myself, `Here is another hard trial for me' . Then I threw the
	letter into the burning oven. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	boycott continued for forty days, when a man brought this message
	from the Holy Prophet that I should separate from my wife. I asked
	whether I should divorce her but was told that I should only
	separate from her. Accordingly I said to my wife, 'Go to your
	parental home and wait till a decision comes from Allah. ' 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;On
	the fiftieth day, when after the morning prayers, I was sitting in a
	state of utter despair on the top of my house, all of a sudden some
	one cried aloud, `O Ka`ab bin Malik! Please accept my
	congratulations.' Hearing this, I fell prostrate to the ground
	before Allah, for I understood that the Command of my forgiveness
	had come After this, people began to pour in, each trying to
	forestall the other in congratulating me on the acceptance of my
	repentance. I rose and went directly to the Mosque. I noticed that
	the face of the Holy Prophet was glowing with happiness and in
	response to my salutations, he said, `I congratulate you on this: it
	is the best day of your life.' I said, `Is this forgiveness from you
	or from Allah?' He replied, `It is from Allah.' Then he recited
	these verses (117-118). I asked, `O Messenger of Allah! Does my
	repentance require that I should give the whole of my property in
	charity?' He replied, `Keep a part of it, for it will be better for
	you.' Accordingly, I kept my property at Khaibar for myself and gave
	all the rest in charity. Then I solemnly pledged that I would stick
	to the truth throughout the rest of my life, for Allah had forgiven
	me in return for the truth I had told. That is why I have never
	uttered a word against reality intentionally up to this time and
	hope and expect that Allah will protect me from lies in future as
	well. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	story contains many lessons, and every Believer should impress these
	on his mind and heart. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The first
	and foremost lesson we learn from this story is that the matter of
	the conflict between Islam and kufr is so important and delicate
	that we should take the greatest possible care to be on our guard in
	regard to this. Not to mention the case of one who takes active part
	on the side of kufr, if a Muslim shows the least negligence even
	inadvertently in taking part on the side of Islam once in his life;
	and that, too, not with any evil intention, he is liable to lose all
	the lifelong services and devotions rendered by him in the cause of
	Islam. That was why such a severe action was taken even against
	those worthy people who had done great deeds of valor in the battles
	of Badr, Uhd, Ahzab and Hunain, and whose sincerity and Faith were
	absolutely above suspicion. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second thing, which is as important as the first, is that one should
	never consider lightly any negligence in the performance of a duty,
	for this often misleads one to commit an offense that is counted
	among heinous sins. The fact that ore did not commit the offense
	with any evil intention cannot save one from punishment. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Lastly,
	this story presents the true spirit of the society that had been
	evolved out under the leadership of the Holy Prophet. On the one
	side there were the hypocrites whose treacherous deeds were quite
	well known to all. They offered lame excuses which were accepted
	without demur for nothing better could be expected from them. On the
	other side, let us take the case of Ka`ab bin Malik, who was a tried
	Believer, and whose sacrifices were above every kind of suspicion.
	He did not invent any false story to justify himself but confessed
	his fault quite plainly and clearly. But in contrast to the
	hypocrites, a severe chastisement was inflicted on him, not because
	there was any suspicion about his Faith but because a sincere
	Believer like him had behaved in a way in which only a hypocrite
	could behave. Thus the chastisement was meant to remind them: &quot;You
	are the salt of the earth. But if you, too, become tasteless, from
	where will then salt be obtained?&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is
	another noteworthy side of the matter. The part played by the Leader
	and the Follower and the Muslim Society in this incident is unique.
	The Leader inflicts the most severe punishment but with the feelings
	of affection and without any tinge of anger or hatred in it. It is
	like the punishment which a father gives to his son, It is always
	understood that the punishment is given for the good of the son, who
	knows that as soon as he mends his ways, he will regain the fatherly
	love. And the Follower sets an excellent example of obedience under
	very trying circumstances. He suffers hard from the severity of the
	chastisement but never thinks of rebelling against the Leader
	because of any false personal or clannish pride; nay, he does not
	cherish in his heart any complaint against his beloved Leader, but
	begins to love him even more than before. During this saddest period
	of his life the only thing he yearns for is a look of affection from
	his Leader. For he is like a famine-stricken farmer whose only hope
	is the piece of cloud which he sees floating in the sky. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us have a glimpse of the Muslim society, which displayed the
	greatest discipline and the highest moral spirit that had ever been
	shown by any society. No sooner does the Leader order the boycott
	than the whole community becomes a stranger to the follower not only
	in public but also in private. So much so that his nearest relatives
	and closest friends do not even speak to him; nay, his own wife
	leaves him alone. He implores them on oath to tell him if they
	suspected his sincerity, but even his lifelong companions make a
	point-blank refusal, saying that he should ask Allah and His
	Messenger for that testimony. But in spite of the show of this
	strict discipline, the moral spirit of the community is so high and
	so pure that not a single person tries to take advantage of the
	position of the fallen brother by adding insult to his injury; nay,
	every one feels sorry for his brother in disgrace, and is important
	to embrace him as soon as he is forgiven. That is why the people run
	in haste to tell him the good news. to build. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The above
	is the model of the Righteous community that the Qur'an aims 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	background makes it plain why Allah not only forgave them but also
	manifested His Kindness; Gentleness and Compassion in His
	Forgiveness to these people. It was because of their sincerity which
	they proved during the fifty days of their chastisement. Had they
	shown arrogance after the commission of their offense and retaliated
	by taking angry and hostile actions as does every self-worshiper
	whose pride is wounded: had they behaved during their boycott in a
	manner as if they would break away from the community but never bow
	down before it: had they passed this period in spreading
	dissatisfaction in the community and gathering around them all the
	disgruntled people in order to organize a strong &quot;opposition&quot;
	against the Leader, then they would have most certainly been
	expelled from the community, as if to say, &quot;Go you now and
	worship the idol of your self, for henceforth you will never be
	given any opportunity for exerting to raise the Word of Allah&quot;.
	But these Three did not adopt this way though it was open to them.
	On the contrary, they took a different way, as has been seen, and
	proved that God-worship had destroyed every idol that might have
	remained hidden in their hearts: that they had dedicated themselves
	entirely to the exertion in the Way of Allah: that while joining the
	Islamic community they had burnt their boats to make it impossible
	for themselves to go back anywhere: that they would put up with
	every kind of treatment but would remain in the community and die as
	a member of it and would scornfully reject any offer of an honorable
	place outside it; and would rather bear disgrace in it. That was why
	they were again taken in the community with the same honor as
	before. This is the explanation of the kind words of forgiveness:
	&quot;Allah turned to them with kindness so that they should turn to
	Him.&quot; In these concise words, the Qur'an has depicted the true
	picture of the matter. The Master had at first turned away His
	attention from His Three servants but when He saw that they had not
	left His door but had remained there with broken hearts, He again
	turned to them in appreciation of their fidelity so as to bring them
	back into the fold.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote121sym" HREF="#sdfootnote121anc">120</A>In
	order to comprehend the meaning of this verse, v. 97 with which it
	is connected, should be kept in view: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;These
	Bedouins are most stubborn in unbelief and hypocrisy, and, in all
	probability, will remain ignorant of the laws of the Way which Allah
	has sent down to His Messenger.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In v. 97,
	the Qur'an merely diagnosed the disease and pointed out its
	symptoms. The Bedouins were suffering from the disease of hypocrisy
	because of their ignorance of the laws of the Way of Allah. This was
	so because they had not had any connections with the Center of that
	knowledge. Here in this concluding portion of the Surah, the remedy
	of that disease has been prescribed so that they should have an
	understanding of Islam and its implications. It is not necessary
	that for this purpose all of them should leave their homes and come
	to AI-Madinah to learn that knowledge, but some of them should come
	from each habitation, clan and region to the Centers of the
	Knowledge (AI-Madinah, Makkah and the like) and understand Islam.
	Then they should go back to their own habitations and create its
	understanding among the common people.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This was
	a very important instruction that was given at the opportune moment
	to strengthen the Islamic Movement for, at that time, the people
	were entering into the fold of Islam in large numbers without its
	proper understanding. Obviously, this instruction was not needed in
	the initial stages of the Movement, for at that tune everyone who
	embraced Islam did so with its full understanding. No one would
	think of becoming a Muslim without this as this was an invitation to
	persecution. When the Movement became successful and won power in
	the land, the clans and the habitations began to enter en bloc into
	the fold of Islam. Naturally very few of them understood the full
	implications of the Faith before accepting it, but the majority of
	them were being carried into the fold, as it were, by the strong
	current that had been generated by the Movement. Outwardly this
	immense increase in numbers appeared to be a source of strength to
	Islam, but in reality such people as had no true understanding of
	Islam and were, therefore, not prepared to fulfill its moral
	obligations, were not only useless for the Islamic System but were
	actually harmful to it. This side of the matter became quite
	apparent during the preparations for the Tabuk expedition. That is
	why Allah sent down the instruction that necessary steps should be
	taken for the integration of the Islamic Community so that it may
	keep pace with the immense increase in its number. Therefore some
	people should be brought out from every habitation and taught and
	trained in the requirements of Islam and these in their turn should
	teach and train their own people so that the whole Muslim population
	should understand Islam and obtain the knowledge of the limits
	prescribed by Allah.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, it should also be clearly understood that the Command
	about mass education given in this verse is not merely about
	literacy but it had the definite aim of imparting the understanding
	of the Way of Islam among the masses and enabling them to refrain
	from un-Islamic Ways. This is the real and permanent aim of
	education that has been set before the Muslims by Allah Himself.
	Therefore every system of their education shall be judged by this
	criterion and shall be regarded Islamic only to the extent it
	fulfills this aim. It does not, however, mean that Islam is against
	the spreading of literacy and teaching of the purely mundane
	subjects to the masses, but it simply means that the primary aim of
	the Islamic Education should be the achievement of the objective
	which has been mentioned above in italics. Without this, it does not
	consider any education to be education at all, even if it were to
	produce Einsteins and Freuds of the age. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It will
	be worthwhile to consider the true significance of the words used in
	the context, for they created a strange misunderstanding among the
	people of the later period, and produced lasting poisonous effects
	on the religious education of the Muslims, nay, on their whole
	religious life in general. It is obvious that Allah used these words
	in order to lay down the objective of education before the Muslims,
	which was this: to understand the Islamic Way of life and have an
	insight into its system: to be familiar with its true nature and
	spirit so as to be able to judge and differentiate between the
	Islamic and the un-Islamic ways of thought and conduct in every
	aspect of life. But later on when the knowledge of the Muslim Law
	was given the technical name of (fiqh), it gradually developed into
	the science of the details of external form (as opposed to the
	spiritual aspect of the Islamic Law). As the word (fiqh) is of the
	same root as used in this verse, a misunderstanding was created that
	this Command of the Qur'an was about acquiring the knowledge of fiqh
	in the above-mentioned sense. It is true that this knowledge is of
	great importance in the Islamic System of life, but it is not all
	that is required by the Qur'an but only a part of the objective. It
	is not possible to recount here all the damages that the Muslim
	Community has suffered because of this misunderstanding, but suffice
	it to say that this is the thing, which is responsible for reducing
	the religious education of the Muslims to the knowledge and
	interpretation of the external form of Islam without paying any
	attention to the spirit of Islam. This inevitably resulted in making
	lifeless formalism the ultimate goal of the life of the Muslims.&nbsp;

	the apparent wording of this verse, it may be inferred that only
	those Muslims have at first been held responsible to fight with
	those enemies of Islam who live near their territory. But if we read
	this verse along with the succeeding passage, it becomes clear that
	here &quot;disbelievers who are near you refers to those hypocrites
	who were doing great harm to to Islamic Society by mixing up with
	the sincere Muslims. This very thing was stated in v. 73 at the
	beginning of this discourse. The Command has been repeated at its
	end in order to impress on the Muslims the importance of the matter
	and to urge them to do Jihad and crush these internal enemies,
	without paying the Least regard to the racial, family and social
	relations that had been proving a binding force with them. The only
	difference between the two Commands is that in v. 73, the Muslims
	were asked to do Jihad with them, while in this verse stronger
	words, &quot;fight with them&quot; , have been used, which were
	meant to impress on them that they should crush the hypocrites
	thoroughly and completely. Another difference in the wordings is
	that in v. 73, two different words, &quot;disbelievers and
	hypocrites&quot;, have been used, while in this verse only one word,
