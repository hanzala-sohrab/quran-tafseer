<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Surah takes its name from V. 98, in which there is a reference to
Prophet Yunus (Jonah). The name, as usual, is symbolical and does not
indicate that the Surah deals with the story of Prophet Jonah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We
learn from traditions, and this is supported by the contents of the
Surah itself, that the whole of this Surah was revealed at Makkah.
But there are some people who are of the opinion, that some of its
verses were revealed at Al-Madinah. This is, however, a superficial
view. The continuity of the theme clearly shows that this does not
comprise isolated verses or discourses that were revealed at
different times and on different occasions. On the contrary, it is,
from the beginning to the end, a closely connected discourse which
must have been revealed at one sitting. Besides this, the nature of
its theme is itself a clear proof that the Surah belongs to the
Makkan period. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We
have no tradition in regard to the time of it's revelation, but its
subject matter gives clear indication that it must have been revealed
during the last stage of the Holy Prophet's residence at Makkah. For
the mode of the discourse suggests that at the time of its
revelation, the antagonism of the opponents of the Message had become
so intense that they could not tolerate even the presence of the Holy
Prophet and his followers among themselves, and that things had come
to such a pass as to leave no hope that they would ever understand
and accept the Message of the Prophet. This indicates that the last
stage of the Prophet's life among thee people had come, and the final
warning like the one in this Surah had to be given. These
characteristics of the discourse are clear proof that it was revealed
during the last stage of the Movement at Makkah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;The
people consider it a strange thing that this Message is being
conveyed by a human being and charge him with sorcery, whereas there
is nothing strange in it nor has it any connection with sorcery or
sooth saying. It simply informs you of two realities. First, Allah,
Who has created the universe and manages it, is, in fact, your Master
and Lord, and He alone is entitled to your worship. The second
reality is that after the life in this world, there will be another
life in the Next World, where you shall have to render full account
of the life of this world and be rewarded or punished according to
whether you adopted the righteous attitude as required by Him after
acknowledging Him as your Masters or acted against His will. Both of
these realities, which the Messenger is presenting before you, are
&quot;realities&quot; in themselves whether you acknowledge them as
such or not. He is inviting you to accept these and regulate your
lives in accordance with them; if you accept these, you will have a
very blessed end; otherwise join shall meet with evil consequences.&quot;

Had Allah<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote15anc" HREF="#sdfootnote15sym"><SUP>15</SUP></A>
hastened in dealing out evil to people as they hastened in asking
good of the world, the term allowed to them for action would have
been terminated long before this. (But this is not Our Way:) We let
wander in their rebellion those people who do not expect to meet Us.
Strange is the behavior of man! When he is in affliction, he calls
Us, standing or sitting or lying down, but when We remove his
.affliction from him, he behaves as if he had never called Us at the
time when affliction came upon him. Thus the evil deeds of such
transgressors have been made seeming fair to them. O mankind, We
destroyed before you those communities<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote16anc" HREF="#sdfootnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
(which were in power in their time,) when they adopted the attitude
of transgression,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote17anc" HREF="#sdfootnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
for their Messengers came to them with clear signs but they would not
believe in them. This is how We recompense the criminals for their
crimes. Now We have appointed you in their place on the earth so that
We may test how you conduct yourselves.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote18anc" HREF="#sdfootnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

This is how people behave: No sooner do We show mercy to them after
some calamity had afflicted them than they begin to practice
deceptions<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote29anc" HREF="#sdfootnote29sym"><SUP>29</SUP></A>
concerning Our Signs. Say to them, &quot;Allah is more swift in His
plans than you: indeed His angels are keeping a full record of your
acts of deception.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote30anc" HREF="#sdfootnote30sym"><SUP>30</SUP></A>
It is Allah Who enables you to travel over land and by sea. So you
set sails in ships, rejoicing over a fair breeze. Then all of a
sudden a strong wind begins to rage against the passengers and
billows begin to surge upon them from every side and they realize
that they have been encircled by the tempest. At that time they pray
to Allah with sincere faith, saying, &quot;If You deliver us from
this peril, we will become Your grateful servants.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote31anc" HREF="#sdfootnote31sym"><SUP>31</SUP></A>
But when He delivers them, the same people begin to rebel in the land
against the Truth. O people, this rebellion of yours is harmful only
to yourselves. (You may enjoy) the transitory pleasures of this
world, then you have to return to Us: then We will let you know what
you have been doing. This worldly life (which has so enamored you
that you have become neglectful of Our Signs) may be likened to the
produce of the earth: We sent rain-water from the sky, and the crops
of which man and animals eat, grew up luxuriantly. Then at that very
time, when the land was at its best, and the crops had ripened and
decked out and the owners were presuming that they would be able to
benefit from them, Our Command came all of a sudden by night or by
day, and We destroyed it so thoroughly as though nothing had existed
there the previous day.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote32anc" HREF="#sdfootnote32sym" SDFIXED><SUP>31a</SUP></A>
Thus We expound Our Signs in detail for the consideration of those
people who are thoughtful. (You are being deluded by this transitory
life,) and Allah invites you to the Abode of Peace.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote33anc" HREF="#sdfootnote33sym"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
(Guidance is in His power,) and He guides to the Right Way whomsoever
He pleases. Those who have done excellent works will get excellent
rewards, and even more than their merits:<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote34anc" HREF="#sdfootnote34sym"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
neither gloom nor disgrace shall cover their faces. They deserve the
Garden, where they will abide for ever. And those who have earned
evil deeds shall have their recompense according to the evil they
earned:<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote35anc" HREF="#sdfootnote35sym"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
disgrace shall set over them: there shall be none to protect them
from Allah: their faces shall be covered with such gloom<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote36anc" HREF="#sdfootnote36sym"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
as if the black veils of the night had fallen over them: they deserve
Hell, wherein they shall abide for ever. On the Day We will muster
them together (in Our Court,) We will say to those who committed
shirk, &quot;Stay where you are, you and those whom you set as
partners with Us.&quot; Then We will remove the state of strangeness
from among them,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote37anc" HREF="#sdfootnote37sym"><SUP>36</SUP></A>

us.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

is the remedy for the diseases of the heart, and guidance and
blessing for those who believe in it. O Prophet, say, &quot;It is the
bounty of Allah and His mercy that He has sent this thing: let the

We rescued those of them, who were with him in the Ark and made them
successors on the earth and drowned those who rejected Our
Revelations. So consider the end of those who were warned (but did
not believe). After Noah We sent different Messengers to their

	mere fact that he was moving the hearts and influencing the minds of
	the believers with his eloquence, was not a sufficient proof that he
	was using magic to achieve this object. And it is not difficult at
	all to distinguish rhetoric of a Messenger from that of an enchanter
	for these are quite distinct from each other in their nature, in the
	objectives for which they are used and in the effect they produce on
	the lives of the believers. The irresponsible &quot;enchanter&quot;
	does not care at all whether what he utters is correct, just and
	righteous because his only object is to influence the hearts of the
	hearers in order to achieve his own unlawful ends. That is why he
	does not hesitate at all to utter any false, exaggerated or unjust
	thing, if it serves his purpose. For his only aim is to produce an
	emotional effect in order to deceive the people by using an
	artificially ornamented and exaggerated language rather than to
	state things of wisdom. As a result of this, his talk is
	contradictory, imbalanced and unsystematic. As his sole object is
	self-interest, he abuses his rhetoric for exploitation, or for
	sowing seeds of discord or for setting one party against the other.
	Therefore, the &quot;enchanter&quot; fails to produce any high moral
	effects on the lives of the people or to imbue them with any
	righteous thoughts or to urge them to noble deeds or to bring about
	any healthy change in their lives; nay, as a result of his &quot;magic&quot;

	witnessing that the talk of 'this person' is wise, systematic,
	balanced, right and just. Every word he utters is well-thought out
	and everything he says is most valuable and precious. His eloquence
	aims at nothing but reform of the people. There is not the least
	tinge of personal, family, national or any other worldly interest in
	his talk. His only intention and desire is to warn the people of the
	consequences of their negligence and to invite them to the way of
	their own good. Then consider the effects of his eloquence and you
	will find that they are quite different from those produced by the
	rhetoric of the `enchanters'. The lives of all those who have been
	influenced by him have been so reformed that they have become models
	of high moral character and excellent conduct. Therefore, you should

	and justice demand that those who believe and do righteous deeds

	reject the Truth and do evil deeds, should be duly punished. As

	is the third argument in proof of the doctrine of the life in the
	Hereafter. It is based on Allah's manifestations in the heavens and
	on the earth. The greatest and most manifest of these are the sun,
	the moon and the alternation of the night and day, for these are
	ever present before each and every human being. All these clearly
	show that the Creator of this great and vast universe is not a child
	who has made all this for mere fun and will break it up when he is
	satiated with it. These manifestations of His are a clear proof of
	the fact that the Creator is All-Wise, for there is a system, a
	wisdom, a design and a serious object in each and every particle of
	His creation. These seem, as it were, to say. &quot;When you
	yourselves learn from the signs and manifestations of His wisdom
	that He is All Wise, how can you, then, expect that He will not call
	man to account after granting him common-sense, moral feelings,
	independent responsibility and authority to exploit His endless
	resources, and that He will not reward those who make the right use
	of these and punish those who abuse them?&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus, it
	has become obvious that in vv. 4-6, three arguments have been given
	in their logical order to present the doctrine of the Hereafter: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	fact of the origination of life in this world is a proof that life
	in the Next World is also possible. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) There
	must be life in the Hereafter, because it is essential for the
	recompense of the deeds that one does, and of the use or abuse one
	makes of the moral responsibilities that have been entrusted to man.
	Therefore, it is the demand of common-sense and justice that there
	must be another world in which one should bear the consequences of
	one's deeds, for this is not possible in this world. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) When
	common-sense and justice demand that there must be life in the
	Hereafter, this need will surely be satisfied, for the Creator of
	man and the universe is All-Wise, and it cannot be conceived that
	the All-Wise will not satisfy the demands of common-sense and
	justice. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A deep
	thinking will show that these are the only possible arguments for
	the proof of the life in the Hereafter and these suffice, too. After
	this the only thing that might be demanded in this connection is
	that it should be actually demonstrated before man to convince him
	that this thing is possible, necessary and demanded by the Wisdom of
	Allah. But it is obvious that this will not be done in this world
	for this is for the trial of man and not for recompense, and Allah
	wills to test whether man believes in the Hereafter without seeing
	it, merely by his reasoning on the right lines. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides
	this, the words, &quot;He makes His Signs manifest for those people,
	who possess knowledge&quot; and &quot;...in all that Allah has
	created... there are Signs for those, who intend avoiding (deviation
	from the Truth)&quot; are worthy of serious consideration. These
	words imply this: &quot;Allah has in His wisdom spread such signs in
	each and every manifestation of His as clearly point to the
	realities that are hidden behind them; but only those people can
	reach to those realities, who (a) free themselves from the
	prejudices of ignorance and acquire knowledge from the sources with
	which Allah has provided man for this purpose, and (b) have the
	intention of avoiding wrong ways and following the Right Way.&quot;

</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote12">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote12sym" HREF="#sdfootnote12anc">12</A>This
	passage also contains both a statement and its proof. The statement
	is that those who reject the doctrine of the Hereafter shall
	inevitably go to Hell and its proof is that those who reject or pay
	no heed to this, commit such evil deeds as deserve nothing less than
	the fire of Hell. The fact which is supported by the experience of
	thousands of years, is that those who do not consider themselves
	responsible and accountable to God in the Hereafter, go astray into
	wrong ways for lack of any control over themselves, and commit
	immoralities and fill God's earth with tyranny, chaos and filth and
	thus merit Hell. This is inevitable. If a man leads his life on the
	presumption that there is no other life, he will have no fear that
	he shall have to render a full account of all his deeds in this
	world. Therefore his sole aim in this life will be to win, by hook
	or by crook, prosperity, happiness, fame and power in this world.
	Naturally these materialistic attitudes make people heedless of the
	Signs of Allah and mislead them into wrong ways that lead to Hell. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The above
	argument for the doctrine of the Hereafter is in its nature
	different from the previous three arguments. This is based on the
	knowledge gained by human experience while the former were based on
	rational reasoning. Though here only a hint has been given about it,
	the same has been stated in detail in other places in the Qur'an.
	This is the argument in brief. Human beings cannot adopt
	individually or collectively the right attitude towards life unless
	the doctrine of accountability to God is deeply embedded in their
	hearts. The fact that human beings begin to behave erroneously, if
	and when their belief in this doctrine disappears or becomes weak,
	is borne out by a long experience. Had not the creed of the
	Hereafter been real, its acceptance or rejection would not have
	produced the results inevitably and continuously for centuries. The
	fact that the acceptance of a doctrine should have continuously
	produced right sort of results, and its denial wrong results, is a
	clear proof that it is real. Though the premises of the above
	argument and the conclusion drawn from these arc clear and closely
	connected, there arc some people who do not agree with this
	proposition. They argue their point like this. There are many
	instances of people who deny the Hereafter and base their moral
	philosophy and their rule of conduct on atheism and materialism:
	still they possess high moral characters and abstain from every sort
	of evil; in short, they are virtuous in their affairs and render
	great services to the people. But a little thinking will show that
	this is a weak argument. If we probe into the materialistic
	philosophies and systems, we shall find that all these lack solid
	foundations for the moral excellence and practical virtuous deeds;
	therefore they cannot produce those qualities with which the
	atheists and the materialists are credited. Indeed no such
	motivating factors exist in those philosophies as may produce the
	qualities of righteousness, honesty, trust-worthiness, justice,
	compassion, generosity, sacrifice, sympathy, self-control, purity,
	the fulfillment of duties, obligations and pledges and the like. The
	only alternative to the doctrines of Tauhid and the Hereafter is
	&quot;utilitarianism&quot; which might become the basis for a
	practical moral system, for all the other philosophies are merely
	hypothetical and impracticable. It is quite obvious that the
	motivating power of utilitarianism is very limited because it is
	incapable of carrying a person farther than &quot;utility&quot;
	itself. Therefore the one who believes in this doctrine will
	consider a virtue a &quot;virtue&quot; only as long as it is useful
	to his own person, family, society etc., and will direct all his
	efforts towards promoting their welfare and happiness and will
	adhere to moral qualities only as long as they are conducive to his
	own good or to that of his own people. But he will discard these
	&quot;virtues&quot;, when he is convinced that these will be
	harmful. That is why a utilitarian does not believe in absolute
	morality but adopts truth or falsehood, honesty or dishonesty,
	faithfulness or treachery, justice or injustice, in short, any
	virtue or vice that may suit the occasion and be useful for his own
	interests. The English people are the most appropriate example of
	utilitarian morality. Their example will serve our purpose as they
	are cited by its supporters to prove their proposition that one may
	possess a high moral character even though one were to deny the
	existence of God and the Hereafter for, they say, the English people
	in general are more truthful, more honest, more just and more
	trust-worthy than others though they arc materialists; whereas the
	fact is that the English people provide the most appropriate
	practical proof of the instability of utilitarian character. Is it
	not a fact that the representatives of the English nation make a
	very poor show of their morality in regard to international affairs?
	They tell brazen-faced lies and are guilty of treachery, tyranny,
	injustice and dishonesty, and the whole nation backs them up as its
	champions. Had their morality been founded on sound basis, it could
	not have been possible that as individuals they should be truthful,
	honest, just, righteous and observe pledges, but as a nation they
	would discard all these moral values. This is a clear proof that
	these people do not believe in moral values as such but only if
	these are useful for their self-interest: otherwise they could not
	have adopted two contradictory positions as individuals and as a
	nation. Morality is morality only if it is absolute, otherwise it is
	a policy and expediency. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Nevertheless,
	if there be any up-holders of absolute morality from among the
	disbelievers of Allah and the Hereafter, they could not have got
	these virtues from the doctrine of utilitarianism but from those
	latent religious influences that might have remained embedded in

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) Why
	will they be given Gardens of bliss in the life of the Hereafter?
	This will be because they followed the Right Way in the life of this

	</P>

	did they obtain at every step, at every turning and at every
	crossroad the correct criterion of judging between the right and the
	wrong, the true and the false, the righteous and the erroneous? Then
	from where did they get the power to remain stead-fast on the Right
	Way, avoiding scrupulously wrong ways, after getting the right sort
	of discernment? It was their Lord Who is the real source of
	everything, Who gave them the guidance and the power of doing good
	works on every critical occasion. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) Why
	did their Lord give them that guidance and power? He gave them these
	things because of their Faith. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) What
	is that characteristic of the Faith which produces the above results
	? The Faith which produces those results does not comprise mere
	profession but it is that Faith which becomes the moving spirit of
	one's conduct and character and has the power of reforming one's
	morals and deeds. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In order
	to illustrate this point, let us consider, in the physical life of
	man, the case of food that is consumed for nourishment, health,
	energy and happiness. It is obvious that these results cannot be
	produced by the mere taking in of any food, but by that &quot;food&quot;
	which is so digested as turns into blood and circulates into every
	vein to provide energy to every part of the body for its proper
	functioning. In the same way, in the moral life, guidance, righteous
	attitude and pure conduct and true success, depend on those right
	creeds that get deeply embedded in the mind, heart and soul.
	Otherwise, creeds which are merely professed by the tongue or lie
	dormant in some corner of the mind and the heart, cannot produce
	such results, for they cannot influence one's conduct, character,
	way of thinking and attitude towards life for the better. Just as
	one may eat food and still not obtain those useful results which arc
	produced only if it is digested properly according to the physical
	laws of God, in the same way, one who professes those right creeds
	merely with his tongue, but does not make them a part of his mind,
	heart and soul, does not deserve those rewards which are only for
	those whose deeds correspond to the creeds.</P>

	the introductory verses (1-10), the Qur'an takes up admonition which
	is the main subject of the Surah. In order to understand this fully
	we should keep two things in view as its background: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, a
	little before its revelation, the continuous horrible famine, which
	Had afflicted Makkah for seven long years and humbled the haughty
	Quraish, had come to an end. Naturally this had given a blow to
	idol-worship and acted as a stimulus to God-worship: for in their
	utter helplessness, they had to supplicate to Allah and cry meekly
	for help. So much so that Abu Sufyan had to approach the Holy
	Prophet with this request: &quot;Please pray to Allah to remove this
	affliction from us. But when the famine was over, and rains began to
	fall, and prosperity returned, they began to show rebellion and do
	evil deeds and started their hostile activities against the
	believers. Thus the hearts that had fumed to Allah, again became
	neglectful of Him. (See XVI: 113, XXIII: 75-77, XLIV: 10-16). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	the Qur'an answered the question with which they confronted the Holy
	Prophet whenever he warned them of the consequences of rejecting the
	Truth. They would say, &quot;You are always threatening us with
	Allah's wrath; why doesn't the Divine torment visit us and why is it
	being delayed?&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Keeping
	the above background in view, vv. 11-12 may be expanded like this:
	&quot;Allah does not hasten in punishing and seizing the people for
	their sins as He hastens in showing kindness and compassion to them.
	Do they, then, want Him to hasten His torment for their rebellions,
	as He hastened to remove famine in answer to their supplications? As
	this is not Our Way, We give them time to mend their evil ways in
	spite of their transgressions and rebellions. We send warning after
	warning and give them respite until their term comes to an end. Then
	the law of requital comes into force. In contrast to this, their way
	is the way of mean and narrow-minded people. When affliction comes,
	they remember Allah, begin to cry and call Him meekly, but forget it
	all during the time of prosperity. Such bad ways as these are
	leading them to Divine torment.&quot; &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote21sym" HREF="#sdfootnote21anc">21</A>This
	is a very strong argument against their accusation that Muhammad
	(Allah's peace be upon him) was himself the author of the Qur'an but
	was ascribing it to Allah, and in support of the Holy Prophet's
	claim that it was being sent down to him by Allah, Who was its
	Author. The argument is this: &quot;You yourselves have witnessed
	the forty years of his life before his appointment to Prophethood.
	He was born in yow own city and passed his boyhood, youth and middle
	age before yow very eyes. He lived among you and had all kinds of
	relations-social, marital, economic, etc. with you. So much so that
	no aspect of his life was hidden from you. Did you notice anything
	in his whole life that might show that he could be the author of
	this Book? Do you not use your commonsense?&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	question posed in the Qur'an implied two things which were well
	known to everyone in Makkah about the Holy Prophet: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	during the forty years of his life before Prophethood, he had
	neither received any education nor training nor sat in any company
	that should have enabled him to become the author of such a Book as
	was full of unique things that were unknown to the people around
	him. No one had ever heard from him anything about the problems that
	had been dealt with in different Surahs of the Qur'an. So much so
	that not even a relative or close friend of his had ever noticed
	anything in his talk or in anything about him that might have shown
	any signs of gradual development towards it, before he made his
	great claim to Prophethood when he reached the age of forty. This
	was a clear proof of the fact that the Qur'an was not the invention
	of his own brain and that it must have been sent down to him from
	outside. For it is impossible for a human being to produce anything
	like this, all of a sudden and without ever manifesting any signs of
	its evolution and development in his earlier life. That is why when
	some intelligent people of Makkah felt the absurdity of this
	accusation, they began to say that it was some other person who
	taught these things to him. But this was even more absurd than the
	first thing because they could not point out specifically a single
	person in the whole of Arabia, not to say of Makkah, who had the
	ability of producing such unique things as were contained in the
	Qur'an. They also knew that a person of his high caliber could not
	have remained obscure in some unknown corner for forty years. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second thing, that had distinguished him during those forty years of
	his life, was his noble character both from the negative and from
	the positive aspects. He was never known to have told a single lie
	or practiced any kind of deceit, forgery, cunning, craftiness and
	the like in any way whatsoever, On the other hand, all those people
	with whom he had come into contact in any capacity bore witness to
	the fact that he had been truthful, honest, and trustworthy without
	any blemish whatsoever. As an instance, a most well-known historical
	fact may be cited. Only five years before his Prophethood, the
	Ka`abah was damaged by rains. When they were re-building it, a
	quarrel arose among the different clans of the Quraish as to who
	should have the honor of setting Hajr-I-Aswad (the Black Stone) in
	its proper place. Therefore it was agreed that the one who would be
	the first to enter into the Haram next morning should arbitrate in
	the quarrel. Next morning the first person who entered the Haram was
	Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him). At this all the people cried
	out with joy, &quot;He is an absolutely trust- worthy man, and we
	are fully satisfied with him; he is Muhammad. &quot; This is how
	Allah had made that large gathering of the Quraish bear witness to
	the fact that he was &quot;The Trustworthy&quot;, before appointing
	him as His Messenger. Therefore there was no justification for
	anyone to accuse the man who had never told a lie nor ever practiced
	forgery nor craftiness in his whole life, of ascribing falsely to
	Allah his own literary creation, and claiming categorically and
	persistently that it was of ' Divine Origin. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">That is
	why Allah has asked His Messenger to refute their absurd charge by
	saying, as it were, only this: &quot;O my people, use your
	commonsense before making this absurd accusation, for I am not a
	stranger or a foreigner among you. I have lived a life-time of forty
	years among you before making a claim that I have received
	Revelation from Allah. How can you expect from my past that I would
	present the Qur'an to you as Allah's Book, without gaining knowledge
	from Him and without His Command?&quot; (For further details sec
	Surah Al-Qasas, E.N. 109).&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote22sym" HREF="#sdfootnote22anc">22</A>That
	is, &quot;If these Revelations are not from Allah and I myself
	compose them and present them as Revelations from Him, there can be
	no greater sinner than I. On the other hand, if these Revelations
	are truly from Allah and you are falsifying these, then there can be

<DIV ID="sdfootnote23">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote23sym" HREF="#sdfootnote23anc">23</A>Some
	foolish people draw wrong and misleading conclusions from this
	verse, by a fallacious reasoning. They confine the meanings of
	(falah) to &quot;long lift&quot; or &quot;worldly prosperity&quot;
	or &quot;worldly success&quot; and argue like this: This verse
	declares categorically that &quot;criminals can never attain
	success.&quot; The converse of this proposition, that is, &quot;anyone
	who is successful cannot be a criminal&quot; must also be true.
	Hence, if a claimant should live a long life after his claim to
	Prophethood or prosper in the world or his claim receives a good
	response in the world from the people, he should be acknowledged as
	a true prophet. For they argue, if he had been a false prophet he
	could not have &quot;prospered,&quot; but would have been killed or
	starved to death or rendered unsuccessful in his mission, as soon as
	he had claimed to be a prophet. But even a little thinking will show
	that this &quot;argument&quot; is fallacious on the face of it.
	Firstly, the converse of every proposition is not always true.
	Secondly, the Qur'an does not use the word falah in this limited
	sense. Thirdly, Allah deals with the criminals according to His
	Divine Law of respite. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the matter in detail. The words &quot;Indeed the
	criminals cannot attain success&quot;, have not been used, in the
	context they occur, to prescribe a criterion for judging a true
	Prophet from a false one, so that if a claimant is &quot;successful&quot;,
	he should be accepted, and if he is not, he should be rejected. As a
	matter of fact, these words have been put in the mouth of the
	Messenger to make a declaration like this: &quot;I know it for
	certain that the criminals cannot attain (true) success: therefore I
	cannot commit the crime of making a false claim to Prophethood. But
	as regards you, I am absolutely sure that you cannot attain true
	success because you are guilty of falsifying me who is a true
	Prophet of Allah.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	thing is that the word falah is not used in the limited sense of
	&quot;worldly success&quot;, but it has been used to denote the
	permanent 'success' which never suffers any loss whatsoever
	irrespective of the fact whether the claimant gains or does not gain
	any worldly success in the initial stage. Nay, it is just possible
	that a false &quot;claimant&quot; who invites people to misguidance
	should attain great worldly &quot;success&quot; and his misguidance
	might also prosper. This is, however, not success in the terminology
	of the Qur'an, but this would be an utter failure. On the other
	hand, it is also possible that the inviter to the Truth should
	suffer untold afflictions or fall a prey to the persecutions of the
	transgressors, and leave this world without winning over anyone to
	the side of the Truth, but this will be, in the terminology of the
	Qur'an, true success and not a failure.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	thing that refutes the fallacy of these foolish people is that they
	do not take into consideration the &quot;Divine Law of Respite&quot;,
	according to which the mere fact that a false prophet enjoyed a long
	&quot;prosperous&quot; life is not a proof that he was a true
	prophet. The Qur'an has made it clear at many places that Allah does
	not expedite the matter of the punishment of the criminals, but
	gives them respite to mend their ways; nay, He also lets them loose
	in their deviation if they abuse that respite and become more
	corrupt. Sometimes He makes them even more &quot;prosperous&quot; so
	that they should fully manifest all the evils they had hidden in
	their hearts and incur full punishment which they really deserve for
	their evil deeds. The &quot;Divine Law of Respite&quot; takes its
	due course in the case of false prophets as it does in the case of
	other criminals. And there is no reason why they should be an
	exception to this. Satan, the greatest of all criminals, has been
	allowed to practice every kind of deception up to the Day of
	Judgment, and there is no mention of any exception to this effect
	that he will not be allowed to set up a false prophet.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As a last
	resort, such perverse interpreters of the Qur'an turn to vv. 44-47
	of Surah Al-Haqqah: &quot;If Muhammad had fabricated something
	himself and ascribed that to Us, We would have seized his hand and
	cut off his heart's vein.&quot; But these cannot serve their
	purpose, for what they imply is only this: &quot;If the true Prophet
	appointed by Allah were to ascribe any false thing to Allah, he
	would be seized forthwith&quot; . Therefore it is no more than a
	fallacy to argue from this to the erroneous conclusion that the
	impostor who is not seized is a true prophet, for this Divine
	principle applies only to a true Prophet and not to an impostor. In
	order to grasp this point, let us take the instance of the
	government servants. It is obvious that the rules and regulations
	which are prescribed for government servants apply only to those who
	are actually government servants and not to impostors. Those who
	pretend to be government servants are dealt with according to the
	criminal code like other criminals and villains and not according to
	the code of employment. Besides this, the context in which these
	verses occur clearly shows that these are not laying down any
	criterion of judging whether a claimant is a true Prophet or an
	impostor. For, in continuation of the preceding verse (43), the
	passage will, so to say, read like this: &quot;This is the
	Revelation sent down from the Lord of the universe. If Muhammad had
	himself fabricated this and ascribed that to Us, We would
	have........&quot; Moreover, a true Prophet can easily be
	distinguished from an impostor by his high character, his noble
	mission and the unique Message he presents. Hence there was no need
	of setting up such an irrational and unnatural standard of
	distinguishing a true Prophet from an impostor.&nbsp; &quot;

	is one of the series of questions that have been posed to refute the
	doctrine of shirk and to establish the doctrine of Tauhid. Besides,
	it is also meant to focus attention on the importance of the
	guidance to the Truth, which is one of the greatest human
	necessities. For it is obvious that the human needs and requirements
	are not confined to food, clothes and the like necessities of the
	physical life nor to its protection from losses, distresses,
	calamities etc. But one of man's needs (nay, his greatest need) is
	to have the knowledge of the right way of life so that he may, on
	the whole, achieve success in it. It is obvious that in order to be
	successful in life, man should have the correct knowledge of the use
	he should make of and the way he should employ his own physical,
	mental and spiritual powers and capabilities and natural resources.
	He should also know the nature and the kind of behavior he should
	adopt towards other human beings (and as a whole, towards the system
	of the universe in which he has inevitably to live and work), with
	whom he comes into contact in different capacities. The Qur'an calls
	that right way &quot;The Truth&quot; and the guidance that leads to
	that way, &quot;The Guidance to the Truth&quot;.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us turn to the question that has been posed in this verso. The
	Qur'an asks the mushriks and all those people who reject the
	teachings of the Holy Prophet: Is there any of the partners and gods
	you have set up besides Allah, who guides you to the Truth or can do
	so? Obviously the answer to this will surely be in the negative for
	neither of the classes of gods is capable of this: First, let us
	consider this with regard to those gods and goddesses and living or
	dead human beings, who are worshiped as gods. Though it is true that
	people turn to them for the fulfillment of their needs or for their
	protection from calamities in some supernatural way, yet they never
	turn to them to seek guidance to the Truth nor have they themselves
	ever sent it nor do their devotees ever claim that their deities
	teach them the principles of morality, sociology, culture,
	economics, politics, law, justice and the like.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then
	there is the case of those who make rules, regulations and laws
	which others accept and follow. It is true that such persons are
	accepted and followed as leaders, but the pertinent question is
	this: Are they the real guides to the Truth, or are they capable of
	becoming guides to it? Does any one of them possess the kind of
	knowledge that comprehends all those truths that are a prerequisite
	for formulating right principles for the guidance of human life ?
	Can anyone of them have full vision of the vast field of activities
	over which the human problems spread? Is there anyone of them who is
	absolutely free from the weaknesses, prejudices, personal or
	communal interests, which become hindrances to the formulation of
	just laws? If the answers to these questions are in the negative
	(and obviously no one in his senses can answer otherwise), how can
	then people with such limitations be expected to be the source of
	guidance to the Truth?</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	light of the above questions, we are able to grasp the signification
	of the question that has been posed in the Qur'an: &quot;Is there
	any of the partners you have set up with Allah who can guide you to
	the Truth ?&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	shows conclusively that Allah alone has the power to satisfy all the
	human needs and requirements, which may be divided into two
	categories. First, man stands in need of a providence, a protector,
	a being to hear and grant his prayers, in short, a permanent support
	to which he may turn whenever other supports should fail him. The
	above question inevitably leads to the conclusion that there is no
	god other than Allah who can fulfill these needs. The other human
	needs and requirements demand that there should be a guide to lay
	down such principles for the conduct of human life in its entirety
	as should be obeyed with perfect confidence and peace of mind. The
	question posed in v. 35 implies that that &quot;Being&quot; can be
	none other than Allah. Therefore there remains no argument in
	support of the point that the principles of culture, morality, and
	politics should be based on shirk or secularism except that one
	should persist in obduracy and obstinacy .

	the Holy Prophet, they were really meant to reprove and admonish the
	disbelievers in a subtle manner so as to arouse their dormant
	faculties of hearing and seeing and open these for the reception and
	acceptance of the rational and sympathetic Message. In order to
	understand the wisdom of this indirect method of admonition, let us
	take the example of two righteous friends. One of them who lived
	among corrupt people did his very best to convey the righteous
	message both by precept and by practice. He set the model of the
	highest moral conduct and character before them, and urged them in a
	sincere and sympathetic manner to consider their own moral
	condition, and admonished them in a very sincere and rational manner
	to make them realize that they were living in a very corrupt moral
	state, and advised them to adopt the right way of life. But none of
	them would pay any attention to his admonition nor learn any lesson
	from his pure life. Suppose his friend came there at that time and
	said: &quot;Why are you giving advice to these deaf people and
	showing the way to these blind ones, who have no ears for good
	things and no eyes for the right way ?&quot; It is obvious that
	these words would not have been uttered by way of dissuading the
	first friend from doing his reform work but for arousing the dormant
	faculties of the corrupt people by this subtle indirect method.</P>

	is a concise statement of a very important subject and requires a
	detailed explanation. The Qur'an declares in a few words that all
	religions other than the Revealed one are false because they have
	been founded on there philosophical research for the primary cause
	of the origin of the universe. The philosophical research is after
	all based on guess-work, and is in its very nature incapable of
	reaching the Truth. The right way of arriving at the Truth is to
	make a study of the signs (e.g. day and night) and of the Message of
	the Prophets in a dispassionate manner. For this is the only way of
	discovering the Truth: otherwise, if one follows wrong ways one
	shall always arrive at wrong conclusions. Let us now consider the
	several methods that different people have adopted in search of this
	knowledge: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	mushriks bast their search wholly and solely on superstition. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	hermits and ascetics pretend and claim that they acquire that
	knowledge by means of contemplation and meditation and see the
	reality by peeping into the hidden. But the fact is that they do not
	see the reality; it is only a trick of their own imagination. They
	form a mental image and then concentrate their mind on it and
	eventually it takes the shape of the &quot;reality.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	so-called philosophers claim to base their researches on rationalism
	but it is really only surmise and guess-work, even though they may
	give &quot;logical&quot; arguments and &quot;sound&quot; reasons in
	its support. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then
	there are the scientists: though they follow the scientific method
	of research in the physical world, they abandon it completely in
	regard to their investigation into metaphysics and start to follow
	conjectures, surmises, and guess-work.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then
	these groups invariably suffer from prejudices and are not inclined
	to understand the point of view of those who differ with them, and,
	therefore, obstinately stick to their own theories.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	passage (vv. 66-67) the Qur'an declares that this way of search
	after knowledge is basically wrong, as if to say, &quot;The real
	cause of your deviation is that you base your search of Reality on
	mere surmise and guess-work, and then, because of your prejudices,
	refuse to listen even to reasonable things. The result is that you
	have not only failed to arrive at the truth but also to judge
	rightly the Revealed Religion, presented by the Messengers.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In
	contrast to the above ways of research, the Qur'an presents its own
	way and asserts that it alone is the correct, rational and
	scientific way of arriving at the Truth. It is this: &quot;The
	prerequisite for research is that you should give up your
	preconceived prejudices and listen to the Message of those who claim
	that their information about the Reality is based on &quot;Knowledge&quot;
	and not on surmises, guess-works, meditations and contemplations,
	abstract deductions etc. Then consider deeply the Signs in the
	universe to which the Qur'an invites your attention. If these also
	point to the Reality they claim to reveal, amen there is no reason
	why you should deny the Truth taught by those Messengers.&quot; This
	is the basis of the philosophy of Islam. What a pity that even the
	Muslim philosophers have forsaken this way and followed in the
	footsteps of Plato and Aristotle!</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Qur'an has inculcated this method at many places and has over and
	again presented many a phenomenon as a proof of the Reality, and
	taught the people how to arrive at the right conclusion so as to
	perceive the Reality. Accordingly, in verse 67, the Sign of the
	night and the day has been presented for the deep consideration of
	the people. The change of day and night is a wonderful Sign and
	clearly points to the Universal Designer and the All-Powerful Ruler;
	for it takes place by the turning of the earth on its axis and in
	relation to the sun with mathematical precision. This change is due
	to the great wisdom of the Designer and has a great purpose behind
	it because of its innumerable benefits for all that exists on the
	earth. This points out also to the Providence of the Creator for it
	demonstrates conclusively that He has made perfect arrangements for
	the existence of His creation. Moreover, this also shows that the
	Universal Designer is One and also that He is not playful but Wise
	and purposeful. This change points also towards the great Reality
	that He, being the Benefactor and Lord, is worthy of worship and
	none else. This is because every other being is provided with its
	requirements by this change of day and night and none provides
	others; therefore none of them can be the Lord and the Master. In
	the light of these Signs, how can, any other religion, based on mere
	surmise and guess-work, be considered to be true when it is compared
	with the Revealed Religion which is based on such clear Signs as
	these?

	pure and without any defect, (2) Allah is Self-sufficient in every
	way, and (3) Allah is the Owner of everything in the heavens and the
	earth. Let us now briefly explain how these three things refute that
	blasphemy.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is
	obvious that a son is either sprung from the loins or is adopted. In
	the first case, such a conception of Allah amounts to this: He is
	mortal like every other being: therefore He stands in need of a
	spouse in order to propagate His offspring like other beings. In the
	second case, it shall have. to be presumed that Allah stands in need
	of a son to inherit His Kingdom in order to make up, to some extent,
	for the deficiency that is caused by His childlessness. Or that
	Allah also cherished paternal love like human beings, and therefore,
	adopted as son one of the millions of His slaves.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Whatever
	be the case, it is obvious that the blasphemy shall have to be based
	on such a creed which presumes that Allah suffers from many defects,
	many weaknesses, many shortcomings and many wants. The Qur'an
	refutes all such blasphemous creeds, saying, &quot;He is All-Pure&quot;
	and therefore, is free from all such defects; and by &quot;He is
	Self-sufficient&quot;, the Qur'an asserts that He does not suffer
	from any of those weaknesses and wants which impel the mortals to
	have children. Lastly, it says clearly that all the beings in the
	heavens and the earth belong to Him and that He has no particular
	relation with anyone of them so as to make such a one His &quot;son&quot;
	or &quot;only son&quot; or heir apparent. Though it is true that
	Allah loves some of His slaves more than the others because of their
	excellences, it does not in any way mean that He raises such a one
	from the rank of a slave to that of a partner in His Godhead. For,
	the highest rank He bestows on them is that they are Allah's
	friends, &quot;....who believe and fear Allah, (and therefore they)
	shall have no occasion for fear and sorrow. There is nothing but
	good news for them in this world and in the Hereafter. &quot; ( vv.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote75sym" HREF="#sdfootnote75anc">74</A>The
	story of Prophet Moses and Pharaoh is being related also to serve as
	an object-lesson for the Quraish, who were behaving towards Prophet
	Muhammad in the same way as Pharaoh and his people had behaved
	towards Prophet Moses (Allah's peace be upon them); for the response
	to the Message by the Quraish was similar to that of Pharaoh's
	people. (Please refer to v. 2 of this Surah. ) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, it will also be worthwhile to note that the Mission of
	Prophets Moses and Aaron was not merely to liberate the Israelites
	from the slavery of Pharaoh, as some people have opined. If we keep
	in view the context in which the story occurs here, it will be quite
	clear that they, too, were appointed to pursue the same Mission that
	was entrusted to all the Prophets from Noah to Muhammad (Allah's
	peace be upon them all). The theme of this Surah from its very
	beginning has been this: &quot;Acknowledge Allah alone as your Lord
	and Deity for He is the Lord of the whole universe. Relieve in the
	life-after-death in which you shall have to present yourselves
	before Allah and render the account of all you did in this world. &quot;
	Then the Surah makes it clear to those who rejected the Message that
	history bears witness to this that the true success of humanity has
	always followed the acceptance of this Message. Therefore it
	admonished them: &quot;You should also accept the Message which has
	always been put forward by all the Messengers, and establish your
	life in its entirety on these Articles of Faith. For those who
	rejected the Message were destroyed in the end. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus it
	has become quite clear from the context in which their story occurs,
	that the main object of the Mission of Prophets Moses and Aaron was
	the same as that of all the other Prophets. It is true that one of
	their objects was also to liberate the Israelites (a Muslim
	Community) from the domination of a kafir community, if it persisted
	in its unbelief. But this had a secondary place in their Mission,
	and was not its main object. The real object has been stated
	explicitly in LXXIX, vv. 17-19, wherein his Lord said to Moses: &quot;Go
	to Pharaoh for he has transgressed the bounds of subjection and say
	to him, &quot;Are you prepared to reform yourselves and fear your
	Lord, if I guide you towards Him' ?&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The part
	played by the two Prophets in liberating the Israelites from
	Pharaoh's slavery became prominent in history because he and his'
	nobles rejected the Message and the Prophets had to rescue their
	people from their slavery. Accordingly, the Qur'an gave it the same
	prominence as in history. But if one does not commit the error of
	isolating the details of the Qur'an from its fundamental principles
	but studies them in the light of these principles, one cannot fall a
	prey to the misunderstanding that the mere liberation of a community
	could be the main object of the mission of a Prophet and the
	propagation of the Message its secondary object only. (For further
	explanation sec XX: 44-52, XLIII: 46-56, LXXIII : 15-16). &nbsp;

	who came forward were not the elders and the old people but some
	courageous youth. These first Muslims who were boldly facing
	persecution and enduring hardships for the sake of Islam were the
	young people. For instance, `Ali-ibn-Abi Talib, Ja`afar Tayyar,
	Zubair, Talhah, Sa`ad bin Abi Waqqas, Mus`ab bin `Umair, `Abdullah

	eradicate the prevalent evil, they come into conflict with unjust
	people, who, for one reason or the other, are always on the look-out
	to find fault with them. First, there are the champions of

	the champions of the Truth. Then there are the so-called champions
	of the Truth who profess to believe in it but are not prepared to
	enter into conflict with the powerful government of the time.
	Therefore they declare it to be a useless and foolish effort, and
	begin to invent excuses to justify the wrong stand they take in
	regard to the struggle with falsehood in order to silence the prick
	of conscience they feel for their criminal attitude of cowardice.
	Accordingly, they try to prove that it is these standard-bearers of
	the Truth who are in the wrong and not they. Lastly, there are the
	common people, who watch the conflict as by-standers and join forces
	with those who prove to be more powerful of the two, whether they
	are the supporters of the Truth or of falsehood. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let

	cause of trial for these unjust people. If they are crushed down or
	defeated, the first group declares, &quot;We were in the right and
	not these foolish people: otherwise they could not have been
	defeated. &quot; The second group says, &quot;Their defeat has
	proved that they did not make the correct estimate of the
	circumstances and caused the destruction of valuable lives by coming
	in conflict with the mighty powers. Moreover, the Shari`at has not
	made it obligatory on unto expose ourselves to risk, when we are
	fulfilling the most essential religious duties without any
	restrictions from the tyrants of the day.&quot; As regards the
	common people, their criterion of judging the Truth is this:
	&quot;Whatever triumphs is truth. Therefore their defeat has proved
	that the champions of the Truth must be in the wrong. &quot;
	Likewise every mistake and error the champions of the Truth commit,
	every weakness they show in the face of overwhelming odds against
	them, every moral fault to which anyone of them succumbs, becomes a
	good excuse for those who intend to stick to falsehood.
	Consequently, the &quot;invitation&quot; to the Truth becomes
	dormant for years after their &quot;defeat&quot;.</P>

	wording and the circumstances under which this was sent down, and
	have come to the conclusion that Prophet Moses was commanded to
	build or acquire some houses for the establishment of Salat in
	congregation This was necessitated because the system of Salat in
	congregation had been abandoned by the Israelites and the Egyptian
	Muslims as a result of their persecution by the government, and

	Prophet Jonah (860-784 B.C.) was an Israelite Prophet, he was sent
	to 'Iraq for the guidance of the Assyrians, who have been called the
	people of Jonah for this reason. At that time, Nineveh, a very
	ancient and famous city, was their capital. Its vast remains are
	scattered on the left bank of the Tigris, opposite to the city of
	Mosul, and one of the mounds bears the name of 'Prophet Jonah' . In
	order to form an estimate of the glory of these people, suffice it
	to say that the circumference of their capital Nineveh was 60 miles
	or so.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote100sym" HREF="#sdfootnote100anc">99</A>As
	regards the question why the threatened torment was warded off from
	the people of Jonah as an exception to the Divine principle, &quot;After
	the decision of the torment, the profession of faith by any
	community does not benefit it,&quot; the Qur'an does not give any
	details of this, but merely refers to the story at three places.
	(See XXI: 87, 88; XXXII: 139-148; LXVIII: 48-50). Though the story
	contained in the Book of Jonah gives some details, these cannot be
	depended upon because it was neither composed by Prophet Jonah nor
	it is a Revealed Book but was written by some unknown person and
	then inserted in the Bible. Besides this, it contains some
	apparently absurd things which cannot be accepted as true.
	Nevertheless if we consider this deeply in the light of the
	allusions made in the Qur'an and details in the Book of Jonah, the
	explanation given by various commentators of the Qur'an seems to be
	correct.-Prophet Jonah left the place of his Mission without Divine
	permission after warning the people of the torment. Therefore Allah
	forgave the Assyrians, when they repented after seeing some Signs of
	the coming torment. This was in accordance with the Divine
	principles as stated in the Qur'an. For, according to one of these,
	Allah does not inflict any torment on any people, till He has the
	Message fully demonstrated to them. As the Prophet did not continue
	his admonition in accordance with the appointed term and left the
	place of his Mission of his own accord, Allah's justice did not
	inflict the chastisement because the legal argument against his
	people had not been fulfilled. (For further explanation see E.N. 85
	of XXXVI). &nbsp;

	the Assyrians believed in the Message, they were given a new lease
	of life. But after some time, they adopted the wrong ways of thought
	and deed. Prophet Nahum (720-698 B.C.) warned and admonished them
	but without any effect. Then Prophet Zephaniah (640-609 B.C.) gave
	them the last warning that &quot;he .... will destroy Assyria and
	will make Nineveh a desolation&quot; but it also proved in vain. At
	last in about 612 B.C., Allah made the Medes dominant over them.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Median king, with the help of the Babylonians, invaded Assyria, and
	their army was defeated and was besieged within the walls of
	Nineveh. They put up a stiff resistance for some time but then the
	floods in the Tigris swept away the city wall and the invaders
	swarmed into the city and burnt it to ashes along with the
	surrounding countryside. The Assyrian king set fire to his palace
	and was himself burnt to death. Thus the Assyrian Empire and its
	culture came to an end for ever. The recent archaeological
	excavations reveal widespread effects of the fire.

	refers to the freedom that Allah has granted to mankind to believe
	or not to believe in Him. Otherwise He could have very easily
	created all the people as born believers and obedient servants and
	there would have been no disbelief and disobedience at all on the
	earth. Or He could have very easily inspired them to turn towards
	belief and obedience. But these methods would have defeated the

	does not at all mean that the Holy Prophet desired to force people
	to become believers, and that Allah was forbidding him to do this.
	In fact, the Qur'an has here adopted the same method of admonishing
	the people that it has adopted at many other places, that is, though
	the words have apparently been addressed to the person of the Holy
	Prophet, in fact, these have been addressed to the people. The
	implication is this: &quot;O people! Our Messenger has made the
	distinction between the Guidance and deviation quite clear and plain
	by argument and pleading. Now, therefore, it is for you to believe
	or not to believe in the Guidance. If you accept that some one
	should force you to adopt the Right Way, you should know that this
	`duty' has not been assigned to Our Prophet. Had Allah willed this,
	He could have done it Himself: then there would have been no need of
	sending any Prophet to you.&quot;</P>

	is to emphasize the principle that the bestowal of all these
	blessings is in the power of Allah alone: therefore none can acquire
	or bestow on anyone any blessing without the permission of Allah. As
	faith and guidance also are blessings, they, too, can be acquired
	only with Allah's permission; and no one can acquire these without
	His permission nor bestow these on anyone else even though one
	should desire to do so. That is why, even if the Prophet had
	sincerely desired to make people believers forcibly, he could not
	have done this, for this could be done only with Allah's permission
	and help.</P>

	points out clearly that the above principle is not applied blindly
	and irrationally so as to bestow the blessing of faith on or
	withhold it from anyone without any rhyme or reason, but it works
	according to a system which is based on wisdom. Allah bestows this
	on anyone who uses his common sense properly in starch of the Truth,
	for Allah provides for such a one the means of attaining it in
	proportion to the sincerity of his intention and the extent of his
	exertion and grants him its correct knowledge required for faith.
	But He throws the filth of ignorance, deviation, wrong thinking and
	wrong doing on the one who is not a seeker after the Truth and does
	not seek the Truth and does not use his common-sense properly
	because of his prejudices, or does not use it at all in search of
	the Truth. And this is what such people deserve.</P>

	is the answer to the condition that they would believe him to be a
	true Prophet, if a Sign would be shown to them. The Holy Prophet has
	been asked to say to them, &quot;There are countless Signs in the
	heaven and the earth, which confirm and testify the Message I am
	giving you. You could have easily recognized them, had you observed
	and considered them with open eyes and open hearts. But if you lack
	this urge and desire for the Truth, you will not accept and
	acknowledge it, however wonderful, miraculous and supernatural the
	sign may be, for you will declare that it was a piece of sorcery
	like Pharaoh and his chiefs. The fact is that the people, who suffer
	from this malady, see the Truth only when the torment with all its
	horrors overtakes them, just as Pharaoh came to believe only when he
	was drowning. But you should note it well that the repentance at the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote108sym" HREF="#sdfootnote108anc">107</A>The
	Arabic word literally means &quot;gives you death&quot;, but it has
	been purposely translated into &quot;who has power to cause your
	death&quot; in order to convey its real spirit in the content it
	occurs. It implies this: &quot;I worship only that One, who has full
	power over your life: He has complete authority and power to let you
	live as long as He wills and cause you to die at any moment He
	wills. That is why I am fully convinced that I should submit and
	surrender, worship, serve and obey Him alone.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider why of all His characteristics, this quality of Allah
	was specifically cited here. This was to bring home to the mushriks
	of Makkah that the doctrine of shirk was absolutely false. For they
	also believed (and all the mushriks have always believed) that death
	is entirely in the hands of Allah, the Lord of the universe, and
	none else has any power over it; so much so that they confessed that
	even those beings, whom they believed to be partners with God in
	other qualities and powers of, His, could not avert death even from
	themselves. Thus the mention of this quality of Allah along with the
	statement of the Doctrine of Tauhid has been made to serve as a
	proof of that creed. That is, &quot;I serve Him only for He alone
	has the full power over life and death. Why should, then, I serve
	others who have no power at all over their own lives and deaths, not
	to mention the lives and deaths of others?&quot; The eloquence and
	force of the statement has been enhanced manifold by saying,
	&quot;.......Who gives you life and death&quot; instead of &quot;.....Who
	gives me life and death&quot;. For this contains the statement of
	the Doctrine, its proof and invitation to it, all the three combined
	in one concise sentence. Had it been said, &quot;...I serve that one
	Who gives me death,&quot; then it would have implied, &quot;I alone
	should serve Him&quot;. But by saying. &quot;......Who gives you
	death&quot; the implication is: &quot;It is not only I, who should
	serve Him, but you also should serve Him. For it is absolutely wrong
	to serve any other than Allah, Who alone has such powers.&quot;</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote109">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote109sym" HREF="#sdfootnote109anc">108</A>The
	force of the Arabic words of the text &quot;Dedicate yourself
	sincerely, exclusively and steadfastly to this Faith&quot;, is worth
	deep consideration. The purpose might have been served by the use of
	such words as &quot;Adopt this Faith&quot; or &quot;Follow this
	Faith&quot;. But Allah considered such expressions as weak and
	incapable of serving the real purpose, which is implied in the
	wording of the Text. For the literal meaning is &quot;Set your face
	steadfastly&quot;, which implies, &quot;You should steadfastly turn
	your face in one direction only, without turning it even slightly to
	right or left, or backward, and go on marching in the same
	direction.&quot; Though these words were in themselves quite
	sufficient, the addition of the word made it all the more forceful.
	For (Hanif) is one who turns away from all others and exclusively
	turns to one direction. Thus what Allah demands is this: &quot;Adopt
	this Faith, this Way of the worship of Allah and this way of life in
	such a manner that your worship, subjection, submission, servitude
	and obedience should be dedicated exclusively to Allah, the Lord of
	the universe, so that you do not deviate in the least after adopting
	this Way, you should have nothing to do with those ways that you
	have discarded and that you should not even have a look at the
	crooked paths that erroneous people follow.&quot;</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote110">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote110sym" HREF="#sdfootnote110anc">109</A>This
	negative way of forbidding shirk has been purposely adopted. It
	implies this: &quot;You should not at all be one of those, who set
	up in any way whatsoever other gods as partners with Allah in His
	essence, His attributes, His rights and His powers, whether that god
	be one's own self or another man or a group of men or some spirit or
	Jinn or angel or some material or imaginary being.&quot; The demand
	of Tauhid has been made both in the positive form, &quot;Dedicate....
	Faith&quot;, and in the negative form, &quot;and be not....other
	gods with Allah. &quot; Thus it forbids shirk both in creed and in
	deed, in individual and in collective life, in places of worship and
	in education, in courts and in legislative assemblies in political
	and in economic activities. Therefore it demands from the worshiper
	of Tauhid to adopt a different way in every aspect of life from the
	way of those who adulterate God-worship with ungodly worships, for
	the former can never be a fellow traveler with those who practice
	shirk. As such things can never be expected from him, it can never
	be imagined that he would follow them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus it
	is clear that it cuts at the very root of shirk, both (Jali) open
	and (khafi) hidden. As a matter of fact, shirk in its latter form is
	even more dangerous and should therefore be avoided most
	scrupulously. This warning is necessary, as some foolish people
	consider it to be almost harmless just because it is hidden. The
	fact is that open shirk is like an avowed enemy who makes an attack
	in the open and hidden shirk is like an enemy in the guise of a
	friend. Or the former is like a disease of which the symptoms arc
	quite apparent and the latter like the hidden disease that gradually
	undermines one's health. Thus it is obvious that when the 'open'
	shirk comes into conflict with the Faith of Tauhid, it may be cured.
	But the one who suffers from the `hidden' shirk does not realize the
	threat posed by it and slowly and gradually succumbs to it, while
	the victim remains quite unaware that his Faith is being devoured by
	the deadly secret enemy.
