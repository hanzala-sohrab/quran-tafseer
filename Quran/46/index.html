<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
10th year of the Prophethood was a year of extreme persecution and
distress in the Holy prophet's life. The Quraish and the other tribes
had continued their boycott of the Bani Hashim and the Muslims for
three years and the Holy Prophet and the people of his family and
Companions lay besieged in Shi'b Abi Talib. The Quraish had blocked
up this locality from every side so that no supplies of any kind
could reach the besieged people. Only during the Hajj season they
were allowed to come out and buy some articles of necessity. But even
at that time whenever Abu Lahab noticed any of them approaching the
market place or a trading caravan he would call out to the merchants
exhorting them to announce forbidding rates of their articles for
them, and would pledge that he himself would buy those articles so
that they did not suffer any loss. This boycott which continued
uninterrupted for three years had broken the back of the Muslims and
the Bani Hashim; so much so that at times they were even forced to
eat grass and the leaves of trees. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At
last, when the siege was lifted this year, Abu Talib, the Holy
Prophet's uncle, who had been shielding him for ten long years, died,
and hardly a month later his wife, Hadrat Khadijah, who had been a
source of peace and consolation for him ever since the beginning of
the call, also passed away. Because of these tragic incidents, which
closely followed each other, the Holy Prophet used to refer to this
year as the year of sorrow and grief. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
the death of Hadart Khadijah and Abu Talib the disbelievers of Makkah
became even bolder against the Holy Prophet. They started treating
him even more harshly. So much so that it became difficult for him to
step out of his house. Of these days Ibn Hisham has related the
incident that a Quraish scoundrel one day threw dust at him openly in
the street. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

last, the Holy Prophet left for Ta'if with the intention that he
should invite the Bani Thaqif to Islam, for even if they did not
accept Islam, they might at least be persuaded to allow him to work
for his mission peacefully. He did not have the facility of any
conveyance at that time, and traveled all the way to Ta'if on foot.
According to some traditions, he had gone there alone, but according
to others, he was accompanied by Zaid bin Harithah. He stayed at
Ta'if for a few days, and approached each of the chiefs and nobles of
the Bani Thaqif and talked to him about his mission. But not only
they refused to listen to him, but plainly gave him the notice that
he should leave their city, for they feared that his preaching might
&quot;spoil&quot; their younger generation. Thus, he was compelled to
leave Ta'if. When he was leaving the city, the chiefs of Thaqif set
their slaves and scoundrels behind him, who went on crying at him,
abusing him and petting him with stones for a long way from either
side of the road till he became broken down with wounds and his shoes
were filled with blood. Wearied and exhausted he took shelter in the
shade of the wall of a garden outside Ta'if, and prayed: </FONT></FONT></FONT>

this he went to stay for a few days at Makkah, perplexed as to how he
would face the people of Makkah, who, he thought, would be still
further emboldened against him after hearing what had happened at
Ta'if. It was here that one night when he was reciting the Qur'an in
the Prayer, a group of the jinn happened to pass by and listened to
the Qur'an, believed in it, and returned to their people to preach
Islam. Thus, Allah gave His Prophet the good news that if the men
were running away from his invitation, there were many of the jinn,
who had become its believers, and they were spreading his message
among their own kind. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Such
were the conditions when this Surah was sent down. Anyone who keeps
this background in view, on the one hand, and studies this Surah, on
the other, will have no doubt left in his mind that this is not at
all the composition of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace), but &quot;a
Revelation from the All Mighty, All Wise Allah.&quot; For nowhere in
this Surah, from the beginning to the end, does one find even a tinge
of the human feelings and reactions, which are naturally produced in
a man who is passing through such hard conditions. Had it been the
word of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) whom the occurrence of
personal griefs one after the other and the countless and the recent
bitter experience at Ta'if had caused extreme anguish and distress,
it would have reflected in some degree the state of the mind of the
man who was the subject of these afflictions and griefs. Consider the
prayer that we have cited above: it contains his own language its
every word is saturated with the feelings that he had at the time.
But this Surah which was sent down precisely in the same period and
was recited even by him under the same conditions, is absolutely free
from every sign or trace of the time. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
subject matter of the Surah is to warn the disbelievers of the errors
in which they were involved, and also resisted arrogantly, and were
condemning the man who was trying to redeem them. They regarded the
world as a useless and purposeless place where they were not
answerable to anyone. They thought that invitation to </FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Tauhid</FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
was false and stuck to the belief that their own deities were
actually the associates of Allah. They were not inclined to believe
that the Qur'an was the Word of the Lord of the worlds. They had a
strange erroneous concept of apostleship on the basis of which they
were proposing strange criteria of judging the Holy Prophet's claim
to it. In their estimation one great proof of Islam's not being based
on the truth was that their elders and important chiefs of the tribes
and so called leaders of their nation were not accepting it and only
a few young men, and some poor folks and some slaves had affirmed
faith in it. They thought that Resurrection and life after death and
the rewards and punishments of the Hereafter were fabrications whose
occurrence was absolutely out of the question. </FONT></SPAN>

this Surah each of these misconceptions has been refuted in a brief
but rational way, and the disbelievers have been warned that if they
would reject the invitation of the Qur'an and the Prophethood of the
Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) by prejudice and
stubbornness instead of trying to understand its truth rationally,
they would only be preparing for their own doom. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	is, &quot;The actual fact is that this universe is not a purposeless
	plaything but a purposeful, wise system in which the decisions
	regarding the good and the bad, the oppressor and the oppressed,
	will necessarily be based on justice; and the present system of the
	universe is not permanent and eternal, but it has a fixed term
	appointed for it on the expiry of which it will inevitably come to
	an end. For the Court of Allah also there is a settled time and it
	will certainly be established when the time for it reaches its term.
	But the people who have refused to believe in Allah's Prophet and
	His Book, have an aversion to these truths. They are least mindful
	of this that a time has to come when they will have to render an
	account of their deeds. They think that the Messenger of Allah has
	done them a great wrong by warning them of these truths, whereas he
	has done them a great good by fore-warning them not only of the time
	when they will be subjected to accountability but also of what they
	will be questioned at that time so that they may prepare themselves
	accordingly.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">To
	understand the following discourse it should be borne in mind that
	man's basic error is the one that he commits with regard to
	determining his belief about God. In this regard, the adoption of a
	creed carelessly on the basis of mere hearsay, without any serious
	and deep thought and investigation, is a stupendous folly, which
	vitiates man's whole attitude to life in the world and ruins his
	destiny for ever afterwards. But the reason why man becomes involved
	in this dangerous kind of heedlessness is that he regards himself as
	irresponsible and un-answerable and develops the misunderstanding
	that whatever creed he may adopt about God, it would make no
	difference, because either there is no life after death in which he
	might have to face accountability, or if there is any such life and
	he is also called to account, the beings of whom he is a devotee,
	will save him from any evil fate. This same lack of the sense of
	responsibility renders him frivolous in the selection of a religious
	creed, and on the basis of the same he fabricates all sorts of
	absurd creeds, from atheism to every form of polytheism, or adopts
	the creeds fabricated by others.&nbsp; &quot;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote4">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>As
	the addresses are a polytheistic people they are being told the
	reality of the irrational crced in which they persisted carelessly
	due to lack of the sense of responsibility. Along with acknowledging
	Allah as the Creator of the universe they had made many other beings
	their deities: they invoked them, regarded them as fulfillers of
	their needs and removers of hardships: prostrated themselves and
	made offerings before them, and thought they had the powers of
	making and unmaking of heir destinies. About the same beings, they
	are being asked: &quot;On what basis have you made them your deities
	?&quot; Obviously, there can be only two bases for regarding someone
	as an associate in worship along with Allah: either man himself
	should know through some means of knowledge that his deity too has a
	share in making the earth and heavens, or Allah Himself may have
	stated that so and-so also is His associate in the functions of
	Godhead. Now, if a polytheist can neither make the claim that he
	possesses direct knowledge of his deity's being an associate of God,
	nor he can show in a Book sent by God that God Himself has appointed
	somebody as His associate, his creed would inevitably be baseless.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this

	righteous men of the ancient times, which may have reached the later
	generations reliably. There is no tinge of shirk in whatever man has
	received through these two means. All the heavenly Books unanimously
	present the same Tauhid to which the Qur'an invites the people, and
	no existing remnant of the ancient lore bears evidence to this that
	some Prophet or saint or righteous man might have taught the people
	to serve and worship any other than God. Even if we do not take a
	Book to mean a Divine Book and remnant of knowledge the knowledge
	bequeathed by the Prophets and righteous men, no authentic book or
	the research made by a scholar of religious or secular lore has
	pointed out that such and such a thing in the earth or the heavens

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) the
	wicked men who had themselves gone astray, and who misled others and
	passed away. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the first category of the deities they will naturally remain unaware
	of the supplications of their worshipers. As for the deities of the
	second kind, who were favorites with their God, there are two
	reasons of their remaining unaware: (a) They are in the presence of
	Allah in a state where human voices cannot reach them directly; and
	(b) even Allah and His angels do not inform them that the people
	whom they had been teaching to invoke Allah alone in the world, were
	invoking them instead, for no information could cause them a greater
	shock than this, and Allah does not at all like to vex the souls of
	His righteous servants. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now if we
	consider the case of the third kind of the deities, we shall sec
	that there are two reasons also of their remaining unaware: (a) That
	they have been placed in confinement as the accused, and no voice
	from the world can reach them; and (b) that even Allah and His
	angels do not convey to them the news that their mission is
	flourishing in the world, and the people have set them up as
	deities, for this news would be a happy news for them, and Allah
	does not like to make the wicked people happy. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, one should also understand that Allah conveys to His
	righteous servants the greetings of peace and prayers of mercy from
	the people of the world, for these things arc a source of joy and
	pleasure for them; likewise, He informs the culprits of the curses,
	censures and condemnations of the people of the world, as the
	disbelievers killed in the Battle of Badr were made to hear the
	curse of the Holy Prophet according to a Hadith, for it is a cause
	of anguish for them. But anything which might cause distress to the
	righteous people and joy to the culprits is not conveyed to them.
	This explanation makes the truth about the,. question of hearing by
	the dead plain and easy to understand.&nbsp;

	background is this: When the Holy Prophet presented himself as
	Allah's Messenger, the people of Makkah raised different kinds of
	objections against it. They said: &quot;what kind of a Messenger he
	is who has a family, who moves about in the streets, eats and drinks
	and lives a common man's life. There is nothing special about him,
	which might distinguish him above the other people and therefore we
	may know that Allah has specially made this man His Messenger. &quot;
	Then they said: &quot;Had he ban appointed a Messenger by God, He
	would have sent an angel as an attendant with him who would have
	announced that he was God's Messenger, and would have punished with
	a scourge every such person who had behaved insolently Towards him.
	How strange that God should appoint a person as His Messenger and
	then should leave him alone to roam the streets of Makkah and suffer
	every kind of humiliation. If nothing else Allah should at least
	have created a magnificent palace and a blooming garden for His
	Messenger. He should not have been left to depend on his wife's
	resources so that 'when they exhausted the Messenger should be
	forced to go without food and should not even afford a conveyance to
	Ta'if.&quot; Besides, these people demanded different kinds of
	miracles from him and asked news of the unseen. They thought that a
	person's being God's Messenger meant that he should possess
	supernatural powers so that mountains should move at his bidding and
	deserts at once turn into green fields; he should have the knowledge
	of the past and the future events and of everything hidden from
	others.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, it
	is said: 'Tell them: I am not a novel Messenger. &quot; That is, &quot;My
	being appointed as a Messenger is not a novel event of its kind in
	the world so that you may have some confusion about the
	characteristics of a Messenger. Many Messengers have come to the
	world before me, and I am not any different from them. Never has a
	Messenger come, who did not have a family, who did not eat and
	drink, or who did not live a common man's life. Never has an angel
	descended as an attendant with a Messenger, heralding his
	prophethood and carrying a whip before him. Never have gardens and
	palaces been created for a Messenger and never has a Messenger ban
	spared of the hardships which I am suffering. Never has a Messenger
	shown a miracle by his own power, or known everything by his own
	knowledge. Then, how is it that you are bringing forth these strange
	criteria only to judge my Prophethood?&quot;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then it
	is said: Tell them also : &quot;I do not know what shall befall you

	revealed to me.&quot; That is, &quot;I am not a knower of the unseen
	so that everything of the past and present and future should be
	known to me, and I should have the knowledge of everything in the
	world. Not to speak of your future, I do not even know my own
	future. I only know that of which I am given knowledge by
	revelation. More than that I have never claimed to know, nor has
	there ever been a Messenger in the world, who made that claim. It is
	not a Messenger's job to tell the whereabouts of the lost articles,

	I may show you the wonderful miracles that you demand from me every

	large number of the commentators have taken this &quot;witness&quot;
	to imply Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Salam, who was a famous Jewish scholar
	of Madinah, and who believed in the Holy Prophet after the
	migration. As this thing happened in Madinah, these commentators say
	that this verse was revealed at Madinah. This commentary is based on
	a statement of Hadrat Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas according to which this
	verse was sent down in respect of Hadrat `Abdullah bin Salam
	(Bukhari, Muslim, Nasa'i Ibn Jarir); and on the same basis have
	several major commentators like Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah,
	Dahhak, Ibn Sirin, Hasan Basri, Ibn Zaid and `Auf bin Malik
	al-Ashja`i accepted this commentary. But, on the other hand,
	'Ikrimah and Sha`bi and Masruq say that this verse cannot be about
	`Abdullah bin Salam (may Allah be pleased with him) for this entire
	Surah was sent down at Makkah. Ibn Jarir Tabari also has preferred
	this view. He says: The whole previous discourse is an address
	directed to the pagans of Makkah and the following discourse also is
	directed to them. In this context it is not conceivable that a verse
	revealed at Madinah was inserted here. The later commentators who
	have accepted this second version, do not reject the tradition of
	Hadrat Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas, but have opined that as this verse also
	applies to Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Salam's affirmation of the faith,
	Hadrat Sa`d expressed the opinion, in the tradition of the ancients,
	that it was sent down with regard to him. This does not, however,
	mean that when he believed, it was revealed then about him only, but
	that this verse precisely applied to him and his acceptance of
	Islam. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Apparently,
	this second view seems to be more correct and reasonable. Now. the
	question that remains to be answered is: Who is implied by this
	witness?&quot; Some of the commentators who have accepted the second
	view say that it implies the Prophet Moses (peace be upon him), but
	the following sentence: 'He believed white you showed arrogance&quot;,
	bears no relevance to this explanation. What seems to be nearer the
	truth is that which the commentator Nisaburi and Ibn Kathir have
	stated. They say: Here, by &quot;a witness&quot; is not meant any
	particular person but a common Israelite.. The meaning is this; &quot;The
	teachings that the Qur'an is presenting before you are not new so
	that you could deny them by offering the excuse that they were novel
	teachings which had never been presented before man in the past.
	Before this these very teachings have been similarly revealed and
	exist with the Israelites in the form of the Torah and other
	scriptures, and a common Israelite has already believed in them, and
	also admitted that Allah's Revelation is a means of the coming down
	of these teachings. Therefore, you cannot make the claim that
	Revelation and these teachings are incomprehensible. The only thing
	that hinders you from believing is your arrogance and baseless
	conceit. &quot;&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote19sym" HREF="#sdfootnote19anc">19</A>This
	verse tells that although the children should serve both the mother
	and the father, the mother's right is greater in importance, on the
	ground that she undergoes greater hardships for the sake of the
	children. The same is borne out by a Hadith, which has been related
	with a little variation in wording in Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud,
	Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Musnad Ahmad, and in Adab al-Mufrad of Imam
	Bukhari, to the effect that a person asked the Holy Prophet: &quot;Who
	has got a greater right to my service? The Holy Prophet replied:
	Your mother. He asked: Who after her? He replied: Your mother. He
	asked: Who after her? He replied: Your mother. He asked: Who after
	her? He replied: Your father; &quot; This Hadith precisely explains
	this verse, for in it also allusion has been made to the triple
	right of the mother: (1) His mother bore him with hardship; (2) she
	gave him birth with hardship; and (3) his bearing and his weaning
	took thirty months. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	legal point also is derived from this verse and verse 14 of Surah
	Luqman and verse 233 of Al-Baqarah, which was pointed out by Hadrat
	`Ali and Hadrat Ibn 'Abbas in a law case and made Hadrat `Uthman
	change his decision. The story goes that during the caliphate of
	Hadrat `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) a person married a
	woman from the Juhainah tribe, and just six months after the
	marriage she gave birth to a healthy and sound child. The man took
	the case before Hadrat `Uthman, who declared the woman to be an
	adultress and ordered that she be stoned to death. On hearing this
	Hadrat `Ali immediately came to Hadrat `Uthman and asked: What sort
	of a decision have you given ? He replied: She has given birth to a
	sound child six months after marriage. Is it not a clear .proof of
	her being an adultress? Hadrat `Ali did not agree, and recited the
	three above mentioned verses in their sequence. In Surah Al-Baqarah
	Allah says: 'The mothers shall suckle their children for two whole
	in years, if the fathers desire the suckling to be completed.&quot;
	In Surah Luqman it is said: &quot;And his weaning took two years,&quot;
	and in Surah AI-Ahqaf: &quot;And his bearing and his weaning took
	thirty months.&quot; Now, if two years of suckling are taken away
	from 30 months, six months of bearing remain. This shows that the
	minimum period of pregnancy in which a sound child can be born is
	six months. Therefore, the woman who has given birth to a child six
	months after the marriage cannot be declared an adulteress . On
	hearing this reasoning of Hadrat 'Ali, Hadrat 'Uthman admitted that
	he had not considered that thing at all. Then he recalled the woman
	and changed his decision. According to another tradition, Ibn 'Abbas
	also supported the reasoning of Hadrat 'Ali and then Hadrat 'Uthman
	changed his decision. (Ibn Jarir, Ahkam al-Qur an by al-Jassas Ibn
	Kathir). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	following legal injunctions are derived from the three verses when
	they are read together: The woman who gives birth to a sound and
	complete child in less than six months after marriage (i.e. in a
	proper delivery and not abortion) will be declared an adulteress and
	her child's lineage from her husband will not be established. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	woman who delivers a sound and complete child six months or more
	after marriage, cannot be accused of adultery only on the basis of
	the child birth, nor can her husband have the right to slander her,
	nor can he refuse to acknowledge fatherhood of the child; the child
	will certainly be recognized as his, and the woman will not be
	punished. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	maximum period for fosterage is two years. If a woman has suckled a
	child after this age, she will not be regarded as his foster mother,
	nor will the injunctions pertaining to fosterage (An-Nisa: 23) be
	applicable to her. In this regard, Imam Abu Hanifah has out of
	caution proposed the period of two and a half years instead of two
	years so that there remains no chance of error in a delicate matter
	like the prohibition of the foster relations. (For explanation, see
	E N. 23 of Surah Luqman). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, it
	would be useful to know that according to the latest medical
	research a child needs at least 28 weeks to remain in the mother's
	womb to be developed and delivered as a living baby. This period
	amounts to a little more than 6 months. The Islamic law has allowed
	a concession of about half a month, because a woman's being declared
	an adulteress and a child's being deprived of lineage is a grave
	matter, and its gravity demands that maximum period be allowed to
	save both the mother and the child from its legal consequences.
	Furthermore, no physician and no judge, not even the pregnant woman
	herself and the man impregnating her, can know as to when exactly
	did the conception take place. This thing also demands that a few
	more days be allowed in determining the minimum Legal period of
	pregnancy.&nbsp;

	the Revelations of Allah which give the right knowledge and

	understanding and knowledge he sees the right thing with his eyes,
	hears the right thing with his ears, thinks the right thing with his
	mind and intellect and takes the right decisions. But when he
	refuses to believe in the Revelations of Allah, he fails to see the

	in spite of the ears, and misuses the blessings of the mind and

	the idea that they were favorite servants of God and through them
	they would attain nearness to Him, but then gradually they made them
	their gods. They started invoking them for help; they formed the
	belief that they had the powers to change their destinies and could
	answer their prayers and remove their hardships.&quot; To deliver

	Messengers over and over again in different ways to bring them to
	the right path, but they persisted m the worship of their gods, and
	continued to insist that they would still invoke them instead of
	Allah. Now consider this: When the torment of Allah visited these

	Hadrat Zubair, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas, Hasan Basri, Said bin
	Jubair, Zarr bin Hubaish, Mujahid, 'ikrimah and others in connection
	with the commentary of this verse concur that this incident of the
	first visit of the jinns, which has been mentioned in this verse,
	had occurred in the valley of Nakhlah. And according to Ibn Ishaq,
	Abu Nu`aim Isfahaini and Waqidi, this incident occurred during the
	Holy Prophet's return journey from Ta'if to Makkah. On the way, when
	he halted at Nakhlah, and was reciting the Qur'an in the 'Isha' or
	the Fajr or the Tahajjud Prayer, a group of the jinns happened to
	pass by and stopped to listen to him. In this connection, all the
	traditions agree that on this occasion the jinns did not appear
	before the Holy Prophet, nor did he feel their presence, but Allah
	informed him afterwards by revelation that they had come and
	listened to the Qur'anic recitation.

	traditions show that after this several deputations of the jinns
	visited the Holy Prophet, one after the other, and met him face to
	face. When all the traditions related in the collections of Hadith
	on this subject are read together, it appears that at least six
	deputations had visited him in Makkah before the Hijrah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">About one
	of these deputations Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud relates: 'One day
	the Holy Prophet remained missing from Makkah for the whole night.
	We could not know his whereabouts and feared he might have been
	attacked by somebody. Early in the morning we saw him coming from
	the direction of Hira'. On inquiring he said that a jinn had come to
	invite him and he had accompanied him and recited the Qur'an to a
	gathering of them there.&quot; (Muslim, Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Abu
	Da'ud). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin Mas'ud has related another tradition, saying: &quot;Once
	the Holy Prophet asked his Companions in Makkah as to which of them
	would accompany him that night to meet the jinns. I became ready to
	go with him. At a place in the upper quarters of Makkah the Holy
	Prophet drew a line and told me not to cross it. Then he went
	forward and stood and began to recite the Qur'an. I saw that a
	number of the people had gathered around him and they stood between
	me and him.&quot;' (Ibn Jarir, Baihaqi: Dala`il an-Nubuwwat, Abu
	Nu`aim Isfahani: Dale Il an-Nubuwuat). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On
	another occasion also during the night Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas'ud
	was with the Holy Prophet and he decided a case of the jinns at
	Hajun in Makkah. Many years later Ibn Mas'ud saw a group of the
	villagers at Kufa and said that the group of the jinns he had seen
	at Hajun closely resembled those people. (Ibn Jarir).&nbsp;
