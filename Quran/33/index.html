<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Islamic army's setback in the Battle of Uhud (A. H. 3) that resulted
from the error of the archers appointed by the Holy Prophet so
boosted up the morale of the Arab pagans and the Jews and the
hypocrites that they started entertaining the hope that they would
soon be able to exterminate Islam and the Muslims completely. Their
high state of morale can be judged from the events that occurred in
the first year after Uhud. Hardly two months had passed then the
tribe of Bani Asad of Najd began to make preparations for a raid on
Madinah, and the Holy Prophet had to dispatch an expedition under Abu
Salamah to counteract them. In Safar A. H. 4 some people of the
tribes of Adal and Qarah asked the Holy Prophet to send some men to
instruct them in Islam. Accordingly six of the Companions were
allowed to accompany them for the purpose. But when they reached Raji
(a place between Rabigh and Jeddah), they summoned Hudhail against
them, who killed four of the Companions, and took the other two
(Hadrat Khubaib bin Adi and Hadrat Zaid bin ad-Dathinnah) to Makkah
and sold them to the enemy. Then in the same month of Safar, on the
request of a chief of Bani Amir, the Holy Prophet sent another
deputation of 40 (according to others, 70) preachers, consisting of
the Ansar young men, to Najd. But they were also betrayed. The people
of Usayyah and Ri'l and Dhakwan, tribes of Bani Sulaim, surrounded
them suddenly at Bir Maunah and slew all of them. Meanwhile the
Jewish tribe of Bani an-Nadir of Madinah, getting encouragement,
continued to commit breaches of the treaties; so much so that in
Rabi'ul Awwal, A.H. 4, they plotted against the life of the Holy
Prophet himself. Then in Jamadi al-Ula, A. H. 4, Bani Thalbah and
Bani Muharib, the two tribes of Bani Ghatafan, started making
preparations to attack Madinah and the Holy Prophet had to go to
punish them. Thus, after their setback at Uhud, the Muslims went on
encountering repercussions continuously for seven to eight months. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>However,
it was the Holy Prophet's determination and wisdom and his great
Companions' spirit of sacrifice that changed these adverse conditions
completely within a short span of time. The economic boycott by the
Arabs had made life hard for the people of Madinah. All the
polytheistic tribes around Madinah were becoming rebellious. Inside
Madinah itself the Jews and the hypocrites were beat upon mischief.
But the successive steps taken by a handful of the sincere Muslims,
under the leadership of the Holy Prophet, not only restored the image
of strength of Islam in Arabia but also increased it manifold. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<H2 STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Raids
Preceding the Battle of the Trench</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
first such step was taken immediately after the Battle of Uhud. The
very next day when quite a large number of Muslims lay wounded and
the martyrdom of the near and dear ones was being mourned in many
houses, and the Holy Prophet himself was injured and sad at the
martyrdom of his uncle, Hadrat Hamzah, he called out to the devoted
servants of Islam to accompany him in pursuit of the pagans so as to
deter them from returning and attacking Madinah again. The Holy
Prophet's assessment was absolutely correct. He knew that, although
the Quraish had retreated without taking any advantage of their
almost complete victory, they would certainly regret their folly when
they would halt and consider the whole matter coolly on the way, and
would return to attack Madinah again. Therefore, he decided to go in
pursuit of them, and 630 of of the Muslims at once volunteered to
accompany him. When they reached Hamra al-Asad on the way to Makkah
and camped there for three days, the Holy Prophet came to know
through a sympathetic non- Muslim that Abu Sufyan had stayed at
Ar-Rauha, 36 miles short of Madinah, with an army 2,978 strong: they
were regretting their error and were, in fact, planning to return and
attack Madinah once agaln. But when they heard that the Holy Prophet
was coming in pursuit of them with an army, they lost heart and gave
up their plan. Thus, not only were the Quraish deterred by this
action but the other enemies living around Madinah also realized that
the Muslims were being led by a person, who was highly well informed,
wise and resolute, and that the Muslims were ever ready to lay down
their lives at his command.(For further details, see Introduction to
Surah Al-i-`Imran and E.N. 122 thereof). </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
as soon as the Bani Asad started making Preparations for a raid on
Madinah, the Holy Prophet's secret agents gave him timely information
about their intention. Thus, before they could come in force to
attack Madinah, he sent an army 150 strong, under Hadrat Abu Salamah
(the first husband of Hadrat Umm Salamah) to punish them. They took
Bani Asad by surprise, who fled in panic leaving all their
possessions behind, which fell into the Muslim hands. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this came the turn of the Bani an-Nadir. The day they plotted against
the life of the Holy Prophet, and the secret was disclosed, the Holy
Prophet ordered them to leave Madinah within ten days and warned that
anyone who remained behind after that would be put to death. Abdullah
bin Ubayy, the chief of the hypocrites of Madinah, encouraged them to
defy the order and refuse to leave Madinah. He even promised to help
them with 2,000 men, and assured them that the Bani Ghatafan from
Najd also would come to their aid. Accordingly, the Bani an- Nadir
sent word that they would not leave no matter what the Holy Prophet
might do. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
soon as the time limit of ten days come to an end, the Holy Prophet
laid siege to their quarters, but none of their supporters had the
courage to come to their rescue. At last, they surrendered on
condition that every three of them would be allowed to load a camel
with whatever they could carry and go away leaving the rest of their
possessions behind. Thus, the whole suburbs of the city which were
inhabited by the Bani an-Nadir, and their gardens and their
fortresses and other properties fell to the Muslims, and the people
of this treacherous tribe became scattered in Khyber, Wad il Qura and
Syria. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
the Holy Prophet turned his attention to the Bani Ghatafan, who were
preparing for a war against Madinah. He took 400 of the Muslims and
overtook them at Dhat ar-Riqa. They were so taken by surprise that
they fled their houses without a struggle and took refuge in the
mountains. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this in Shaban A. H. 4, the Holy Prophet went forth to Badr to fight
Abu Sufyan. At the end of the Battle of Uhud, he had challenged the
Holy Prophet and the Muslims, saying, &quot;We shall again meet you
in combat at Badr next year.&quot; In reply the Holy Prophet
announced through a Companion: &quot;All right: we accept your
challenge.&quot; Accordingly, at the appointed time he reached Badr
with 1,500 of the Muslims. From the other side, Abu Sufyan left
Makkah with an army of 2,000 men, but could not have the courage to
march beyond Marr-az-Zahran (modern, Wadi Fatimah). The Holy Prophet
waited for him at Badr for eight days; the Muslims during these days
did profitable business with a trading party. This incident help- ed
more than restore the image of strength of the Muslims that had been
tarnished at Uhud. It also made the whole of Arabia realize that the
Quraish alone could no longer resist Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
peace and blessings). (Please also refer to E.N. 124 of Al-i-`Imran).
</FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
image and position of the Muslims was further strengthened by another
event. Dumat al-Jandal (modern, Al-Jauf) was an important place at
the border between Arabia and Syria. When the caravans of the Arabs,
trading between Iraq in the south and Syria and Egypt in the north,
passed that way, they were harassed and looted by the natives. In
Rabi al- Awwal, A. H. 5, the Holy Prophet himself went to punish them
with an army of 1,000 men. They could not muster up courage to come
out and fight him and, therefore, fled the place. This caused the
whole of northern Arabia to dread the power of Islam, and the tribes
began to realize that the great power emerging from Al-Madinah was
formidable and could no longer be resisted by one or a few of the
tribes. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<H2 STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>The
Battle of the Trench</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Such
were the conditions when the Battle of the Trench took place. It was
in fact a combined raid by many of the Arab tribes, who wanted to
crush the power of Madinah. It had been instigated by the leaders of
the Bani an-Nadir, who had settled in Khyber after their banishment
from Madinah. They went round to the Quraish and Ghatafan and Hudhail
and many other tribes and induced them to gather all their forces
together and attack Madinah jointly. Thus, in Shawwal, A. H. 5, an
unprecedentedly large army of the Arab tribes marched against the
small city of Madinah. From the north came Jews of Bani an-Nadir and
Bani Qainuqa who after their banishment from Madinah, had settled in
Khaiber and Wad il Qura. From the east advanced the tribes of
Ghatafan, Bani Sulaim, Fazarah, Murrah, Ashja, Sad, Asad, etc. and
from the south the Quraish, along with a large force of their allies.
Together they numbered from ten to twelve thousand men. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Had
it been a sudden attack, it would have been disastrous. But the Holy
Prophet was not unaware of this in Madinah. His intelligence men and
the sympathizers of the Islamic movement and the people influenced by
it were present in every tribe, who kept him informed of the enemy's
movements. Even before the enemy could reach his city, he got a
trench dug out on the north-west of Madinah in six days, and having
the Mount Salat their back, took up a defensive position with 3,000
men in the protection of the Trench. To the south of Madinah there
were many gardens (even now there are) so that it could not be
attacked from that side. To the east there are lava rocks which are
impassable for a large army. The same is the case with the south
western side. The attack, therefore, could be made only from the
eastern and western sides of the Uhud, which the Holy Prophet had
secured by digging a trench. The disbelievers were not at all aware
that they would have to counter the trench outside Madinah. This kind
of a defensive stratagem was unknown to the Arabs. Thus, they had to
lay a long siege in winter for which they had not come prepared. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this, only one alternative remained with the disbelievers: to incite
the Jewish tribe of Bani Quraizah, who inhabited the south eastern
part of the city, to rebellion. As the Muslims had entered a treaty
with them that in case of an attack on Madinah they would defend the
city along with them, the Muslims had made no defensive arrangement
there and had even sent their families to take shelter in the forts
situated on that side. The invaders perceived this weakness of the
Islamic defenses. They sent Huyayy bin Akhtab, the Jewish leader of
the Bani an-Nadir, to the Bani Quraizah so as to induce them to break
the treaty and join the war. In the beginning, they refused to oblige
and said that they had a treaty with Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
peace) who had faithfully abided by it and given them no cause for
complaint. But when Ibn Akhtab said to them, &quot;Look, I have
summoned the united force of entire Arabia against him: this is a
perfect opportunity to get rid of him. If you lose it, you will never
have another opportunity,&quot; the anti Islamic Jewish mind
prevailed over every moral consideration and the Bani Quraizah were
persuaded to break the treaty. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Holy Prophet received news of this. He at once told Sad bin Ubadah,
Sad bin Muadh, Abdullah bin Rawahah and Khawwat bin Jubair, chiefs of
the Ansar, to go and find out the truth. He advised them that if they
found Bani Quraizah still loyal to the treaty, they should return and
say so openly before the Muslim army; however, if they found that
they were bent upon treachery they should only inform him so that the
common Muslims would not be disheartened. On reaching there the
Companions found the Bani Quraizah fully bent on mischief They told
the Companions openly, &quot;There is no agreement and no treaty
between us and Muhammad.&quot; At this they returned to the Islamic
army and submitted their report to the Holy Prophet, saying, &quot;'Adal
and Qarah.&quot; That is, &quot;The Quraizah are bent upon doing what
the Adal and Qarah had done with the preachers of Islam at Raji.&quot;
</FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
news spread among the Muslims and caused great consternation among
them, for they had been encircled and their city had been endangered
on the side where there existed no defensive arrangement and where
they had also sent their families to take shelter in the forts. This
further increased the activities of the hypocrites and they started
making psychological attacks to break the morale of the Muslims. One
said, &quot;How strange! We were being foretold that the lands of
Caesar and Chosroes would fall to us, but here we are that not one of
us can go out even to relieve himself.&quot; Another one asked for
permission to leave his post at the Trench so that he could go and
protect his own house which was in danger. Another one started making
secret propaganda to the effect: &quot;Settle your affair with the
invaders yourselves and hand over Muhammad to them.&quot; This was a
highly critical hour of trial, which exposed every person who
harbored any hypocrisy in his heart. Only the true and sincere
Muslims remained firm and steadfast in their resolve and devotion. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the meantime Nuaim bin Masud, a member of the Ashja branch of the
Ghatafan tribe, became a Muslim and came before the Holy Prophet and
submitted: &quot;No one as yet knows that I have embraced Islam: You
can take from me whatever service you please.&quot; The Holy Prophet
replied: &quot;Go and sow the seeds of discord among the enemy.&quot;'
So, first of all, Nu'aim went to the Quraizah with whom he was on
friendly terms, and said to them, &quot;The Quraish and the Ghatafan
can become wearied of the siege and go back, and they will lose
nothing, but you have to live here with the Muslims. Just consider
what will be your position if the matter turns that way. Therefore, I
would advise you not to join the enemy until the outsiders should
send some of their prominent men as hostages to you.&quot; This had
the desired effect upon the Bani Quraizah and they decided to demand
hostages from the united front of the tribes. Then he went to the
chiefs of the Quraish and the Ghatafan and said to them, &quot;The
Bani Quraizah seem to be slack and irresolute. May be they demand
some men as hostage from you, and then hand them over to Muhammad
(upon whom be Allah's peace) to settle their affair with him.
Therefore, be very firm and cautious in your dealing with them.&quot;
This made the leaders of the united front suspicious of Bani
Quraizah. and they sent them a message, saying, &quot;We are tired of
the long siege; let there be a decisive battle; let us, therefore,
make a general assault simultaneously from both the sides.&quot; The
Bani Quraizah sent back the word, saying, &quot;We cannot afford to
join the war unless you hand over some of your prominent men to us as
hostages.&quot; The leaders of the united front became convinced that
what Nuaim had said was true. They refused to send hostages. And the
Bani Quraizah, on the other side, also felt that Nuaim had given them
the correct counsel. Thus, the strategy worked: it divided the enemy
against itself. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
siege was prolonged for more than 25 days. It was winter. The supply
of food and water and forage was becoming more and more scarce
everyday and division in the camp was also a great strain on the
state of morale of the besiegers. Then, suddenly one night a severe
windstorm accompanied by thunder and lightning hit the camp. It added
to the cold and darkness. The wind overthrew the tents and put the
enemy in disarray. They could not stand this severe blow of nature.
They left the battleground even during the night and returned to
their homes. When the Muslims awoke in the morning, there was not a
single enemy soldier to be seen on the battlefield. The Holy Prophet,
finding the battlefield completely empty, said: &quot;The Quraish
will never be able to attack you after this: now you will take the
offensive.&quot; This was a correct assessment of the situation. Not
only the Quraish but the united front of all the enemy tribes had
made their final assault against Islam and had failed. Now they could
no longer dare invade Madinah; now the Muslims were on the offensive.

on Bani Quraizah</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
the Holy Prophet returned from the Trench, Gabriel came to him in the
early afternoon with the Divine Command the the Muslims should not
lay aside the arms yet but should deal with the Bani Quraizah as
well. On receipt of this Command, the Holy Prophet got announced:
&quot;Everyone who is steadfast in obedience should not offer his Asr
Prayer till he reaches the locality of the Bani Quraizah.&quot;
Immediately after this, he dispatched Hadrat Ali with a contingent of
soldiers as vanguard towards the Quraizah. When they reached there,
the Jews climbed on to their roof tops and started hurling abuses on
the Holy Prophet and the Muslims, but their invectives could not save
them from the consequences of their treachery. They had committed
breach of the treaty right at the most critical moment of the war,
joined hands with the invaders and endangered the entire population
of Madinah. When they saw the contingent of Hadrat Ali, they thought
that they had come only to overawe them. But when the whole Islamic
army arrived under the command of the Holy Prophet himself and laid
siege to their quarters, they were very frightened. They could not
stand the severity of the siege for more than two or three weeks. At
last, they surrendered themselves to the Holy Prophet on the
condition that they would accept whatever decision Hadrat Sad bin
Muadh, the chief of the Aus, would give. They had accepted Hadrat Sad
as their judge because in the pre-Islamic days the Aus and the
Quraizah had been confederates and they hoped that in view of the
past ties he would help them quit Madinah as had happened in the case
of the Bani Qainuqa and the Bani an-Nadir before. The people of the
Aus themselves wished that Hadrat Sad treat their previous allies
leniently. But Hadrat Sad had just experienced and seen how the two
Jewish tribes who had been allowed to leave Madinah previously had
instigated the other tribes living around Madinah and summoned the
united front of ten to twelve thousand men against the Muslims. He
was also aware how treacherously this last Jewish tribe had behaved
right on the occasion when the city was under attack from outside and
threatened the safety of the whole of its population. Therefore, he
decreed that all the male members of the Quraizah should be put to
death, their women and children taken prisoners, and their properties
distributed among the Muslims. The sentence was carried out duly.
When the Muslims entered their strongholds they found that the
treacherous people had collected 1,500 swords, 300 coats of mail,
2,000 spears and 1,500 shields in order to join the war. If Allah's
succor had not reached the Muslims, all this military equipment would
have been used to attack Madinah from the rear right at the time when
the polytheists were making preparations for a general assault on the
Muslims after crossing the Trench. After this disclosure there
remained no doubt that the decision of Hadrat Sad concerning those
people was absolutely correct. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Reforms</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Though
the period of two years between the Battles of Uhud and the Trench
was a period of disturbance and turmoil and the Holy Prophet and his
Companions could hardly relax in peace and security even for a day,
the work of reform as a whole and the reconstruction of the Muslim
society continued uninterrupted. This was the time when the Islamic
laws pertaining to marriage and divorce were complemented; the law of
inheritance was introduced, drinking and gambling were prohibited,
and the new laws and regulations concerning many other aspects of the
economic and social life were enforced. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this connection, an important thing that needed to be reformed was
the question of the adoption of a son. Whoever was adopted by the
Arabs as a son was regarded as one of their own offspring: he got
share in inheritance; he was treated like a real son and real brother
by the adopted mother and the adopted sister; he could not marry the
daughter of his adopted father and his widow after his death. And the
same was the case if the adopted son died or divorced a wife. The
adopted father regarded the woman as his real daughter-in-law. This
custom clashed in every detail with the laws of marriage and divorce
and inheritance enjoined by Allah in Surahs Al-Baqarah and An-Nisa.
It made a person who could get no share in inheritance entitled to it
at the expense of those who were really entitled to it. It prohibited
marriage between the men and the women who could contract marriage
perfectly lawfully. And, above all, it helped spread the immoralities
which the Islamic Law wanted to eradicate. For a real mother and a
real sister and a real daughter cannot be like the adopted mother and
the adopted sister and the adopted daughter, however one may try to
sanctify the adopted relations as a custom. When the artificial
relations endued with customary sanctity are allowed to mix freely
like the real relations, it cannot but produce evil results. That is
why the Islamic law of marriage and divorce, the law of inheritance
and the law of the prohibition of adultery required that the concept
and custom of regarding the adopted son as the real son should be
eradicated completely. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
concept, however, could not be rooted out by merely passing a legal
order, saying, The adopted son is not the real son. The centuries old
prejudices and superstitions cannot be changed by mere word of mouth.
Even if the people had accepted the command that these relations were
not the real relations, they would still have looked upon marriage
between the adopted mother and the adopted son, the adopted brother
and the sister, the adopted father and the daughter, and the adopted
father- in-law and the daughter-in- law odious and detestable.
Moreover, there would still exist some freedom of mixing together
freely. Therefore, it was inevitable that the custom should be
eradicated practically, and through the Holy Prophet himself. For no
Muslim could ever conceive that a thing done by the Holy Prophet
himself, and done by him under Allah's Command, could be detestable.
Therefore, a little before the Battle of the Trench, the Holy Prophet
was inspired by Allah that he should marry the divorced wife of his
adopted son, Zaid bin Harithah (may Allah be pleased with him), and
he acted on this Command during the siege of the Bani Quraizah. (The
delay probably was caused for the reason that the prescribed waiting
period had not yet ended, and in the meantime the Holy Prophet had to
become busy in the preparation for war). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

of Propaganda at the Marriage of Hadrat Zainab</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
soon as the marriage was contracted, there arose a storm of
propaganda against the Holy Prophet. The polytheists, the hypocrites
and the Jews, all were burning with jealousy at his triumphs which
followed one after the other. The way they had been humbled within
two years after Uhud, in the Battle of the Trench, and in the affair
of the Quraizah, had made them sore at heart. They had also lost hope
that they could ever subdue him on the battlefield. Therefore, they
seized the question of this marriage as a god send for themselves and
thought they would put an end to his moral superiority, which was the
real secret of his power and success. Therefore, stories were
concocted that Muhammad, God forbid, had fallen in love with his
daughter-in-law, and when the son had come to know of this, he
divorced his wife, and the father married his daughter-in-law. The
propaganda, however, was absurd on the face of it. Hadrat Zainab was
the Holy Prophet's first cousin. He had known her from childhood to
youth. So, there could be no question of his falling in love with her
at first sight. Then he himself had arranged her marriage with Hadrat
Zaid under his personal influence, although her whole family had
opposed it. They did not like that a daughter of the noble Quraish
should be given in marriage to a freed slave. Hadrat Zainab herself
was not happy at this arrangement. But everyone had to submit to the
Holy Prophet's command. The marriage was solemnized and a precedent
was set in Arabia that Islam had raised a freed slave to the status
of the Quraishite nobility. If the Holy Prophet had in reality any
desire for Hadrat Zainab, there was no need of marrying her to Hadrat
Zaid; he himself could have married her. But in spite of all this,
the shameless opponents invented stories of love, spread them with
great exaggeration and publicized them so vehemently that even some
Muslims also began to accept them as true. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There
were two other problems which needed attention at that time. Though
apparently they pertained to the Holy Prophet's domestic life, it was
necessary to resolve them for the domestic and mental peace of the
person, who was exerting every effort to promote the cause of Allah's
Religion and was day and night absorbed in this great mission.
Therefore, Allah took these two problems also officially in His own

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
first problem was that economically the Holy Prophet at that time was
in straitened circumstances. During the first four years he had no
source of income whatever. In 4 A. H. after the banishment of the
Bani an-Nadir, a portion of their evacuated lands was reserved for
his use by the Command of Allah, but it was not enough for his family
requirements. On the other hand, the duties of the office of
Prophethood were so onerous that they were absorbing all his energies
of the mind and body and heart and every moment of his time, and he
could not make any effort at all for earning his livelihood. In
conditions such as these when his wives happened to disturb his
mental peace because of economic hardships he would feel doubly
strained and taxed. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
other problem was that before marrying Hadrat Zainab, he had four
wives already in the houses: Hadrat Saudah, Hadrat Aishah, Hadrat
Hafsah, and Hadrat Umm Salamah. Hadrat Zainab was his fifth wife. At
this the opponents raised the objection, and the Muslims also started
entertaining doubts, that as for others it had been forbidden to keep
more than four wives at a time, but how the Holy Prophet himself had
taken a fifth wife also. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	regarding the adopted relations, and that he should take the
	initiative and marry the divorced wife of his adopted son (Zaid) so
	that the custom was completely eradicated. But the reason why he was
	hesitant in this regard was the fear that this would provide a
	strong excuse to the disbelievers and the hypocrites; who were
	already burning with jealousy at his successive victories, to start
	a propaganda campaign against him. This fear was not due to any
	apprehension for personal defamation, but for the reason that it

	who were inclined towards it; it would make the neutral people to
	join the enemy; and it would cause the weak-minded people among the
	Muslims themselves to be involved in doubts and suspicions.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote13sym" HREF="#sdfootnote13anc">13</A>On
	the basis of the special relationship mentioned above, another
	characteristic of the Holy Prophet is that his wives are forbidden
	to the Muslims just like their own real mothers although their
	adopted mothers are in no sense their real mothers. This thing is
	peculiar only to the person of the Holy Prophet and of no other man
	in the world. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, one should also know that the wives of the Holy Prophet
	are mothers of the believers only in the sense that the Muslims are
	under obligation to have reverence and respect for them, and no
	Muslim could marry them. As for other matters they are not like the
	mothers. For example, apart from their real relatives, all other
	Muslims were non-mahram for them from whom they had to observe
	Purdah; their daughters were not like real sisters for the Muslims,
	so that no Muslim could marry them; their brothers and sisters were
	not like the maternal uncles and aunts for the Muslims; they could
	not be inherited by a Muslim, unless a close relative, as a mother
	is inherited by her son. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	noteworthy point in this connection is that according to the Qur'an,
	this status accrues to all the wives of the Holy Prophet among whom
	Hadrat 'A'ishah is also included. But, when a section (of the
	Muslims) made Hadrat `AIi and Fatimah (may Allah be pleased with
	them) and their children the center of their Faith and made the
	whole system of religion revolve around them, and made Hadrat
	`A'ishah also, along with many other Companions, the target of curse
	and abuse, this verse became a hindrance for them, for according to
	it every person who claims to be a believer has to acknowledge her
	as his mother. Consequently, to overcome this difficulty a strange
	claim was made to the effect: The Holy Prophet had given Hadrat 'Ali
	the authority that after his death he could allow any of his wives
	he liked to retain her position of the holy wife and divorce any
	other on his behalf. Abu Mansur Ahmad bin Abu Talib Tabrasi has
	written this in Kitab al-Ihtijaj and Suleman bin `Abdullah
	al-Bahrani has related that the Holy Prophet said to Hadrat `Ali &quot;O
	Abul Hasan: this honor will last till the time that we remain
	steadfast on obedience to Allah. Therefore, you may divorce any of
	my wives, who after me disobeys Allah by revolting against you, and
	deprive her of the honor that belongs to the mothers of the
	faithful. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is a
	false -tradition even according to the principles of reporting
	Hadith. But if one studies vv. 28-29 and 51-52 of this very Surah
	Al-Ahzab itself, one finds that this tradition goes against the
	Qur'an as well. For after the revelation of the &quot;verse of the
	option&quot; (v. 29), the Holy Prophet's right of divorce against
	those of his wives who chose to remain with him through every
	difficulty had been curtailed. For further explanation, see E.N.'s
	42 and 93 below. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Moreover,
	if an unbiased person only uses his common sense and considers this
	tradition carefully, he will find that it is utterly absurd and
	highly derogatory in respect to the Holy Prophet. The rank and
	position of the Messenger of Allah is very high and exalted. It
	cannot even be expected of an ordinary man that he would think of
	divorcing his wife after his death and on leaving the world would
	authorize his son-in-law to divorce her on his behalf if there arose
	a dispute between him and her in the future. This shows what regard
	these sectarians have for the honor and reverence of the Holy
	Prophet himself; and even for the Divine Law.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote14">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote14sym" HREF="#sdfootnote14anc">14</A>The
	verse means this: As for the' Holy Prophet the nature of the
	Muslims' relationship with him is unique. Hut as far as the common
	Muslims are concerned, their mutual relationship will be based on
	the principle that the rights of the relatives on one another are
	given priority over the rights of others. No charity is right if a
	person overlooks the needs and requirements of his own parents and
	children and brothers and sisters, and gives away charities to
	others: The Zakat money also will be used first of all to help one's
	own poor relatives and then the other needy people. The inheritance
	will necessarily be divided among those who are nearest in relation
	to the deceased. As for others, the dying person may give them a
	part of his wealth as a gift or by trust and will. But in no case is
	he allowed to deprive his rightful heirs and give away everything to
	others. After this Divine Command the system of &quot;Brotherhood&quot;
	that had been established between the Muhajirin and the Ansar after
	the Hijrah also became abolished, for according to it the Muhajirin
	and the Ansar became heirs to one another only on the basis of their
	relationship of being the brethren in faith. Allah enjoined the law
	that inheritance will be divided only on the basis of blood
	relationship; however, a person could help his brother-in-faith by
	making him a gift or through a will if he so liked.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote15sym" HREF="#sdfootnote15anc">15</A>Allah
	in this verse has reminded the Holy Prophet that, like all other
	Prophets, He has taken from him too a solemn covenant which he
	should abide by strictly. A study of the preceding verse shows that
	the Covenant implies: &quot;The Prophet will first himself obey and
	follow every Command received from Allah, and then make others also
	to obey and follow it: he will convey Allah's Commands intact to
	others and will show no laxity in the struggle to enforce them
	practically.&quot; This Covenant has been mentioned at several other
	places in the Quran, e.g. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)&quot;He
	has appointed for you the same way of life whim he appointed for
	Noah and which (O Muhammad,) We have now revealed to you, and which
	We had already enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus, stressing :
	`Establish this Way and be not divided in it.&quot; (Ash-Shura:13). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) &quot;And
	remember that Allah had made the Covenant with the people who had
	been given the Scripture, and enjoined: `You shall spread the
	teachings of the Book among the people and shall not conceal them. &quot;
	(Al`Imran: 187). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)&quot;Remember
	that We made a solemn Covenant with the children of Israel to the
	effect: `Worship (and submit to) none save Allah.&quot; (AI-Baqarah:
	83). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) &quot;Has
	not the Covenant of the Book been taken from them.. .: `Hold fast
	the Book We have given you, and keep in mind what it contains: it is
	expected that you will refrain from wrong ways.&quot; (Al-A'raf:
	169-171). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) &quot;Keep
	in mind the blessing Allah has bestowed on you and do not forget the
	solemn Covenant which He made with you, when you said, `We have
	heard and submitted.' &quot; (A1-Ma`idah: 7) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	reason why Allah is reminding of this Covenant in this context is
	that the Holy Prophet was feeling hesitant to break the custom of
	ignorance in respect of the adopted relations due to the
	apprehension that the enemies of Islam would put him to a
	disadvantage. He was feeling shy time and again at the thought: The
	question is of marrying a woman. I may take this initiative with the
	purest intention only for the sake of a social reform, but the
	enemies will certainly say that I have done so for the purpose of
	satisfying my sensual desires, and I am in fact trying to deceive
	others under the guise of a reformer. That is why Allah assures him,
	saying: &quot;You arc a Prophet appointed by Us. Like all other
	Prophets, you also are bound in the Covenant that you will carry out
	whatever Command We give yourself and command others to follow it.
	Therefore, you should not bother at all about taunts and derision by
	others, do dot be afraid and fight shy of others, and carry out
	without hesitation the service that We want to take from you.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A section
	of the people think that this Covenant is the covenant that was
	taken from all the Prophets and their communities, who came before
	the Holy Prophet, to the effect that they would believe in the
	Prophet who came afterwards and cooperate with him. On the basis of
	this interpretation they claim that the door to Prophethood is still
	open after the Holy Prophet and this covenant has been taken from
	the Holy Prophet too, that his followers will believe in the prophet
	who will come after him. But the context in which the verse occurs
	is explicit that this interpretation is absolutely wrong, There is
	no occasion whatever in the context to indicate that other prophets
	will come also after the Holy Prophet and his followers should
	believe in them. If the verse is read in this sense, it becomes
	irrelevant and incoherent. Moreover, there is no indication in the
	words of the verse to show which covenant is implied here.
	Therefore, to find out the nature of the covenant, we shall have to
	turn to other verses of the Qur'an in which mention has been made of
	the covenants taken from the Prophets. Now, if only one sort of the
	covenants had been mentioned in the entire Qur'an, i.e., the
	covenant that the people shall believe in the prophets coming
	afterwards, it would be correct to think that here also the covenant
	implied the same covenant. But anyone who has studied the Qur'an
	with an open mind knows that it has mentioned many covenants, which
	were taken from the Prophets and their followers. Therefore, only
	that covenant from among the different covenant would be implied
	here, which fitted in with the context here, and not the one which
	was altogether irrelevant. Such wrong interpretations reveal the
	mentality of the people who wish to draw no guidance from the Qur'an
	but want to reinterpret it instead.&nbsp;

	endured along with others every toil and labor that he asked others
	to endure, and endured better than others; there was no trouble
	which others might have experienced and he himself did. not. He was
	among those who dug the trench, and endured hunger and other
	afflictions just as the common Muslims did. He did not leave the
	battlefront even for a moment during the siege nor retreated an
	inch. After the betrayal of the Bani Quraizah his own family had
	also been exposed to danger even as the families of the other
	Muslims were. He did not make any special arrangement for his own
	and his family's protection, which did not exist for others. He was
	always in the forefront to offer maximum sacrifices for the great

	one should keep verse 12 in view. There it was said that when the
	hypocrites and the people with diseased hearts found themselves
	surrounded by a huge force of ten to twelve thousand men from the
	front and by the Bani Quraizah from behind, they openly started
	saying: &quot;The promises that Allah and His Messenger had made
	with us were nothing but a delusion. We were promised that if we
	believed in Allah's religion, His succor would be at our back and we
	would rule Arabia and the world outside and all the wealth of Caesar
	and Chosroes will be ours, but here we are that the whole of Arabia
	is bent upon exterminating us, and there is no sign yet of the
	armies of the angels in sight, who would save us and protect us
	against this grave calamity.&quot; Now they are being told: &quot;One
	meaning of the promise of Allah and His Messenger was that which was
	understood by these false claimants to faith. The other meaning is
	that which is understood by the sincere and true Muslims. When they
	saw the storms of danger gathering, they too remembered the promises
	of Allah, but these promises did not mean that as soon as they
	affirmed the faith they would overwhelm and subdue the whole world
	without the slightest effort, and the angels would come to perform
	their coronation, but the promises actually meant that they would
	have to pass through severe trials, endure extreme hardships and
	afflictions, offer supreme sacrifices; then only will Allah bless
	them with His grace and they will be granted successes of the world
	and the Hereafter, which Allah has promised His believing servants.

	is, &quot;On seeing the hard, times of affliction approaching they
	did not waver in their faith but were strengthened in it all the
	mote, and instead of giving up Allah's obedience they became ready
	to resign and surrender to Him whatever they had with complete
	conviction and satisfaction of the heart. &quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, one
	should fully understand that faith and resignation is indeed a
	quality of the self which is put to trial and test at every command
	and demand of the Faith. At every step in life man comes across
	situations where the Faith either enjoins something or forbids
	something, or requires one to make sacrifices of life and wealth and
	time and desires of the self. At every such occasion the faith and
	conviction of the person who deviates from obedience will suffer
	decline and the faith and conviction of him who submits to the
	command and demand will be strengthened and enhanced. Although in
	the beginning a man becomes a believer and Muslim only by embracing
	the fundamental creed (Kalimah) of Islam, yet his state of faith
	does not remain static but is open to both deterioration and
	development. Decline in sincerity and the spirit of obedience causes
	it to deteriorate; so much so that constant retrogression may cause
	the person to reach the last limits of the faith where the slightest
	move backward may turn him from a believer to a hypocrite. Contrary
	to this, the more sincere a person is, the more perfect his
	obedience and the greater his devotion and dedication to the cause
	of the true Faith, the stronger and more sound will he grow in faith
	and may even attain the supreme rank of the truthful. But this
	increase and decrease in the faith has only the moral significance
	which can be judged and reckoned by none but Allah. As for the man,
	faith is simply the act of affirmation by which a Muslim enters
	Islam and is regarded as a Muslim as long as he remains steadfast to
	it. In this regard we cannot say that so and so is half a Muslim, or
	one-third a Muslim, and another one double a Muslim or triple a
	Muslim. Likewise, in legal rights the Muslims are equal and alike.
	It cannot be that one is regarded a greater believer and given more
	rights and another one a lesser believer and given less rights. In
	these aspects there can be no question of the increase and decrease
	in the faith, and in fact, in this very sense has Imam Abu Hanifah
	said: &quot;Faith in Islam neither increases nor decreases. &quot;&nbsp;

	verses from here to 35 were sent down in the period contiguous to
	the Battle of the Trench and the raid on Bani Quraizah, whose
	background we have touched upon in the Introduction to this Surah.
	According to a tradition related in Muslim on the authority of
	Hadrat Jabir bin `Abdullah, &quot;One day when Hadrat Abu Bakr and
	Hadrat 'Umar visited the Holy Prophet, they saw that his wives were
	sitting around him and he was quiet. Addressing Hadrat `Umar, he
	said: `They are sitting around me as you see: they are asking for
	money for household expenditure'.&quot; At this both the Companions
	rebuked their daughters and said, &quot;Why do you embarrass the
	Holy Prophet and demand from him that which he does not have.&quot;
	This event shows how hard pressed the Holy Prophet was economically
	at that time and how distressed and embarrassed he was feeling at
	his wives' demand for domestic expenditure during the period when a
	bitter conflict was going on between Islam and paganism.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote42">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote42sym" HREF="#sdfootnote42anc">42</A>At
	the time when this verse was sent down, the Holy Prophct had four
	wives with him: Hadrat Saudah, Hadrat 'A'ishah, Hadrat Hafsah and
	Hadrat Umm Salamah. He had not yet married Hadrat Zainab. (Ibn
	`Arabia Ahkam ai-Qur an. Egyptian Edition, 1958, vol. III, pp.
	512-13). When this verse was revealed, he first spoke to Hadrat
	'A'ishah, and said: &quot;I ask you a thing; do not be hasty in
	answering; consult your parents, then decide.&quot; Then he told her
	of Allah's Command and recited this verse. She replied: &quot;Should
	I consult my parents about this?-I seek Allah and His Messenger and
	the Hereafter. After this he went to each of his wives and asked the
	same thing and each one gave the same reply as had been given by
	Hadrat `A'ishah. (Musnad Ahmad, Muslim, Nasa'i). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is
	termed takhyir, i. e. to give the wife the option to decide for
	herself whether she would stay in wedlock or would separate from the
	husband. This was obligatory for the Holy Prophet because he had
	been commanded by Allah to offer such an option to his wives. If a
	lady from among the holy wives had opted to separate she would not
	have separated automatically but would have been separated by the
	Holy Prophet, as is clear from the words: &quot; . . . I shall give
	you of these and send you off gracefully.&quot; But the Holy Prophet
	would certainly have separated her because as a Prophet it would not
	behoove him not to honor the word. After divorce apparently the lady
	would have stood excluded from the category of the holy wives, and
	she would not be forbidden to any other Muslim; for she would have
	chosen divorce from the Holy Prophet only for the sake of the world
	and its adornments of which she had been given the choice, and
	obviously the option could not be exercised in case she was
	forbidden to re-marry. On the other hand, the intention of the verse
	also seems that the Holy Prophet was not left with any authority to
	divorce the wives who chose Allah and His Messenger and the
	Hereafter in preference to the world. For takhyir had only two
	sides: if a wife opted for the world, she would be divorced; if she
	opted for Allah and His Messenger and the Hereafter, she would not
	be divorced. Obviously, if a lady chose one alternative, the other
	would become forbidden in her case by itself. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In
	Islamic Law takhyir. in fact, amounts to delegation of the right to
	obtain divorce. The husband himself gives the wife the choice to
	stay in wedlock with him or be separated. Here are briefly the
	injunctions which the jurists have derived from the Qur'an and
	Sunnah in this regard: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) Once
	a husband has given this choice to a wife, he can neither withdraw
	it nor stop her from exercising it. However, it is not necessary
	that the woman must exercise it. She may choose to remain in wedlock
	with the husband, or may prefer to separate, or may opt nothing and
	let the right of divorce be annulled. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) There
	are two conditions of this choice being transferred to the woman:
	(a) The husband should have given her the right of divorce in clear
	words, or if there was no clear mention of the divorce, he should
	have had the intention of giving this right; e.g. if he says, &quot;You
	have the choice&quot; or &quot;your business is in your own hand,&quot;
	such indirect words will not transfer the right of divorce to the
	woman without the intention of the husband. If the woman claims it
	and the husband states on oath that he had no intention of giving
	the right of divorce, his statement will be admitted, unless the
	woman produces evidence to the effect that those words were said
	during a dispute, or in connection with divorce, because in that
	context delegation of the right would mean that the husband had the
	intention of giving the right of divorce. (b) The woman knows that
	she has been given the right of divorce. If she was absent, she
	should receive information of this, and if she is present, she
	should hear the words. Unless she hears the words, or receives the
	news, the right will not be transferred to her. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) As to
	the time limit within which the wife has to exercise her right if
	the husband gives it her absolutely without specifying any limit,
	there is a difference of opinion among the jurists. Some jurists
	have expressed the opinion that the woman can exercise the right at
	the same sitting at which the husband gave it her; if she leaves the
	place without making a response, or turns her attention to something
	else which indicates that she does not want to make a response, she
	forfeits the right invested in her and her choice no longer remains.
	This is the opinion of Hadrat `Umar, Hadrat `Uthman, Hadrat Ibn.
	Mas`ud, Hadrat Jabir bin `Abdullah, `Atta, Jabir bin Zaid, Mujahid,
	Sha'bi, Nakha`i, Imam Malik, Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Shafe`i, Imam
	Auza`i, Sufyan Thauri `and Abu Thaur. The other opinion is that her
	exercise of the choice is not confined to that sitting but she can
	exercise it even afterwards. This opinion is held by Hadrat Hasan
	Basri, Qatadah and Zuhri. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) If
	the husband specifies a time limit and says, for instance, &quot;You
	have the option for a month or a year, or your business is in your
	own hand for so long,&quot; the wife would enjoy the option only for
	that long. However, if he says, &quot;You can exercise this option
	as and when you like,&quot; her option would be unlimited. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) If
	the woman intends to obtain separation, she should express her
	intention clearly and definitely. Vague words which do not express
	the intention clearly will have no effect. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6)
	Legally, the husband can give the option to the waft in three forms:
	(a) He may say, &quot;Your business is in your own hand;&quot; or
	(b) he may say: &quot;You have the option; &quot; or (c) &quot;You
	are divorced if you so please. &quot; The legal consequences of each
	arc separate as explained below: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a) If
	the husband has said: &quot;Your business is in your own hand,&quot;
	and the woman responds clearly to the effect that she would opt for
	separation, it would amount to an irreversible divorce according to
	the Hanafites. That is, after this the husband will forfeit his
	right to have her back as his wife. However, they can remarry if
	they so like after the expiry of the waiting period. And if the
	husband said, &quot;Your affair is in your own hand to the extent of
	one divorce,&quot; this will be regarded as the first reversible
	divorce. That is, the husband can take her back as his wife within
	the waiting-period. But if the husband had the intention of all the
	three divorces at the time of delegating to the woman the right of
	divorce, or mentioned this specifically, the woman's exercise of the
	option in such a case would amount to divorce no matter whether she
	pronounces divorce thrice on herself or says only once that she has
	chosen separation or divorced herself. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b) If
	the husband gives the woman the option to separate with the words:
	&quot;You have the option,&quot; and the woman opts for separation
	in clear words, it will amount to one reversible divorce according
	to the Hanafites even if the husband had the intention of giving
	option for three divorces. However, if the husband has clearly given
	option for three divorces, the three divorces will take place only
	on the woman's exercise of the option for divorce. According to Imam
	Shafe'i, if at the time of giving the option, the husband had the
	intention of divorce, and the woman opts for separation, it will
	amount to one reversible divorce. According to Imam Malik, it will
	amount to three divorces in case the wife had been enjoyed; in case
	she had not been enjoyed, the husband's claim to have intended only
	one divorce will be admitted. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(c) In
	case the words &quot;You are divorced if you so please&quot; have
	been used and the woman has opted for divorce, it will be a
	reversible divorce and not an irreversible one. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) If
	after the husband has given the option for separation, the woman
	chooses to remain in wedlock, no divorce will take place at all.
	This is the opinion of Hadrat 'Umar, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud,
	Hadrat 'A'ishah, Hadrat Abu ad-Darda, Ibn `Abbas and Ibn `Umar, and
	the same has been adopted by majority of the jurists. When Masruq
	asked Hadrat `A'ishah about this, she replied: &quot;The Holy
	Prophet had given his wives the option and they chose to continue to
	live as his wives. Then, was it deemed to be a divorce?&quot; The
	opinion of Hadrat `Ali and Zaid bin Thabit that has been reported in
	this regard is that one reversible divorce will take place. But
	according to another tradition these two great Companions also held
	the opinion that no divorce will take place at all.

	reason for giving a double punishment for a sin and a double reward
	for a good work is that those whom Allah honors with a high rank in
	society generally become the leaders of men and the majority of the
	people follow them for good or for evil. Thus, their evil does not
	remain their own evil but becomes the cause of a people's
	degeneration, and their goodness does not remain them own goodness
	but becomes the cause of the true success of many other people also.
	Therefore, when they commit evil they are punished for their own as

	guided others also to do good.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This

	prohibition and trust in respect of somebody and something the
	greater and more serious will be the crime of violating that
	prohibition and trust and the greater will be the punishment for it.
	For example, drinking in the mosque is a much more serious crime
	than drinking privately in the house, and therefore, it will entail
	a severer punishment. Likewise, committing adultery with the
	prohibited relations is a far more serious crime than committing it

	verses from here to the end of the paragraph are those with which
	the Commandments of Purdah were introduced in Islam. In these verses
	though the wives of the Holy Prophet only have been addressed, the
	intention is to enforce reforms in all the Muslim houses. The object
	of addressing the Holy Prophet's wives particularly is that when a
	pure way of life will start from his house, it will be followed by
	the women of all other Muslim houses as well, because this house was
	looked upon by the Muslims as a model to follow. Some people, when
	they see that these verses have been addressed only to the wives of
	the Holy Prophet, assert that these Commandments were only meant for
	them. But when one reads what follows in these verses one feels that
	there is nothing which might have been meant particularly for the
	holy wives and not for the other Muslim women. Could Allah have
	intended only this that the holy wives alone should be fret from
	uncleanliness and they alone should obey Allah and His Prophet and
	they alone should offer the Salat and pay the Zakat? If this could
	not be the intention, then how could the Command for them to stay in
	their houses and avoid displaying the fineries and abstain from
	talking to the other men in an alluring voice be meant particularly

	could cherish any false hope from her. There should be no undue
	softness in her tone, no allurement in her conversation, no

	the male hearer's emotions and encourage him to make advances. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">About
	such a manner of speech Allah clearly says that this does not
	behoove a woman who has any fear of God in her heart and desire to
	avoid evil. In other words, this is the way and manner of the wicked
	and unchaste woman's speech and not of the believing pious woman's
	speech: If this verse is read together with verse 31 of Surah
	An-Nur, in which Allah says: &quot;They should not stamp the ground
	in walking lest their hidden decoration is revealed,&quot; the
	intention of the Lord clearly seems to be that the women should not
	attract other men by their voice or the jingle of their ornaments
	unnecessarily and if at all they have to speak to the other men,
	they should speak to them in an un-affected tone and manner. That is
	why it is forbidden for the woman to pronounce the call to the
	Prayer. Moreover, if a woman is attending a congregational Prayer
	and the Imam commits a mistake, she is not permitted to say
	Subhan-Allah like the males but should only tap her hands to call
	the imam's attention to the error.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now just
	consider this: When Islam disallows the woman to talk to other men
	in a soft and sweet tone and even forbids her to produce her voice
	before the other men without a genuine need, will it approve her to
	appear on the stage and sing, dance, flirt and behave coquettishly?
	Will it permit her to sing love songs over the radio and excite the
	people's emotions by presenting sweet melodies full of obscene
	themes? Will it permit that she should play the roles of the wives
	and sweet-hearts of others in dramas? Or that the women should be
	made the air hostesses and be especially trained to charm and allure
	the passengers? Or that they should visit clubs and attend social
	functions and gatherings in full make-up and mix freely with men and
	have fun and a good time with them? From which Qur'an has this

	word qarna in the original is derived from qarar according to some

	activity is her home; she should carry out her functions within that
	sphere peacefully, and she should come out of the house only in case
	of a genuine need. This meaning is clear from the words of the verse

	they fight and accomplish great deeds in the way of Allah. What
	should we do that we may also get a reward equal to that of the
	warriors?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied: The one who sits in her
	house from among you; will attain the reward of the warriors.&quot;
	What he meant was : The warrior can fight confidently and with full
	peace of the mind in the way of Allah only when he is sure that all
	is well at home: his wife is there to look after the house and the
	children, and there is no cause for him to worry that she will
	betray him in his absence. The woman who will provide him this
	satisfaction and peace of the mind will be an equal partner with him
	in his fighting though she will be sitting back at home. According
	to another tradition that Bazzar and Tirmidhi have related on the
	authority of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas`ud, the Holy Prophet said:
	`The woman must remain veiled and concealed. When she comes out of
	her house, Satan stares at her. And she is closer to Allah's mercy
	when she is inside her house.&quot; (For further details, see E.N.
	49 of Surah An-Nur). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	presence of such a clear and express command of the Qur'an, it is
	not at all permissible that the Muslim women should seek membership
	of the councils and parliaments; that they should run after social
	activities outside the house; that they should work side by side
	with men in the government offices, should get education along with
	boys in the colleges, serve as nurses in the male wards of
	hospitals, should be employed as hostesses in the airplanes and rail
	cars, and should be sent abroad for education and training. The
	greatest argument that is given in support of the permissibility of
	the women's outdoor activities is that Hadrat 'A'ishah had taken
	part in the Battle of the Camel. But the people who present this
	argument perhaps do not know what was Hadrat `A'ishah's own opinion
	in this regard. `Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal has related in his
	Zawa id az-Zuhd and Ibn Mundhir, Ibn Abi Shaibah and Ibn Sa'd in
	their own books the tradition from Masruq, saying that when Hadrat
	`A'ishah during her recitation of the Qur'an would reach this verse
	(wa qarna fi buyut-i kunna), she would start crying involuntarily;
	so much so that her head-wrapper would become wet, for this reminded
	her of the error that she had committed in the Battle of the Camel.&nbsp;

	this verse two important words have been used, which must be
	understood for the proper understanding of its intention. They are
	tabarruj and jahiliyyat al-ula. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The word
	tabarruj in Arabic means to become manifest and appear openly before
	others. The Arabs use the word baraj for every conspicuous and
	elevated object. A burj (tower) is so called because of its
	prominence and elevation. A sailing-boat is called barijah, because
	its sails become visible from a distance. The word tabarruj when
	used in respect of a woman will have three meanings: (1) that she
	should show the charms of her face and body before the people; (2)
	that she should display the adornments of her dress and ornaments
	before others; and (3) that she should make herself conspicuous by
	her gait and figure and coquetry. The same explanation of this word
	has been given by the leading lexicographers and commentators.
	Mujahid, Qatadah and Ibn Abi Nujaih say: &quot;Tabarruj means to
	walk in a vain, alluring and coquettish manner.&quot; Muqatil says:
	&brvbar;It means a woman's displaying of her necklaces, ear-rings
	and bosom. &quot; AI-Mubarrad says: &quot;That a woman should reveal
	her adornments which she should conceal. &quot; Abu 'Ubaidah
	comments: &quot;This that a woman should make herself conspicuous by
	display of her body and dress to attract the attention of men.&quot;
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The word
	jahiliyyat has been used at three other places in the Quran besides
	this, in Al-i `Imran: 154, where about those who shirk fighting in
	the way of Allah, it has been said: &brvbar;They began to cherish
	about Allah thoughts of Ignorance Uahiljyyat) which were void of the
	truth,&quot; and in Al-Ma`idah: 50, where about those who want to be
	judged by their own law instead of the law of Allah, it has been
	said: &quot;Do they desire to be judged by the laws of ignorance
	(Jahiliyyat)?&quot; and in Al-Fath: 26, where the prejudice of the
	people of Makkah due to which they did not permit the Muslims to
	perform 'Umrah, has been called as &quot;the haughty spirit of
	paganism ( jahiliyyat). &quot; According to a Hadith once Hadrat Abu
	ad-Darda' in the heat of a quarrel abused another person in respect
	of his mother. When the Holy Prophet heard of it, he remarked: &quot;You
	still have jahiliyyat in you. &quot; According to another Hadith the
	Holy Prophet said: &quot;Three things show jahiliyyat to taunt the
	lineage of another person, to take omens from the movement of the
	stars, and to mourn over the dead. &quot; All these customs show
	that jahiliyyat in the Islamic terminology is every such conduct
	which goes against Islamic culture and civilization and Islamic
	morality and etiquette and Islamic way of thinking and behavior.
	Thus, jahiliyyat al-ula would mean all those evils in which the
	Arabs of the pre-Islamic days and the people of the entire world
	were involved. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	explanation makes it abundantly clear that what Allah forbids women
	is to move out of their houses showing off their physical charms and
	beauty. He instructs them to stay in their houses because their real
	sphere of activity is their home and not the world outside. However,
	if they have to move out of the house for an cut-door duty, they
	should not move out as the women used to do in the pre-Islamic days
	of ignorance. For it does not behoove the women of a Muslim society
	to walk out fully embellished to make their face and figure
	conspicuous by adornments and tight-fitting or transparent dresses,
	and to walk coquettishly. These are the ways of ignorance which
	Islam does not approve. Now everybody can see for himself whether
	the culture which is being made popular in our country is the
	culture of Islam, according to the Qur'an, or the culture of
	ignorance.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote50">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote50sym" HREF="#sdfootnote50anc">50</A>The
	context in which this verse occurs makes it manifest that the word
	ahl al-bait (people of the house) here implies the wives of the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace), because the address begins
	with: &quot;O wives of the Prophet,&quot; and they are the
	addressees in the whole discourse preceding it as well as following
	it. Moreover, the word ahl al-bait in Arabic is used precisely in
	the sense in which the word &quot;household&quot; is used in
	English, which includes both a man's wife and children. No one would
	exclude the wife from the &quot;household.&quot; The Qur'an itself
	has used this word at two other places besides this, and at both the
	wife is included in its sense, rather as the most important member
	of the family. In Surah Hud, whcn the angels give the Prophet
	Abraham the good news of the birth of a son, his wife exclaims:
	&quot;Shall I bear a child now when I have grown too old, and this
	husband of mine has also become old?&quot; The angels say: What! Are
	you surprised at Allah's decree, O people of Abraham's household?
	Allah's mercy and blessings are upon you.&quot; In Surah Al-Qasas,
	whcn the Prophet Moses reaches the Pharaoh's house as a suckling,
	and the Pharaoh's wife is in search of a suitable nurse for the
	child, the Prophet Moses' sister says, &quot;Shall I tell you of a
	household whose people will bring him up for you and look after him
	well?&quot; Thus, the Arabic idiom and the usage of the Qur'an and
	the context of this verse, 'all point clearly to the fact that the
	Holy Prophet's wives as well as his children are included in his ahl
	al-bait; rather the more correct thing is that the verse is actually
	addressed to the wives and the children become included in the
	household only because of the sense of the word. That is why
	according to lbn 'Abbas and 'Urwah bin Zubair and `Ikrimah, the word
	ahl al-bait in this verse implies the wives of the Holy Prophet. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But if
	somebody says that the word ahl al-bait has been used only for the
	wives and none else can be included in it, it will also be wrong.
	Not only this that the word &quot;household&quot; includes all the
	members of a man's family, but the Holy Prophet has himself
	explained that this includes even himself. According to Ibn Abi
	Hatim, once when Hadrat `A'ishah was asked about Hadrat `Ali, she
	said, Do you ask me about the person who was among the most loved
	ones of the Holy Prophet and whose wife was the Holy Prophet's
	daughter and most beloved to him?&quot; Then she related the event
	when the Holy Prophet had called Hadrat 'Ali and Fatimah and Hasan
	and Husain (may Allah be pleased with them all) and covered them all
	with a sheet of cloth and prayed: &quot;O Allah, these are my
	household, remove uncleanness from them and make them pure.&quot;
	Hadrat 'A'ishah says, &quot;I said: I also am included among your
	household (i.e. I may also be covered under the sheet and prayed
	for). &quot; Thereupon the Holy Prophet replied&quot; You stay out:
	you, . of course, are already included.&quot; A great many Ahadith
	bearing on this subject have been related by traditionalists like
	Muslim, Tirmidhi, Ahmad, Ibn Jarir, Hakim, Baihaqi, etc. on the
	authority of Abu Said Khudri, Hadrat 'A'ishah, Hadrat Anas, Hadrat
	Umm Salamah, Hadrat Wathilah bin Aqsa' and some other Companions,
	which show that the Holy Prophet declared Hadrat 'AIi and Fatimah
	and their two sons as his ahl al-bait. Therefore, the view of those
	who exclude them from the ahl al-bait is not correct. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Similarly
	the view of those people also is not correct, who, on the basis of
	the above-cited Ahadith, regard the wives of the Holy Prophet as
	excluded from his ahl al-bait. In the first place, anything which
	has been clearly stated in the Quran cannot be contradicted on the
	basis of a Hadith. Secondly, these Ahadith also do not have the
	meaning that is put on them. As related in some traditions that the
	Holy Prophet did not cover Hadrat 'A'ishah and Hadrat Umm Salamah
	under the sheet of cloth which he put on the four members of his
	family, dces not mean that he had excluded those ladies from his
	&quot;household.&quot; But it means that the wives were already
	included in ahl al-bait, because the Qur'an, in fact, had addressed
	them as ahl al-bait. The Holy Prophet, however, thought that the
	apparent words of the Qur'an might cause somebody the
	misunderstanding about these members that they were excluded from
	the ahl al-bait. Therefore, he felt the need for clarification in
	their case and not in the case of his wives. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A section
	of the people have not only misconstrued this verse to the extent
	that they have made the word ahl al-bait exclusively applicable to
	Hadrat `AIi and Fatimah and their children to the exclusion of the
	holy wives, but have gone even further and concluded wrongly from
	its words &quot;Allah only intends to remove uncleanliness from you
	and purify you completely&quot;, that Hadrat 'Ali and Fatimah and
	their children are infallible like the Prophets of Allah. They say
	that &quot;uncleanliness&quot; implies error and sin, and, as Allah
	says, these ahl al-bait have been purified of this, whereas the
	words of the verse do not say that uncleanliness has been removed
	from them and they have been purified. But the words are to the
	effect: &quot;Allah intends to remove uncleanliness from you and
	purify you completely. &quot; The context also does not tell that
	the object here is to mention the virtues and excellences of the
	Holy Prophet's household. On the contrary, they have been advised
	here what they should do and what they should not, because Allah
	intends to purify them. In other words, they have been told that if
	they adopted such and such an attitude and way of life, they will be
	blessed with cleanliness, otherwise not. However, if the words
	&quot;Allah intends to remove uncleanliness from yon . . . &quot;
	are taken to mean that Allah has made them infallible, then is no
	reason why all the Muslims who perform their ablutions before
	offering the Prayer are not held as infallible, because about them
	also Allah says: &quot;But Allah wills to purify you and complete
	His blessings upon you.&quot; (Al-Ma'idah: 6)&nbsp;

	word wadhkurna in the original has two meanings: Remember and
	mention. According to the first meaning the verse would mean: &quot;O
	wives of the Prophet, you should never forget that yours is the
	house from where the would is being instructed in Divine Revelations
	and Wisdom; therefore, your responsibility is very great. Let it not
	happen that the people might see specimens of ignorance in this very
	house.&quot; According to the second meaning, it would mean: &quot;O
	wives of the Prophet, you should mention and relate before the
	people whatever you hear and see, for by virtue of your close and
	constant social association and attachment with the Prophet you will
	know and experience many such things which the other people. will
	not be able to know by any other means than you. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Two
	things have been mentioned in this verse: (1) The Revelations of
	Allah; and (2) the wise sayings. The revelations of Allah are the
	verses of Allah's Book, but hikmat (wisdom) is a comprehensive word
	which includes all those wise things which the Holy Prophet taught
	the people. This word may also imply the teachings of the Book of
	Allah, but there is no reason why it should be made exclusively
	applicable to them. It inevitably includes the wisdom that the Holy
	Prophet taught by his pure character and by his sayings besides
	reciting the verses of the Qur'an. Some people, only on the basis
	that the word ma yutla (that which is recited) has been used in the
	verse, make the assertion that the &quot;Revelations of Allah&quot;
	and &quot;Wisdom&quot; imply only the Qur'an, for the word
	&quot;recitation&quot; as a term is specifically used for the
	recitation of the Qur'an. But this reasoning is absolutely wrong.
	The use of the word &quot;recitation&quot; specifically as a term
	for the recitation of the Qur'an or the Book of Allah is the work of
	the people of the later ages. The Qur'an has not used this word as a
	term. In Surah AI-Baqarah: 102, this same word has been used for the
	incantation of the magical formulas which the satans falsely
	attributed to the Prophet Solomon and taught the people. (&quot;They
	followed that which the satans recited attributing it to the kingdom
	of Solomon. &quot;) This shows that the Qur'an uses this word in its
	lexical meaning, and does not specify it for reciting the verses of
	the Book of Allah.&nbsp;

	there is no difference between the man and woman. However, as for
	their life-activity, the two sexes have separate spheres to

	the females in some others. But if they possess these qualities and

	bless them with equal rewards. It will in no way affect their rank
	and reward if one carried out household chores and the other
	performed the duties of caliphate and enforced the Shari'ah

	'Abbas, Qatadah, 'Ikrimah and Muqatil bin Hayyan say that this verse
	was sent down at the time when the Holy Prophet proposed Hadrat
	Zainab for Hadrat Zaid, and Zainab and her relatives did not agree.
	According to Ibn 'Abbas, when the Holy Prophet made the proposal,
	Hadrat Zainab said, &quot;I am better than him in lineage.&quot; Ibn
	Sa'd says that she also said, &quot;I do not approve him for myself.
	I am a Quraishite by birth. &quot; The same sort of disapproval was
	expressed by her brother, 'Abdullah bin Jahsh, because Hadrat Zaid
	was a freed slave of the Holy Prophet and Hadrat Zainab was the
	daughter of his paternal aunt, Umaimah bint 'Abdul Muttalib. They
	did not like the Holy Prophet to propose a girl of a noble
	Quraishite family, who was none other than his own first cousin, for
	his freed slave. At this, this verse was sent down and on hearing it
	Hadrat Zainab and all her relatives yielded to the proposal at once.
	Then the Holy Prophet married them, paid ten diners and 60 dirhams
	from his own pocket as dower on behalf of Zaid, provided the bridal
	dress and sent some articles of food for domestic use.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Though
	this verse was sent down on g special occasion, the injunction given
	in it is the cardinal principle of the constitutional law of Islam,
	and it applies to the entire Islamic system of life. According to it
	no Muslim individual or nation, or institution, or court or
	parliament or state, is entitled to use its own freedom of opinion
	in a matter in which Allah and His Prophet have already given a
	decision. To be a Muslim means to surrender one's freedom of opinion
	and action before Allah and His Messenger. It would be a
	contradiction in terms if a person or a nation claimed to be Muslim
	and then reserved for itself the freedom of choice and action. No
	sensible person can think of combining the two contradictory
	attitudes together. The one who desires to remain a Muslim will
	inevitably have to bow down to the Command of Allah and His Prophet,
	and the one who is not inclined to bow will have to admit that he is
	not a Muslim. If he does not admit he will be regarded as a
	hypocrite both by God and by the people even though he might
	proclaim to be a Muslim at the top of his voice.&nbsp;

	While studying these verses one should bear in mind the fact that
	this Divine discourse was not meant for the instruction of the
	enemies who were engaged. in a willful campaign of vilification and
	slander and falsehood to defame the Holy Prophet intentionally and
	to satisfy their rancor. But its real object was to protect the
	Muslims against the influence of their campaign and to safeguard
	them against doubts and suspicions. Evidently, the Word of Allah
	could not satisfy the unbelievers. It could give peace of mind only
	to those who knew and believed it to be Allah's Word. There was a
	danger that those righteous people also might be confused and
	influenced by the objections that were being raised by their
	enemies. Therefore, on the one hand, Allah removed all possible

<DIV ID="sdfootnote68">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote68sym" HREF="#sdfootnote68anc">68</A>It
	refers to Hadrat Zaid as has been mentioned clearly below. In order
	to understand how Allah had favored him and how the Holy Prophet, it
	is necessary here to relate his story briefly. He was the son of
	Harithah bin Shurahbil, a person of the Kalb tribe, and his mother,
	Su'da bint Tha'labah, was from the Bani Ma'n, a branch of the Tay
	tribe. When he was eight years old, she took him along to her
	parents. There the people of Bani Qain bin Jasr raided their camp,
	plundered their good: and took some men prisoners, Hadrat Zaid
	included. Then they sold Zaid at the fair of 'Ukiiz near Ta'if. His
	buyer was Hakim bin Hizam, a nephew of Hadrat Khadijah. Hakim
	brought him to Makkah and presented him to his paternal aunt. When
	the Holy Prophet married Hadrat Khadijah he found Zaid in her
	service and was so impressed by his good manners and conduct that he
	asked him of her. Thus, this fortunate boy entered the service of
	the best of men, whom Allah, after a few years, was going to appoint
	a Prophet. Hadrat Zaid at that time was 15 years old. Afterwards
	when his father and uncle came to know that their child was at
	Makkah, they came to the Holy Prophet and requested him to return
	him in exchange for ransom. The Holy Prophet said, &quot;I shall
	call the boy and leave it to him whether he would like to go with
	you or stay with me. If he chose to go, I would take no ransom but
	would Iet Trim go with you. However, if he chose to stay back, I am
	not the one who would turn out a person who would like to stay with
	me.&quot; They said, &quot;This is perfectly right and just. Please
	ask the boy.&quot; The Holy Prophet called Zaid and asked him, Do
	you know these two gentlemen?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes sir, this is
	my father and this my uncle.&quot; The Holy Prophet then said,
	&quot;Well, you know them as well as me. You have the choice to go
	with them, or stay with me if you so desire. &quot; He said, &quot;I
	have no wish to leave you and go with anyone else. &quot; His father
	and uncle said, I 'Zaid, will you prefer slavery to freedom, and
	choose to stay with others in preference to your parents and
	family?&quot; He replied, &quot;After what I have seen of this
	person I cannot now prefer anything else of the world to him.&quot;
	Hearing the reply the father and uncle of Zaid were reconciled to
	his remaining with the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet set Zaid free
	immediately and proclaimed before a gathering of the Quraish in the
	Ka'bah, &quot;Bear witness that hence-forth Zaid is my son: he will
	receive inheritance from me and I from him.&quot; Thereafter, he
	began to be called Zaid bin Muhammad by the people. All this
	happened before the Holy Prophet's advent as a Prophet. Then, when
	he was blessed with Prophethood by Allah, there were four persons
	who accepted his claim to it without a moment's hesitation as soon
	as they heard of it from him. They were Hadrat Khadijah, Hadrat
	Zaid, Hadrat 'AIi and Hadrat Abu Bakr. Hadrat Zaid was 30 years old
	then, and had already spent 15 years in the Holy Prophet's service.
	In the fourth year after Hijrah, the Holy Prophet marred him to his
	first cousin Hadrat Zainab, paid her dower on his behalf and
	provided them with necessary articles for setting up the house.

	words were said when the relations between Hadrat Zaid and Hadrat
	Zainab had become very strained, and after making repeated
	complaints Hadrat Zaid had finally told the Holy Prophet that he
	intended to divorce her. Although Hadrat Zainab had accepted to be
	married to him in obedience to Allah and His Messenger's command,
	she could not overcome her feeling that Zaid was a freed slave, who
	had been brought up by her own family, and she in spite of being the
	daughter of a noble Arab family, had been wedded to him. Due to this
	feeling she could never regard Hadrat Zaid as her equal in
	matrimonial lift, and this caused more and more bitterness between
	them. Thus after a little more than a year the marriage ended in
	divorce.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote70">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote70sym" HREF="#sdfootnote70anc">70</A>Some
	people have misconstrued this sentence to mean this: The Holy
	Prophet desired to marry Hadrat Zainab and wanted that Zaid should
	divorce her. But when Zaid came to the Holy Prophet and said that he
	wanted to divorce his wife, the Holy Prophet stopped him from this
	only half-heartedly. At this Allaln said: 'You were keeping hidden
	in your heart that which Allah intended to reveal. The real meaning,
	however, is contrary to this. If this the sentence is read with
	verses 1, 2, 3 and 7 of this Surah, one can clearly see that in the
	very days when bitterness was increasing between Hadrat Zaid and his
	wife, Allah had hinted to His Prophet that when Zaid had divorced
	his wife, he would have to marry the divorced lady. But since the
	Holy Prophet knew what it meant to marry the divorced wife of the
	adopted son in the contemporary Arab society, and that too at a time
	when apart from a handful of the Muslims the entire country had
	become jealous of him, he was hesitant to take any step in that
	direction. That is why when Hadrat Zaid expressed his intention to
	divorce his wife, the Holy Prophet said to him, `Fear Allah and do
	not divorce your wife.&quot; What he meant by this was that Zaid
	should not divorce his wife so that he was saved from facing the
	trial, otherwise in case the divorce was pronounced he would have to
	comply with the command, and thus provoke a severe storm of
	criticism and vilification against himself. But when the Holy
	Prophet deliberately forbade Zaid to divorce his wife so that he
	himself might be saved from what he feared would cause him
	defamation, Allah found this below the high position that He wanted
	His Prophet to enjoy, whereas Allah intended to effect a great
	reform through this marriage of the Prophet. The words 'You were
	fearing the people, whereas Allah has a greater right that you
	should fear Him,&quot; clearly point to the same theme. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The same
	explanation of this verse has been given by Imam Zain-ul-'Abedin
	Hadrat 'AIi bin Husain (may Allah be pleased with him). He says,
	Allah had indicated to His Prophet that Zainab would be included
	among his wives. But when Zaid complained about her to him, the Holy
	Prophet admonished him to fear Allah and keep his wife. At this
	Allah said to His Prophet, 'I had informed you that I would marry
	you to Zainab. But when you were forbidding Zaid to divorce his
	wife, you were hiding that which Allah was going to reveal'.&quot;
	(Ibn Jarir, Ibn Kathir on the authority of Ibn Abi Hatim). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">'Allama
	Alusi also in his Ruh al-Ma ani has given the same meaning of it. He
	says, 'This is an expression of displeasure on abandoning the better
	course, which was that the Holy Prophet should have kept quiet, or
	should have told Zaid to do as he liked. The displeasure amounted to
	this: 'Why did you tell Zaid to keep his wife, whereas I had
	informed you beforehand that Zainab would be included among your
	wives?&quot;&nbsp;

	is, Zaid divorced his wife and her waiting-period came to an end.
	The words &quot;fulfilled his desire of her&quot; by themselves give
	the meaning that Zaid was left with no desire attached to her. And
	this state of affairs does not appear on mere pronouncement of the
	divorce, because even during the waiting period the husband can take
	his wife back if he has any interest in her; and the husband also
	has this desire left with the divorced wife that it should become
	known whether she is pregnant or not. Therefore, the desire of her

	opponents were raising in connection with this marriage of the Holy
	Prophet. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Their
	first objection was that he had married his own daughter-in-law,
	whereas according to his own law the son's wife is forbidden for the
	father. This was answered by saying: &quot;Muhammad is not the
	father of any of your men.&quot; That is, Zaid was not his real son,
	and so it was not unlawful to marry his divorced wife.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Their
	second objection was that even if his adopted son was not his real
	son, it was not necessary that he should have marred his divorced
	wife. This was answered by saying: '' . . . but he is the Messenger
	of Allah.&quot; That is, it was his duty as the Messenger of Allah
	to put an end to all kinds of prejudices about a lawful thing which
	custom and tradition had made unlawful without good reason and
	declare it to be lawful once again. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The point
	was stressed by saying: &quot; ... and (he is) the last of the
	Prophets.&quot; That is, not to speak of a Messenger, no other
	Prophet would be raised after him, who could make up for a possible
	deficiency in the enforcement of a reform in the law and society
	that might have been left un-enforced in his time. Therefore, it had
	become all the more necessary that he should himself root out the
	custom of ignorance. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Again, to
	further emphasize this point, it was said: &quot;Allah has knowledge
	of everything. &quot; that is, Allah knows best why it was
	imperative to get the custom of ignorance rooted out at that
	juncture through the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
	peace) rather than let it remain as it was. He knows that no other
	prophet would be coming after him in the future; therefore, if He
	did not abolish this custom through His Last Prophet, no other
	person after him would be able to abolish it for all the Muslims of
	the world for ever. Even if the later reformers would abolish it, no
	action of any one of them will have the permanent and universal
	authority behind it so that the people of every country and every
	age might -start following it, and none of them would have a

	morality and civilization and social life that God has revealed to
	him, and reject as wrong all the concepts and ways which are
	prevalent and are opposed to them, even if the whole world rejects
	them as wrong and violates them in practice. Similarly, the Prophet
	should proclaim as lawful what is lawful in Allah's Law even if the
	whole world regards it as unlawful, and should proclaim as unlawful
	whatever is unlawful in Allah's Law even if the world regards it as
	lawful and pure.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Practical evidence: That is, the Prophet in his own life should
	practically demonstrate all that he has been commissioned to present
	before the world. His life should be free from every shade of that
	which he calls evil, and his own character should clearly reflect
	that which he calls good; he should be the foremost in carrying out
	what he regards as obligatory, and most cautious in refraining from
	what he calls sinful. He should exert his utmost to enforce the code
	of life which he calls Divine. His own character and conduct should
	bear out how sincere and truthful he is in his invitation; and his
	own self should be such a model of his teaching that anyone who sees
	him should know what kind of a man he wants to produce by the Faith
	to which he invites the world, what kind of a character he wants to
	instill in him and what system of life he wants to be established
	through him in the world. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
	Evidence in the Hereafter That is, when the Court of Allah is
	established in the Hereafter, the Prophet should give evidence to
	prove that he had conveyed to the people the whole message, without
	making any alteration or change in it, that had been entrusted to
	him, and that he had shown no slackness in making the truth manifest
	before them, by word and by deed. On the basis of this evidence it
	will be determined what reward the believers deserve and what
	punishment the disbelievers deserve 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From this
	one can have an idea of how great a responsibility had Allah placed
	upon the Holy Prophet by raising him to the position of a &quot;witness&quot;,
	and how great should be the personality worthy of that high
	position. Evidently, there has been no slackness whatever on the
	part of the Holy Prophet in the matter of giving evidence with
	regard to the Faith, verbally as well as practically. That is why in
	the Hereafter he will be able to testify that he had made the Truth
	plain to the people, and that is how Allah's argument will be
	established against them; otherwise, if, God forbid, there had been
	any slackness on the pan of the Prophet in providing evidence, he
	could neither be a witness against them in the Hereafter nor could
	any case be established against the deniers of the truth. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people have tried to give a different interpretation to the word
	witness&quot;. They say that the Holy Prophet in the Hereafter will
	bear witness to the acts and deeds of the people. From this they
	conclude that the Holy Prophet is watching and witnessing the acts
	of all the people; otherwise he could not bear the witness. But
	according to the Qur'an this interpretation is absolutely wrong. The
	Qur'an tells us that Allah has arranged a different system for
	recording the acts of the people. For this purpose His angels are
	preparing the conduct-book of every person. (See in this connection
	Surah Qaf: 17-18, and Al-Kahf: 49). After this He will make the
	people's own limbs also to bear witness against them. (Ya Sin: 65,
	Ha Mim As-Sajdah: 20-21). As for the Prophets, they are not to
	testify to the acts of the people, but to give evidence to prove
	that they had conveyed the Truth to the people. The Qur'an clearly
	says: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;On
	the Day when Allah will assemble all the Messengers, He will ask:
	'What was the response you received?' They will answer, `We have no
	knowledge: You alone have the full knowledge of all that is
	hidden'.&quot; (AI-Ma`idah: 109) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	same connection, the Quran says about the Prophet Jesus that when he
	will be questioned about the deviation of the Christians, he will
	say: &quot;I was a witness to their conduct as long as I remained
	among them, but after You recalled me. You watched over them.&quot;
	(AI-Ma'idah: 117) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These
	verses clearly show that the Prophets will not be witnesses in
	regard to the acts of the people. As to what they will bear witness
	to the Qur'an gives an equally clear answer: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;O
	Muslims, We have made you a community of the 'Golden Mean' so that
	you may be witnesses in regard to mankind and the Messenger may be a
	witness in regard to you.&quot; (AI-Baqarah: 143) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;(O
	Muhammad, warn them of) the Day when We shall call a witness from
	among every community to testify against it. And We shall call you
	to testify against these people.&quot; (An-Nahl: 89) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	shows that on the Day of Resurrection the Holy Prophet's evident in
	its nature will not be any different from the evidence for bearing
	which the Holy Prophet's community and the witnesses in regard to
	every other community will be summoned. Evidently, if it be an
	evidence in regard to the acts, then the omnipresence of all of them
	also becomes necessary. And if these witnesses will be called to
	give evidence to confirm that the Creator's message had reached His
	creation, inevitably the Holy Prophet also will be called upon to
	give a similar evidence. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The same
	is supported by the Hadith which Bukhari. Muslim, Tirmidhi. Ibn
	Majah, lmam Ahmad and others have related on the authority of
	'Abdullah bin 'Mas'ud, 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas, Abu ad-Darda', Anas bin
	Malik and many other Companions (may Allah be pleased with them
	all), whose common theme is this: 'The Holy Prophet on the Day of
	Resurrection will sec some of his Companions bing brought, but
	instead of caning to him they will either be going or being pushed
	to the other side. Thereupon the Holy Prophet will say: 'O Allah,
	they are my Companions!' Allah will say: 'You do not know what
	misdeeds they committed after you'.&quot; This theme has been
	reported by numerous Companions and with so many chains of
	authorities that there remains no doubt about its authenticity. This
	proves that the Holy Prophet is not at all a witness to each
	individual of his community acid to each of his acts. As for the
	hadith which says that the acts of the people of his Ummah are
	presented before him, it does not in any way contradict this,
	because its purport is that Allah keeps him informed of the affairs
	of his Ummah, which does not mean that the Holy Prophet is actually
	witnessing the acts of every person.&nbsp;

	to call the people towards Allah by the leave of Allah. His call is

	sentence is explicit that the word nikah here has been used for the
	contract of marriage only. The lexicographers have greatly disputed
	over the real meaning of the Arabic word nikah. One section of them
	says that as a word it is common both for intercourse and for the
	contract of marriage. The second section says that in its meaning it
	is common for both. The third section opines that its real meaning
	is the contract of marriage and for intercourse it is used only
	figuratively. And the fourth section expresses the opinion that its
	real meaning is intercourse and for the contract of marriage it is
	used only figuratively. Each section has cited Arabic poetry in
	support of its view. But Raghib Isfahani has emphatically asserted
	this: &quot;The real meaning of the word nikah is contract of
	marriage; it has been used for intercourse metaphorically. It is
	impossible that its real meaning be intercourse and may have been
	used for the contract of marriage only metaphorically.&quot; The
	argument he gives is that all the words that have been actually
	coined for intercourse in Arabic, or in other languages of the
	world, arc obscene and vulgar. No gentleman would like to utter them
	in a civilized gathering. Therefore, it is not possible that a
	society should use the word which has actually been coined for this
	act for marriage as a metaphor. For conveying this meaning only
	chaste words have been used in every language of the world and not
	obscene words.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As far as

<DIV ID="sdfootnote86">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote86sym" HREF="#sdfootnote86anc">86</A>This
	is a unique verse which was sent down probably in the same period
	respecting some case of divorce, and so inserted in this context.
	This shows that it was sent down after the preceding and before the
	following discourse. Below is given a summary of the legal
	injunctions that have been derived from this verse:' 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Although the word &quot;believing women&quot; has been used, which
	apparently may give the impression that the law enunciated in this
	verse is not applicable to the women of the people of the Book, yet
	all scholars are agreed that this very injunction is applicable to
	them also. That is, in case a Muslim has married such a woman, all
	the injunctions relating to her divorce, dower, waiting-period
	('iddat) and provision at divorce are the same as of marriage with
	'a believing woman. The scholars arc also agreed that Allah's
	mentioning the believing women here in particular is actually meant
	to tell the Muslims that only the believing women are suitable for
	them. That is, although it is permissible for them to marry Jewish
	and Christian women, it is not proper and commendable. In other
	words, the Qur'an seems to impress that Allah expects that the
	believers would marry only the believing women. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	word mas (to touch) here has been used for intercourse by
	implication. Thus, the verse apparently implies that if the husband
	has not had intercourse with the woman, even though he has had
	seclusion with her and has even touched her with the hand, she will
	riot have to observe the waiting-term ( iddat) in case of divorce.
	But the jurists, for the sake of precaution, have decreed that if
	they have had seclusion proper (i.e. seclusion during which
	intercourse could be possible), waiting-period will have to be
	observed if divorce is pronounced after it, and the waiting-period
	would be annulled only in case divorce was pronounced before they
	have had the seclusion. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	annulment of the waiting-period in case of divorce before the event
	of seclusion means that in this case the man forfeits his right to
	take the woman back as his wife, and the woman becomes entitled to
	marry anyone she likes immediately after the divorce. But it should
	be borne in mind that this applies only to the divorce which is
	pronounced' before the event of the seclusion. If a woman's husband
	dies before having had seclusion, the waiting-period that has to be
	observed after death will not be annulled, but she will have to pass
	the same waiting-period of four months and ten days as is obligatory
	for a married woman in normal conditions. ( 'Iddat is the
	waiting-period before the expiry of which a divorced woman or a
	widow is forbidden to remarry). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	words &quot;they do not have to fulfill a waiting-period for you&quot;,
	show that the waiting-period is a right of the man on the woman. But
	it does not mean that this is only the man's right. It, in fact,
	includes two other rights as well: the right of the children, and
	the right of Allah or of the Law. The man's right is on the ground
	that he has the right to take the woman back as his wife during the
	period, and also on the ground that the proof of the parentage of
	his children, which depends on the woman's being pregnant or
	otherwise, becomes established in the waiting-period. The reason for
	including the right of the children is that the proof of a child's
	parentage is necessary for the establishment of his legal rights and
	his moral status also depends on this that his parentage should not
	be doubtful. The reason for including the right of Allah (or the
	right of the Law) is that even if the people and their children
	become heedless of their rights, the Divine Law requires that their
	rights should be protected. That is why even if a man gives a
	warrant to a woman that after his death or after obtaining divorce
	from him, there will be no waiting-period binding on her from him,
	the Divine Law will in no case annul it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5)
	&quot;Provide them with something and send them away with kindness&quot;;
	The intention of this injunction would be fulfilled by acting in
	either of the two ways: If the dower had been fixed at the time of
	marriage, and then divorce pronounced before the event of seclusion
	proper, payment of half of the dower will be obligatory, as enjoined
	in AI-Baqarah: 237. To give more than what is obligatory is not
	binding but certainly commendable. For instance, it is commendable
	that besides paying half of the dower the man should let the woman
	retain the bridal garments, or any other articles that he had sent
	her for the occasion of marriage. But if no dower had been fixed at
	the time of marriage, it is obligatory to pay her something before
	sending her away, and this &quot;something&quot; should be according
	to the status and financial means of the man, as has been enjoined
	in Al Baqarah: 236. One section of the scholars hold that something
	in any case has to be paid in case of divorce as an obligation
	whether dower has been fixed or not. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6)
	&quot;sending off gracefully&quot; does not only mean that the woman
	should be provided with something on divorce but this also that
	separation should be adopted in a gentlemanly way, without any kind
	of vilification. If a man does not happen to like a woman, or there
	has been some other cause of complaint due to which he does not want
	to keep the woman, he should divorce her like a gentleman and send
	her away. He should not start mentioning her faults and relating his
	complaints against her before the people so as to also prejudice
	them against her. This instruction of the Qur'an clearly shows that
	annexing the enforcement of divorce to the permission of a local
	council or court is wholly against the wisdom and spirit of the
	Divine Law, for in that case there remains no chance of `sending her
	away gracefully&quot;, but defamation, revilement and vilification
	do inevitably result even if the man does not so will. Moreover, the
	words of the verse also do not admit that the power of the man to
	divorce should be bound up with the permission of a local council or
	court. The verse is clearly giving the married man the power of
	divorce and placing on him alone the responsibility that if he wants
	to release the woman before touching her he must pay her half the
	dower as an obligation, or something else according to his means.
	From this the object of the verse clearly seems to be that in order
	to prevent divorce from being taken lightly the man should be placed
	under the burden of a financial responsibility so that he himself
	uses his power of divorce with sense, and there is no chance of an
	external interference in the internal affairs of the two families. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) Ibn
	'Abbas, Said bin al-Musayyib, Hasan Basri, 'AIi bin al-Husain (Zain
	al-'Abidin), Imam Shafe'i and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal have deduced
	from the words, 'when you marry...and then divorce ...&quot; that
	divorce takes effect only when marriage has been contracted. Divorce
	before the contract of marriage ' is without effect. Therefore if a
	person says, &quot;If I marry such and such a woman, or a woman of
	such and such a tribe or nation, or any other woman, she is
	divorced,&quot; it will be an absurd and meaningless thing; no
	divorce can take effect from this. The following Ahadith are
	presented in support of this view: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	son of Adam is not entitled to use his power of divorce in respect
	of that which he does not possess.&quot; (Ahmad, Abu Da'ud,
	Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah). And: &quot;There is no divorce before
	marriage.&quot; (Ibn Majah). But a great number of the jurists hold
	that this verse and these Ahadith apply in the case when a man says
	to a woman, who is not his wife, &quot;You have divorce on you,&quot;
	or &quot;I divorce you.&quot; Saying such a thing is no doubt
	absurd, and is of no legal consequence, but if he says, &quot;If I
	marry you, you are divorced,&quot; this is not divorcing before the
	marriage, but the person is in fact declaring his intent that when
	the woman is married to him, she will stand divorced. Such a
	declaration cannot be absurd and without effect, but, as a matter of
	fact, whenever the woman is married to him, divorce will fall on
	her. The jurists who hold the view have further differed as to rite
	extent this kind of divorce will have effect.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Imam Abu
	Hanifah, Imam Muhammad and Imam Zufar hold that divorce will take

	divorced.&quot; Abu Bakr al-Jassas has cited the same opinion also

	The words &quot;who emigrated with you&quot;do not mean that they
	accompanied the Holy Prophet in his migration journey but this that
	they also had migrated in the way of Allah for the sake of Islam.
	The Holy Prophet was given the choice to marry any one of them he
	liked. Accordingly, in A.H. 7 he married Hadrat Umm Habibah.
	(Incidentally, in this verse it has been elucidated that the
	daughters of one's paternal and maternal uncles and aunts are lawful
	for a Muslim. In this regard the Islamic Law is different both from
	the Christian Law and from the Jewish Law. Among the Christians one
	cannot marry a woman whose line of descent joins one's own anywhere
	in the last seven generations, and among the Jews it is permissible
	even to marry one's real niece, i.e. daughter of one's brother or

	did not think he should have conjugal relations with her without
	paying her the dower. Therefore, he paid her the dower even though
	she did not demand or desire it. Some commentators say that the Holy
	Prophet did not have any wife who had offend herself to him; but

	this sentence is taken to be related with the preceding sentence, it

	passage, it will imply that the concession to marry more than four
	wives is only reserved for the Holy Prophet, not for the other
	Muslims. This verse also shows that certain commandments are
	specifically meant for the Holy Prophet to follow and are not
	applicable to the other Muslims. A study of the Qur'an and Sunnah
	reveals several such commandments. For example, the Tahajjud prayer
	was obligatory for the Holy Prophet but is voluntary for the Ummah.
	It is unlawful for him and his family to receive charities though it
	is not so for others. The inheritance left by him cannot be divided;
	as for the inheritance left by others relevant commandments have
	been given in Surah An-Nisa'. Keeping of more than four wives was
	made lawful for him though he was not enjoined to do equal treatment
	with them. He was permitted to marry a woman who gave herself to him
	without any dower, and after his death his wives wen forbidden for
	the Ummah. None of these privileges could be enjoyed by any other
	Muslim. Another special thing that the commentators have mentioned
	in this regard is that it was forbidden for the Holy Prophet to
	marry a woman from among the people of the Book though it is lawful
	for the Muslims to do so.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote90sym" HREF="#sdfootnote90anc">90</A>This
	is the reason why Allah made the Holy Prophet an exception to the
	general rule. &quot;So that there may be no restraint on you&quot;
	does not mean that he was, God forbid, a very lustful person, and
	therefore, he was permitted to marry several wives so that he might
	not feel any hindrance due to the restriction to four wives. This
	meaning will be understood only by the person who, blinded by
	prejudice, forgets that the Holy Prophet at the age of 25 married a
	lady who was 40 years old, and lived a happy, contented married life
	with her for full 25 years. Then, when she died, he marred another
	old lady Hadrat Saudah, who remained his only wife for the next four
	years. Now, no sensible and honest person can imagine that when he
	became over fifty-three he was suddenly filled with lust and needed
	to have more and more wives. In fact, in order to understand the
	meaning of &quot;no restraint&quot;, one should, on the one hand,
	keep in view the great task whose responsibility Allah had placed on
	the Holy Prophet, and on the other, understand the conditions and
	circumstances under which he had been appointed to accomplish the
	great task. Anyone who understands these two things with an unbiased
	mind, will certainly realize why it was necessary to grant him
	freedom in respect of the wives and what 'hindrance&quot; was there
	for him in the restriction to tour wives.

	was not uncivilized only from the Islamic point of view but from a
	general viewpoint as well, into a highly civilized, refined and
	virtuous nation. For this purpose it was not enough only to train
	men but the training of the women also was equally necessary.
	However, the principles of social life and civilization which he had
	been appointed to teach forbade free mixing of the sexes together,
	and it was not possible for him to impart direct training to the
	womenfolk himself without violating this rule. Therefore, for
	imparting education to the women the only alternative left for him
	was that he should marry several women of different ages and mental
	capabilities and should prepare them by education and training to
	become his helpers, and then employ them to give religious
	instructions to the young, middle-aged and old women of the city and
	desert and teach them the new principles of morality and
	civilization. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Moreover,
	the Holy Prophet had also been appointed to abolish the system of
	life of the pre-Islamic days of ignorance and replace it with the
	Islamic system of life practically. For the accomplishment of this
	task a conflict was inevitable with those who upheld the system of
	ignorance, and this conflict was being encountered in a country
	where the tribal system of life was prevalent with all its peculiar
	customs and traditions. Under these conditions, besides other
	devices, it was also necessary that the Holy Prophet should marry in
	different families and clans in order to cement many ties of
	friendship and put an end to enmities. Thus, the selection of the
	ladies whom he marred was to some extent determined by this object
	besides their personal qualities. By taking Hadrat 'A'ishah and
	Hadrat Hafsah to wife he further strengthened and deepened the
	relations with Hadrat Abu Bakr and Hadrat 'Umar. Hadrat Umm Salamah
	was the daughter of the family to which Abu Jahl and Khalid bin
	Walid belonged, and Umm Habibah was the daughter of Abu Sufyan.
	These marriages neutralized the enmity of these families to a large
	extent; so much so that after Umm Habibah's marriage Abu Sufyan
	never confronted the Holy Prophet on the battlefield. Hadrat
	Safiyyah, Hadrat Juwairiah and Raihanah belonged to Jewish families.
	When the Holy Prophet married them, after setting them free, the
	hostile Jewish activities against him subsided. For according to the
	Arab traditions when the daughter of a clan or tribe was married to
	a person, he was regarded as the son-in-law of not only the girl's
	family but of the entire tribe, and it was disgraceful to fight the
	son-in-law.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Practical
	reformation of the society and abolition of its customs of ignorance
	was also included among the duties of his office. Therefore, he had
	to undertake one marriage for this purpose also, as has been related
	in detail in this surah Ahzab itself. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">For these
	reasons it was essential that there should be no restriction for the
	Prophet in respect of marriage so that in view of the requirements
	of the great mission entrusted to him he could marry as many women
	as he wanted. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This also
	brings out the error of the view of those people who think that
	polygamy is permissible only under special personal requirements and
	apart from these there can be no other object for which it may be
	permissible. Evidently, the reason for the Holy Prophet to marry
	more wives than one was not that the wife was sick, or barren, or
	that he had no male child. or that there was the question of the
	bringing up of some orphans. Without these restrictions he married
	all his wives either in view of the educational requirements, or for
	the reformation of society, or for political and social objectives.
	The question is, when Allah Himself has not kept polygamy restricted
	to a few particular needs, which arc being mentioned these days and
	the Messenger of Allah took several wives for many purposes other
	than these, how is another person entitled to propose some
	restrictions in the law and then claim that he is imposing these in
	accordance with the Shari'ah? As a matter of fact, the root cause
	for the imposition of these restrictions is the Western concept that
	polygamy is an evil in itself. That very concept has given rise to
	the idea that this unlawful thing can become lawful only in case of
	extreme circumstances. Now, however hard one may try to label this
	imported concept with Islam artificially. it is entirely alien to
	the Qur'an and ,Sunnah and the whole Muslim literature.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote91sym" HREF="#sdfootnote91anc">91</A>This
	verse was meant to relieve the Holy Prophet of the domestic worries
	and anxieties so that he could carry out his duties with full peace
	of mind. When Allah clearly gave hire the power and the authority to
	treat any of his wives as he liked, there remained no chance that
	those believing ladies would trouble him in any way, or would create
	complications for him by their mutual rivalries and domestic
	squabbles. But in spite of having this authority from Allah the Holy
	Prophet meted out full justice to his wives. He did not prefer one
	to the other and would visit each of them regularly by turns. Only
	Abu Razin from among the traditionalists has said that the Holy
	Prophet visited only four of his wives (Hadrat 'A'ishah, Hadrat
	Hafsah, Hadrat Zainab and Hadrat Umm Salamah) by turns and no turn
	had been fixed for the other wives. But all other traditionalists
	and commentators contradict this and prove by authentic traditions
	that even after having this authority the Holy Prophet visited all
	his wives in turn and treated there alike. Bukhari, Muslim, Nasa'i,
	Abu Da'ud and others have reported on the authority of Hadrat
	'A'ishah that even after the revelation of this verse the Holy
	Prophet's practice was that whenever he wanted to visit any of us,
	his wives, on the turn of another wife, he would first ask her
	permission for it. Abu Bakr al-Jassas relates from 'Urwah bin Zubair
	that Hadrat 'A'ishah told him, &quot;As to our rants the Holy
	Prophet never preferred any of us to the other, although it seldom
	happened that he did not visit all his wives on the same day, but he
	never touched a wife unless it was her day by turn.&quot; And this
	also is a tradition from Hadrat 'A'ishah that during his last
	illness when it became difficult for him to move about he asked for
	his other wives' permission to stay with her, and only on their
	approval he passed his last days in her apartment. Ibn Abi Hatim has
	cited this from Imam Zuhri that the Holy Prophet is not known to
	have deprived any of his wives of her turn. To this Hadrat Saudah
	only was an exception, who on account of her advanced age had
	willingly surrendered her turn in favor of Hadrat 'A'ishah 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here,
	nobody should entertain the doubt that Allah had, God forbid, shown
	an undue privilege to His Prophet and deprived his wives of their
	rights. As a matter of fact, the great objectives for the sake of
	which the Holy Prophet had been made an exception to the general
	rule in respect of the number of wives, also demanded that he should
	be afforded full peace in domestic life and anything that could
	cause him distraction and embarrassment should be eradicated. It was
	a unique honor for the holy wives that they were privileged to be
	the life-partners of the greatest of all men like the Holy Prophet,
	and by virtue of this they got the opportunity to become his
	Companions and helpers in the great task of reform and invitation
	that was to become the means of true success for mankind till the
	end of time. Just as the Holy Prophet was offering every kind of
	sacrifice for the sake of this objective and the Companions also
	were following his example according to their capabilities, so it
	was the duty of his wives also to display selflessness in every way.
	Therefore, all the wives accepted Allah's decision with regard to
	themselves happily and willingly. &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote94sym" HREF="#sdfootnote94anc">94</A>This
	verse explains why one is permitted to have conjugal relations with
	one's slave-girls besides the wedded wives, and there is no
	restriction on their number. The same thing has also been stated in
	Surah An-Nisa': 3, AI-Mu'minun: b, and AI-Ma'arij: 30. In all these
	verses the slave-girls have been mentioned as a separate class from
	the wedded wives, and conjugal relations with them have been
	permitted. Moreover, verse 3 of Surah An-Nisa' lays down the number
	of the wives as four, but neither has Allah fixed the number of the
	slave-girls, in that verse nor made any allusion to their number in
	the other relevant verses. Here, of course, the Holy Prophet is
	being addressed and told: &quot;It is no more lawful for you to take
	other women in marriage, or divorce any of the present wives and
	take another wife in her stead; slave-girls, however, are lawful.&quot;
	This shows that no restriction has been imposed in respect of the
	slave girls. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This,
	however, does not mean that the Divine Law has provided the rich an
	opportunity to purchase as many slave-girls as they like for their
	carnal indulgence. This is in fact how the self-seeking people have
	exploited and abused the Law. The Law had been made for the
	convenience of the people; it had not been made to be abused. One
	could, for instance, similarly abuse the Law concerning marriage.
	The Shari'ah permits a man to marry up to four wives and also gives
	him the right to divorce his wife and take another one. This law had
	been made in view of man's requirements and needs. Now, if a person,
	merely for the sake of sensual enjoyment, were to adopt the practice
	of keeping four wives for a time and then divorcing them to be
	replaced by another company of them, it would be abusing the
	provisions of the law, for which the person himself would be
	responsible and not the Shari`ah. Likewise the Shari'ah has allowed
	that the women who are captured in war and whose people do not
	exchange them for Muslim prisoners of war nor ransom them, may be
	kept as slave-girls, and gave the persons to whom they are assigned
	by the government the right to have conjugal relations with them so
	that they do not become a moral hazard for the society. Then, as it
	was not possible to determine the number of the prisoners of war,
	legally also it could nor be determined how many slave girls a
	person could keep at a time. The sale of the slaves and slave-girls
	was also allowed for the reason that if a slave or a slave-girl
	could not pull on well with a master, he or she could be transferred
	to another person so that the same person's permanent ownership did
	not become a cause of unending torture for both the master and the
	captive. The Shari`ah made all these laws keeping in view human
	conditions and requirements for the convenience of men. If these
	have been made a means of sexual enjoyment and luxury by the rich,
	it is they who are to blame for this and not the Shari'ah .&nbsp;

	An-Nur: 27 about a year later. In the ancient times the Arabs would
	enter one another's house unceremoniously. If a person had to see
	another person he did not drink it was necessary to call at the door
	or take permission for entry, but would enter the house and ask the
	womenfolk and children whether the master was at home or not, This
	custom of ignorance was the cause of many evils and would often give
	rise to some serious evils. Therefore, in the beginning a rule was
	made in respect of the houses of the Holy Prophet that no person,
	whether a close friend or a distant relative, could enter them
	without permission. Then in Surah An-Nur a general command was given

	often cause the master of the house great embarrassment. He could
	neither be so discourteous as to tell the visitors to leave because
	it was his meals time, nor could feed so many unexpected guests
	together. For it is not always possible for a person to arrange
	meals immediately for as many visitors as happened to call on him at
	a time. Allah disapproved of this practice and commanded that the
	visitors should go for meals to a house only when invited. This
	Command did not in particular apply to the Holy Prophet's house only
	but the rules were in the beginning enforced in that model household
	so that they become general rules of etiquette in the houses of the

	after they had finished eating, would sit down to endless gossip and
	discussions much to the inconvenience of the people of the house.
	They would often embarrass the Holy Prophet also by this practice,
	but he would forbear and forget. At last on the day of the marriage
	feast of Hadrat Zainab the embarrassment thus caused crossed all
	limits. According to the Holy Prophet's special attendant, Hadrat
	Anas bin Malik, the feast was held at night. Most of the people left
	after taking food but a couple or two of them got engaged jn gossip.
	Disconcerted the Holy Prophet rose and went round to his wives. When

	Bukhari has related on the authority of Hadrat Anas that before the

	several times to the Holy Prophet to the effect: &quot;O Messenger
	of Allah, all sorts of the people, good and bad, come to visit you.
	Would that you commanded your wives to observe hijab. According to
	another tradition, once Hadrat 'Umar said to the holy wives, &quot;If
	what I say concerning you is accepted, my eyes should never see you.
	&quot; But since the Holy Prophet was not independent in making law,
	he awaited Divine Revelation. At last, this Command came down that
	except for the mahram males (as being stated in v. SS below) no
	other man should enter the Holy Prophet's houses, and whoever had to
	ask some thing from the ladies, should ask for it from behind a
	curtain. After this Command curtains were hung at the doors of the
	apartments of the wives, and since the Holy Prophet's house was a
	model for the Muslims to follow, they too hung curtains at their
	doors. The last sentence of the verse itself points out that whoever
	desire that the hearts of the men and women should remain pure,
	should adopt this way.

	because `this is a better way for the purity of your as well as
	their hearts,&quot; could not possibly permit that the men and women
	should freely meet in mixed gatherings, educational and democratic
	institutions and offices, because it did not affect the purity of

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	verse, Muslims have been commanded two things: (1) Sallu alaihi; and
	(2) sallimu taslima. The word Salat when used with the associating
	panicle 'ala gives three meanings: (1) To be inclined to some body,
	to attend to him with love, and to bend over him; (2) to praise
	somebody; and (3) to pray for somebody. Obviously, when the word is
	used in regard to Allah, it cannot be in the third meaning, for it
	is absolutely inconceivable that Allah should pray to someone else;
	it can only be used in the first two meanings. But when this word is
	used for the servants, whether angels or men, it will be in all the
	three meanings. It will contain the sense of love as well as praise
	and prayer for mercy. Therefore, the meaning of giving the Command
	of sallu'alaihi to the believers for the Holy Prophet is: 'Be
	attached to him, praise and adore him and pray for him.&quot;

	salam also ' as two meanings: (1) To be secure from every kind of
	affliction and fault and defect; and (2) to be at peace and refrain
	from opposing the other person. Therefore, one meaning of sallimu
	taslima in regard to the Holy Prophet is: &quot;You should pray for
	his well-being and security,&quot; and another meaning is:
	&quot;Cooperate with him with all your heart and mind; refrain from

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">All these
	daruds agree in meaning despite the difference in wording. A few
	points concerning them should be understood clearly: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, in
	all these the Holy Prophet tells the Muslims that the best way of
	sending darud and Salat on him is that they should pray to Allah,
	saying, &quot;O God: send darud on Muhanunad. &quot; Ignorant people
	who do not possess full understanding of the meaning intermediately
	raise the objection: 'How strange that Allah commands us to send
	darud on His Prophet, but we, in return, implore Allah that He
	should send it.&quot; The fact, however, is that the Holy Prophet
	has instructed the people, as if to say, 'You cannot do full justice
	to sending of darud and Salat on me even if you want to. Therefore,
	pray only to Allah to bless me with Salat. &quot; Evidently, the
	Muslims cannot raise the ranks of the Holy Prophet, Allah only can
	raise them; the Muslims cannot repay the Holy Prophet for his favors
	and kindness, Allah only can adequately reward him for this; the
	Muslims cannot attain any success in exalting the Holy Prophet's
	name and promoting the cause of religion unless Allah favors them
	with His help and succor. So much so that the Holy Prophet's love
	can be impressed in our hearts only by Allah's help; otherwise Satan
	can turn us away from him by every kind of evil suggestion sand
	suspicions. May Allah protect us from this! Therefore, there is no
	other way of doing full justice to sending of darud and salat on the
	Holy Prophet than that we should supplicate Allah to send salat on
	him. The person who says: Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad-in, in fact,
	admits his helplessness before Allah, and says: &quot;O God: it is
	not in my power to send salat on Your Prophet as it should be sent.
	I. therefore, implore You to send it on my behalf and take from me
	whatever service You will in this regard.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	the Holy Prophet did not want to have this prayer reserved for only
	himself bat included his followers and his wives and offspring also.
	The meaning of the wives and offspring is obvious. As for the word
	al it does not merely denote the people of the Holy Prophet's
	household, but it applies to all those people who follow him and
	adopt his way. Lexically, there is a difference between the words al
	and ahl. By the al of a person are understood all those people who
	are his companions, helpers and followers, whether they are related
	to him or not, and his ahl are those who are related to him, whether
	or not they are his companions and followers. The Qur'an has used
	the word al Fir aun at fourteen places but nowhere has it been used
	to mean the people of Pharaoh's household only; everywhere it
	implies all those who sided with him in the conflict against the
	Prophet Moses. (For example, see Al-Baqarah: 49-50, AI-i-'Imran: 11,
	AI-A'raf; 130, Al-Mu'min: 46). Thus, from al-Muhammad is excluded
	every such person who is not on the way of Muhammad (upon whom be
	Allah's peace and blessings), whether he be a member of his
	household, and in it is included every such person, who is following
	in his footsteps, whether he is not even distantly related to him by
	blood. However, those members of the Prophet's household who arc
	related to him by blood and are also his followers are most worthy
	to be regarded as al-Muhammad. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly,
	the same thing found in all the daruds taught by the Holy Prophet is
	that he may be blessed with the same kindness with which Abraham and
	the followers of Abraham have been blessed. The people have found it
	difficult to understand this. The scholars have given different
	interpretations of it but none of them is appealing. In my opinion
	the correct interpretation is this (though the real knowledge is
	with Allah): Allah blessed the Prophet Abraham in particular with
	something with which He has blessed no one else in the world, and it
	is this: AlI those human beings who regard the Prophethood and the
	Revelation and the Book as the source of guidance are agreed on the
	leadership of the Prophet Abraham, whether they are Muslims or
	Christians or Jews. Therefore, what the Holy Prophet means to say is
	this: &quot;O Allah, just as You have made the Prophet Abraham the
	refuge of the followers of all the Prophets, so You make me also the
	refuge, so that no one who is a believer in Prophethood, may remain
	deprived of the grace of believing in my Prophethood.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">That it
	is an Islamic practice to send darud on the Holy Prophet, that it is
	commendable to pronounce it when the Holy Prophet's name is
	mentioned, that it is a Sunnah of the Prophet to recite it in the
	Prayer in particular, is agreed upon by all the scholars. There is
	also a consensus that it is obligatory to pronounce the darud on the
	Holy Prophet at least once in a lifetime, because Allah has clearly
	commanded it, but apart from this there are differences among the
	scholars regarding it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Imam
	Shafe' i holds the view that it is obligatory to recite salat on the
	Prophet during tashahhud in the final sitting of the Prayer, for
	without it the Prayer would be void. Hadrat Ibn Mas'ud, Abu-Mas'ud
	Ansari, Ibn 'Umar and Jabir bin 'Abdullah from among the Companions,
	Sha'bi, Imam Muhammad bin Baqir, Muhammad bin Ka'b al-Qurzi and
	Muqatil bin Hayyan from among the immediate followers of the
	Companions, and Ishaq bin Rahwayah from among the jurists also held
	the same opinion, and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal also had adopted the
	same in the end. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Imam Abu
	Hanifah, Imam Malik and the majority of the scholars hold that the
	pronouncing of the Salat is obligatory only once in a life time. It
	is just like the Kalimah: whoever affirmed the divinity of Allah and
	the Prophethood of the Messenger of Allah once in a lifetime carried
	out his duty. Likewise, the one who pronounced the darud and salat
	once in his lifetime would be deemed to have done his duty of
	pronouncing the darud on the Holy Prophet. After it, it is neither
	obligatory ( fend) to recite the Kalimah nor the darud.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	group holds that it is absolutely wajib to recite it in the Prayer
	but not necessarily in the tashahhud. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Still
	another group holds the view that it is wajib to pronounce the
	darrid in every supplication. Some others say that it is wajib to
	pronounce it whenever the Holy Prophet's name is mentioned, and
	according to another group recitation of the darrid is wajib only
	once in an assembly or sitting no matter how often the name of the
	Holy Prophet is mentioned during it.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These
	differences only pertain to the darud's being obligatory in status
	or otherwise. As for its merit and excellence, its being conducive
	to high spiritual rewards and its being a great righteous act, there
	is complete unanimity among the Ummah. No one who is a believer in
	any degree can have any different opinion about it. The darud is the
	natural supplication of the heart of every Muslim, who realizes that
	the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon Whom be Allah's peace) is the
	Ummah's greatest benefactor after Allah. The greater one's
	appreciation of Islam and the Faith, the greater will one be
	appreciative of the favors of the Holy Prophet himself; and the
	greater one's appreciation of the favors of the Holy Prophet, the
	more often will he pronounce the darud and salat on him. Thus, in
	fact, the frequency with which a person pronounces the darud is the
	measure which shows the depth of his relationship with the Holy
	Prophet's Religion and the extent of his appreciation of the
	blessing of the Faith. On this very basis the Holy Prophet has said:
	&quot;The angels send darud on him who sends darud on me, as long as
	he does so.&quot; (Ahmad, Ibn Majah). &quot;He who sends darud on me
	once, Allah sends darud on him ten times over.&quot; (Muslim) &quot;The
	one who sends darud on me most often will deserve to remain close to
	me on the Day of Resurrection&quot; (Tirmidhi). Niggardly is the
	person who does not send darud on me when I am mentioned before
	him.&quot; (Tirmidhi) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As to
	whether it is permissible to use the words Allahumma salli ala so
	and so, or sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, or similar other words for
	others than the Holy Prophet, it is disputed. One group of the
	scholars of whom Qadi `Iyad is most prominent holds it as absolutely
	permissible. Their argument is this: Allah Himself has used the word
	salat in respect of those who were not prophets at several places in
	the Qur'an, e.g. in AI-Baqarah; 157, At-Taubah: 103, Al-Ahzab:43.
	Similarly, the Holy Prophet also prayed for those who were not'
	prophets using the word sale) on several occasions. For example, he
	prayed for a Companion, thus: Allahumma salli 'ala al Abi Aufa; on
	the request of Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah's wife, he said:
	Sallallahu alaihi wa 'ala zaujiki. Then concerning those who came
	with the Zakat money, he would say: Allahumma salli 'alaihim.
	Praying for Hadrat Sa'd bin 'Ubadah he said: Allahumma aj'al
	salataka wa rahmataka ala al-i Sa'd bin 'Ubadah. And about the soul
	of the believer the Holy Prophet gave the news that the angels
	prayed for him, thus: Sallallahu 'alaika wa ala jasadika. However,
	the majority of the Muslim scholars opine that it was correct for
	Allah and His Messenger but not so for the Ummah. They say that it
	has become a convention with the Muslims to use salat-o-salam
	exclusively for the Prophets. Therefore, it should not be used for
	those who are not prophets. On this very basis Hadrat 'Umar bin
	'Abdul 'Aziz once wrote to one of his governors, saying: &quot;I
	hear that some preachers have started using the word salat in
	respect of their patrons and supporters in the manner of salat
	'alas-Nabi. As soon as you receive this letter, stop them from this
	practice and command them to use Salat exclusively for the Prophets
	and remain content with the prayer for the other Muslims.&quot; (Ruh
	al-Ma'eni). Most scholars also hold that using the words sallallahu
	alaihi wa sallam for any other Prophet than the Holy Prophet is not
	correct.

	to a person which he does not have, or an error which he has not
	committed. The Holy Prophet also has explained it. According to Abu
	Da'ud and Tirmidhi, when he was asked as to what is ghibat
	(backbiting), he replied: 'It is to make mention of your brother in
	a manner derogatory to him. &quot; The questioner said, &quot;And if
	the fault is there in my brother?&quot; . The Holy Prophet replied:
	`If the fault that you mentioned is there in him, you backbite him;
	if it is not there, you slandered him.&quot; Such an act is not only
	a moral sin, which will entail punishment in the Hereafter, but this

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote110sym" HREF="#sdfootnote110anc">110</A>Jilbab
	is a large sheet and idna' is to draw close and wrap up, but when
	this word is used with the associating particle ala, it gives the
	meaning of letting something down from above. Some modern
	translators, under the influence of the West, have translated this
	word &quot;to wrap up&quot; so as to avoid somehow the Command about
	covering of the face. But if Allah had meant what these gentlemen
	want to construe, He would have said: yudnina ilai-hinna and not
	yudnina alai-hinna. Anyone who knows Arabic knows that yudnina
	'alai-hinna cannot merely mean &quot;wrapping up. &quot; Moreover,
	the words min jalabib-i hinna also do not permit of this meaning. It
	is obvious that the preposition min here signifies a part of the
	sheet, and also that wrapping up is done by means of a whole sheet
	and not merely by a part of it. The verse, therefore, clearly means
	: The women should wrap themselves up well in their sheets, and
	should draw and let down a part of the sheet in front of the face. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This same
	meaning was understood by the major commentators who lived close to
	the time of the Holy Prophet. Ibn Jarir and Ibn al-Mundhir have
	related that Muhammad bin Sirin asked Hadrat `Ubaidah as-Salmani the
	meaning of this verse. (This Hadrat `Ubaidah had become a Muslim in
	the time of the Holy Prophet but had not been able to visit him. He
	came to Madinah in the time of Hadrat 'Umar and settled down there.
	He was recognized as equal in rank with Qadi Shuraih in
	jurisprudence and judicial matters). Instead of giving a verbal
	reply Hadrat 'Ubaidah put on his sheet and gave a practical
	demonstration by covering his head and forehead and face and an eye,
	leaving only the other eye uncovered. Ibn 'Abbas also has made
	almost the same commentary. In his statements which have been
	reported by Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn Marduyah, he says: &quot;Allah has
	commanded the women that when they move .out of their houses for an
	outdoor duty, they should conceal their faces by drawing and letting
	down aver themselves a part of their sheets, keeping only the eyes
	uncovered. &quot; The same explanation of this verse has been given
	by Qatadah and Suddi. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">All the
	great commentators who have passed after the period of the
	Companions and their immediate followers have given the same meaning
	of this verse. Imam Ibn Jarir Tabari, in his commentary of this
	verse, says: &quot;The respectable women should not look like the
	slave-girls from their dress when they move out of their houses,
	with uncovered faces and loose hair; they should rather draw and Iet
	down over them a part of their sheets or outer-garments so that no
	evil person may dare molest them.&quot; (Jami'al Bayan, vol. XXII,
	p. 33).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">'Allama
	Abu Bakr al-Jassas says: &quot;This verse points out that the young
	woman has been commanded to conceal her face from the other men;
	when moving out of the house she should cover herself up well to
	express chastity and purity of character so that people of doubtful
	character do not cherish any false hope when they see her. &quot;
	(Ahkam al-Qur'an, vol. III, p. 458). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">'Allama
	Zamakhshari says: &quot;It means that they should let down a part of
	their sheet over themselves, and should cover their faces and wrap
	up their sides well.&quot; (AI-Kashshaf, vol. II, p. 221). 'Allama
	Nizamuddin Nishapuri says: &quot;That is, they should let down a
	part of the sheet over them: in this verse, the women have been
	commanded to cover the head and face. &quot; (Ghara'ib al-Qur an,
	vol. XXII, p. 32).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Imam Razi
	says: &quot;What is mean is that the people may know that they are
	not promiscuous women. For the woman who covers her face, though the
	face is not included in the satar, cannot be expected to uncover her
	satar, which is obligatory to cover before the other man. Thus,
	everyone will know that they are modest and virtuous women who
	cannot be expected to do anything indecent.&quot; (Tafsir Kabir.

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Incidentally,
	another thing that is proved by this verse is that the Holy Prophet
	had several daughters, for Allah Himself says: &quot;O Prophet,
	enjoin your wives and daughters.&quot; These words absolutely refute
	the assertion of those people who without any fear of God make the
	claim that the Holy Prophet had only one daughter, Hadrat Fatimah,
	and the other daughters were not froth his own loins but by the
	former husbands. These people are so blinded by prejudice that they
	do not even bother to consider what crime they arc committing by
	denying the parentage of the children of the Holy Prophet, and what
	severe punishment will await them in the Hereafter. AII authentic
	traditions concur that from Hadrat Khadijah the Holy Prophet had not
	one daughter, Hadrat Fatimah, but three other daughters as well. The
	Holy Prophet's earliest biographer, Muhammad bin Ishaq, after
	mentioning his marriage with Hadrat Khadijah, says; &quot;She was
	the mother of all the Holy Prophet's children except Ibrahim, namely
	Qasim and Tahir and Tayyib and Zainab and Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum
	and Fatimah.&quot; (Ibn Hisham, vol. I, p. 202). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	famous genealogist, Hashim bin Muhammad bin as-Sa'ib al-Kalbi,
	states: 'The first born child to the, Messenger. of Allah before his
	call to Prophethood was Qasim; then Zainab was born to him, then
	Ruqayyah, then Umm Kulthum.&quot; (Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, vol. I, p.
	133). Ibn Hazam writes in Jawami' asSirah that from Hadrat Khadijah
	the Holy Prophet had four daughters, the eldest being Zainab, then
	Ruqayyah, then Fatimah and then Umm Kulthum (pp. 38-39). Tabari, Ibn
	Sa'd, Abu Ja'far Muhammad bin Habib (author of Kitab al-Muhabbar)
	and Ibn 'Abd al-Bart (author of Kitab al-lsti'ab) state on the
	strength of authentic sources that before her marriage with the Holy
	Prophet Hadrat Khadijah had two husbands, Abu Halah Tamimi by whom
	she had a son named Hind bin Abu Halah, and 'Atiq bin 'A'idh
	Makhzumi, by whom she had a daughter named Hind. Then she was
	married to the Holy Prophet and all the genealogists agree that from
	his loins she had the four daughters as stated above. (See Tabari,
	vol. ll, p. 411: tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, vol. VIII, pp. 14-16; Kitab
	al-Muhabbar, pp. 78, 79, 452; .9l-Isti'ab, vol. II, p. 718). AII
	these statements are authenticated by the Qur'anic declaration that
	the Holy Prophet had not one but several daughters.&nbsp;

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Let us
	pause here for a while and try to understand what spirit of the
	social law of Islam is being expressed by this Qur'anic Command and
	what is its object which Allah Himself has stated. Before this in
	Surah An-Nur: 31, the women have been forbidden to display their
	adornments before others except such and such men and women, and
	&quot;also that they should not stamp their feet on the ground lest
	their hidden decoration (ornaments) should be known.&quot; If that
	Command is read with this verse of AI-Ahzab it becomes obvious that
	the intention of the Command for the woman to cover herself well
	with the sheet here is to conceal her adornments from others. And,
	evidently, this purpose can be fulfilled only if the sheet or the
	outer-garment itself is simple; otherwise wrapping up oneself with a
	decorated and attractive sheet will defeat the purpose itself.
	Besides, Allah does not only command the woman to conceal her
	adornment by covering herself with the sheet, but also enjoins that
	she should let down a pan of the sheet over herself. No sensible
	person can take any other meaning of this Command than that it
	requires to conceal the face along with the concealment of the
	adornments of the body and dress. Then, Allah Himself states the
	reason for enjoining the Command, saying: &quot;This is an
	appropriate way by adopting which the Muslim women will be
	recognized and will remain safe from trouble.&quot; Evidently, this
	instruction is being given to those women who regard flirtation and
	stares and evil advances by men as annoying and troublesome and not
	as enjoyable, who do not want to be counted among ill-reputed,
	immodest society girls, but wish to be known as chaste and modest
	domestic women. To such noble and pious women Allah says: 'If you
	really wish to be known as good women, and the men's lustful
	attention is not pleasurable but embarrassing for you, then you
	should not come out of your houses in full make-up like the
	newly-wed brides so as to display your beauty and physical charms
	before the greedy eyes of the people, but the best way for this
	would be that you should come out in a simple sheet fully concealing
	your adornments and covering your face and walking in a manner that
	even the jingle of your ornaments does not attract attention. The
	woman who applies herself to make-up and does not step out of the
	house until she has fully embellished and decorated herself with
	every adornment cannot have any other intention that to become the
	center of attention of all the men, whom she herself allures. After
	this if she complains that the greedy looks of the people cause
	embarrassment to her, and she does not wish to be known as a
	&quot;society woman&quot; and a &quot;popular lady&quot;, but wants
	to live as a chaste house-wife, it will be nothing but a fraud. It
	is not the word of the mouth of a person that determines his
	intention, but his real intention is manifested in his act and mode
	of behavior. Therefore, the act of the woman who appears before the
	other then attractively itself shows what motivates her behavior.
	That is why the mischievous people cherish the same hopes from her
	as can be cherished from such a woman. The Qur'an tells the women:
	&quot;You cannot be chaste women and society women at one and the
	same time. If you want to live as modest, chaste women, you will
	have to give up the ways that are conducive to becoming society
	women only, and adopt the way of life that can be helpful in
	becoming chaste women. &quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Whether a
	man's personal opinion is according to the Qur'an or opposed to it,
	and whether he wants to accept the Qur'anic guidance as a practical
	guide for himself or not, in any case if he does not wish to be
	intellectually dishonest in interpreting the Qur'an, he cannot fail
	to understand its real intention. If he is not a hypocrite he will
	frankly admit that the Qur'an's intention is what has been stated
	above. After this if he violates any Command, he will do so with the
	realization that he is violating the Qur'anic Command, or regards

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The

	creations. The earth and the sun and the moon and the mountains are
	dumb, deaf and lifeless for us but they may not be so also for
	Allah. Allah can speak to each of His creations and it can respond
	to Him, though its nature is incomprehensible for us. Therefore, it
	is just possible that Allah, in fact, might have presented this

	possible that before this present life Allah might have given
	another kind of existence to mankind and summoned it before Himself,
	and it might have willingly undertaken to accept the delegated
	powers and authority. We have no rational argument to regard this as
	impossible. Only such a person, who might have made a wrong estimate

	shall so conceal Myself from him as if I did not exist at all. And
	to exercise this freedom I shall invest him with vast powers, great
	capabilities, and shall give him dominion over countless of My
	creations so that he may raise any storm that he may in the

	suffer a most terrible punishment; and the one who will have adopted
	My obedience in spite of all chances and opportunities for
	disobedience, will be raised to such high ranks as no creation of

	to undergo this test?&quot;</P>

	at all of how great a responsibility he is shouldering, and what
	consequences he will encounter of the right or wrong decisions that
	he makes in choosing and adopting an attitude for himself in the
	life of the world. He is ignorant because the fool holds himself as
