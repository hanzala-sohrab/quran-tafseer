subject matter and style resemble those of the earliest Surahs
revealed at Makkah, but it contains a pointer which indicates that it
was sent down in the period when the disbelievers of Makkah had
resolved to oppose the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace), and

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this Surah a vast subject has been compressed into a few brief
sentences, and it is a miracle of the Quran that a complete ideology
of life which could hardly be explained in a thick volume has been
abridged most effectively in brief sentences of this short Surah. Its
theme is to explain the true position of man in the world and of the
world in relation to man and to tell that God has shown to man both
the highways of good and evil, has also provided for him the means to
judge and see and follow them, and now it rests upon mans own effort
and judgment whether he chooses the path of virtue and reaches
felicity or adopts the path of vice and meets with doom. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">First,
the city of Makkah and the hardships being faced therein by the Holy
Prophet (upon whom be peace) and the state of the children of Adam
have been cited as a witness to the truth that this world is not a
place of rest and ease for man, where he might have been born to
enjoy life, but here he has been created into toil and struggle. If
this theme is read with verse 39 of Surah An-Najm (</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Laisa

there is nothing for man but what he has striven for), it becomes
plain that in this world the future of man depends on his toil and
struggle, effort and striving. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this, man's misunderstanding that he is all in all in this world and
that there is no superior power to watch what he does and to call him
to account, has been refuted. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
taking one of the many moral concepts of ignorance held by man, as an
example, it has been pointed out what wrong criteria of merit and
greatness he has proposed for himself in the world. The person who
for ostentation and display squanders heaps of wealth, not only
himself prides upon his extravagances but the people also admire him
for it enthusiastically, whereas the Being Who is watching over his
deeds, sees by what methods he obtained the wealth and in what ways
and with what motives and intention he spent it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
Allah says: We have given man the means of knowledge and the
faculties of thinking and understanding and opened up before him both
the highways of virtue and vice: one way leads down to moral
depravity, and it is an easy way pleasing for the self; the other way
leads up to moral heights, which is steep like an uphill road, for
scaling which man has to exercise self- restraint. It is man's
weakness that he prefers slipping down into the abyss to scaling the
cliff. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
Allah has explained what the steep road is by following which man can
ascend to the heights. It is that he should give up spending for
ostentation, display and pride and should spend his wealth to help
the orphans and the needy, should believe in Allah and His Religion
and joining the company of believers should participate in the
construction of a society which should fulfill the demands of virtue
and righteousness patiently and should be compassionate to the
people. The end of those who follow this way is that they would
become worthy of Allah's mercies. On the contrary, the end of those
who follow the wrong way, is the fire of Hell from which there is no
escape. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	we have explained in E.N.1 of Surah AI-Qiyamah above, to begin a
	discourse with a &quot;Nay&quot; and resume it with an oath means
	that the people were asserting a wrong thing to refute which it was
	said: &quot;Nay, the truth is not that which you seem to assert, but
	I swear by such and such a thing that the truth is this and this&quot;
	As for the question what it was to refute which this discourse was
	sent down, it is indicated by the theme that follows. The
	disbelievers of Makkah said that there was nothing wrong with the
	way of life that they were following, as if to say: &quot;Eat, drink
	and be merry for tomorrow we die in the natural process of time.
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace), without any reason, is

	punished accordingly.&quot;&nbsp;

	why an oath was being sworn by this City. The people of Makkah were
	well aware of the background and importance of their city and knew
	how in the midst of desolate mountains, in an un-cultivated, barren
	valley, the Prophet Abraham had brought his wife and suckling child
	and left them there without any support; how he had built a House
	there and proclaimed to the people to visit it as pilgrims when
	there was no soul for miles around to hear the proclamation, and
	then how this city had eventually become the commercial and

	the words &quot;father and children he begot&quot; have been used

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>This
	is that for which the oaths as mentioned above have been sworn.
	Man's being created in toil means that man in this world has not
	been created to enjoy himself and live a life of ease and comfort,
	but the world for him is a place of enduring and undergoing toil,
	labor and hardship, and no man can be immune from this. The city of
	Makkah is a witness that a servant of Allah toiled and struggled
	hard, then only did it become a city and the center of Arabia. In
	this city of Makkah the condition of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
	peace) is a witness that he is enduring every kind of hardship for
	the sake of a mission; so much so that there is full peace here for
	the wild animals but no peace for him. Then, every man's survival,
	from the tithe he is conceived in the mother's womb till the last
	breath of life, is a witness that he has to pass through trouble,
	toil, labor, dangers and hardships at every step. The most fortunate
	of us is also exposed to grave dangers of death before birth or of
	elimination by abortion while in the mother's womb. At birth he is
	only a hair-breadth away from death. After birth he is so helpless
	that had there not been somebody to look after him, he would perish
	uncared for and un-noticed. When he became able to walk he stumbled
	at every step. Froth childhood to youth and old age he had to pass
	through such physical changes that if any change had taken a wrong
	turn, his very life would have been at stake. Even if he is a king
	or a dictator, he at no time enjoys internal peace from the tear
	that a rebellion might arise against him somewhere. Even if he is a
	conqueror he is never at peace from the danger that one of his
	generals might rise in revolt against him Even if he is a Korah of
	his time, he is ever anxious to increase his wealth and to safeguard
	it. Thus, there is no one who may he enjoying perfect peace freely
	and without hesitation, for man indeed has been created into a life
	of toil and trouble.&nbsp;

	before the occurrence of the Hereafter in this world itself, he sees
	that his destiny every moment is being ruled by some other Being
	against Whose decrees all his plans and designs prove ineffective. A
	single jolt of the earthquake, a blast of wind, a flood in the river
	and a sea-storm are enough to show how weak and feeble man is
	against the Divine forces. A sudden accident can reduce a strong and
	robust person to a cripple; one turn of the fortune deposes a mighty
	sovereign froth the position of authority. When the fortunes of the
	nations, which have climbed to the very apex of glory and
	prosperity, change, they are humiliated and disgraced even in the
	world where do one could dare look them in the face. How has then
	this man been deluded into thinking that no one else can have power

	wealth and expression of his pride and glory. Bestowing rich awards
	on , poetic admirers, inviting and feeding hundreds of thousands of
	people on marriage and death ceremonies, gambling away heaps of
	wealth, attending festivals with large entourages, trying to excel
	others in display of glory and grandeur, having heaps of food cooked
	on ceremonial occasions and throwing invitations to all and sundry

	in the foregoing verses the extravagances of man which he indulges
	in for ostentation and expression of superiority to others, have
	been mentioned, now here it is being stated as to what expenditure
	of wealth it is which leads man up to moral heights instead of
	causing him to sink into moral depravity and perversion. But in this
	there is no enjoyment for the self; on the contrary, man has to
	exercise self-restraints and make sacrifices. The expenditure is
	that one should set a slave free, or should render a slave monetary
	help so as to enable him to win his freedom by paying the ransom, or
	free a debtor from his debt, or secure release of a helpless person
	without means from penalties. Likewise, the expenditure is that one
	should feed a nearly related orphan (i.e. an orphan who is either a
	relative or a neighbor) who is hungry, and a needy, helpless person
	who might have been reduced to extreme poverty and might have none
	to support and help him. Helping such people does not win a person
	fame and reputation, nor feeding them brings him the admiration for
	being wealthy and generous which one usually wins by holding
	banquets to thousands of well-to-do people. But the path to moral
	and spiritual heights passes on steep uphill roads only.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Great
	merits of the acts of virtue mentioned in these verses have been
	described by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace). For
	instance, about fakku raqabah (fleeing a neck from bondage) many
	ahadith have been related in the traditions, one of which is a
	tradition from Hadrat Abu Hurairah, to the effect; &quot;The Holy
	Prophet said: The person who set a believing slave free, Allah will
	save from fire of Hell every limb of his body in lieu of every limb
	of the slave's body, the hand in lieu of the hand, the foot in lies
	of the foot, the private parts in lieu of the private parts &quot;
	(Musnad, Ahmad, Bukhari. Muslim, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i). Hadrat 'Ali bin
	Husain (lmam Zain al-`Abedin) asked Sa`d bin Marjanah, the reporter
	of this Hadith: &quot;Did you hear it yourself from Abu Hurairah?&quot;
	When 6e replied in the affirmative, Imam Zain al-`Abedin called out
	his most valuable slave and set him free there and then. According
	to Muslim, he had an offer often thousand dirhams for the slave. On
	the basis of this verse, Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Sha`bi have
	ruled: &quot;Setting a slave free is superior to giving away
	charity, for Allah has mentioned it before the mention of charity.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The Holy
	Prophet has mentioned the merits of rendering help to the needy in
	many ahadith, one of which is this Hadith from Hadrat Abu Hurairah:
	&quot;The Holy Prophet said: The one who strives in the cause of
	rendering help to the widow and the needy is like the one who
	endeavors and strives in the cause of jihad for the sake of Allah.
	(And Hadrat Abu Hurairah says :) I think that the Holy Prophet also
	said: He is even like him who keeps standing up in the Prayer
	constantly, without ever taking rest, and like him who observes the
	fast continuously without ever breaking it:&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim).
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the orphans, there are numerous sayings reported from the Holy
	Prophet. Hadrat Sahl bin Sa`d has reported: &quot;The Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) said: I and the one who supports a nearly
	related of un-related orphan, shall stand in Paradise like
	this-saying this he raised his index finger and the middle finger,
	keeping them a little apart.&quot; (Bukhari). Hadrat Abu HIurairah
	has reported this saying of the Holy Prophet: &quot;The best among
	the Muslim homes is the home wherein an orphan is treated well and
	the worst the one wherein an orphan is mistreated.&quot; (Ibn Majah,
	Bukhari in Al-Adab al- Mufrad). Hadrat Abu Umamah says that the Holy
	Prophet said: &quot;The one who passed his hand on the head of an
	orphan, only for the sake of Allah, will have as many acts of virtue
	recorded in his favour as the number of the hair on which his hand
	passed, and the one who treated an orphan boy or girl well. will
	stand in Paradise with me like this...saying this the Holy Prophet
	joined his two fingers together.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi). Ibn
	'Abbas says: The Holy Prophet said: &quot;The one who made an orphan
	join him in eating and drinking, Allah will make Paradise obligatory
	for him unless he commits a sin which cannot be forgiven.&quot;
	(Sharh as-Sunnah).Hadrat Abu Hurairah says: A man complained before
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace), saying: &quot;I am
	hard-hearted.&quot; The Holy Prophet said to him: &quot;Treat the
	orphan with kindness and love and feed the needy one.&quot; (Musnad

<DIV ID="sdfootnote13">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote13sym" HREF="#sdfootnote13anc">13</A>That
	is, &quot;In addition to these qualities it is essential that one
	should be a believer, for without faith no act is an act of virtue,
	nor acceptable in the sight of Allah. At numerous places in the
	Qur'an it has been stated that only such an act of virtue is
	appreciable and becomes a means of salvation as is accompanied by
	faith. In .Surah An-Nisa', for example, it has been said: &quot;The
	one who does good deeds, whether man or woman, provided that the one
	is a believer, will enter Paradise (v. 1245.)&quot; In Surah
	An-Nahl: &quot;Whosoever does righteous deeds, whether male or
	female, provided that he is a believer, We shall surely grant him to
	live a pure life in this world, and We will reward such people (in
	the Hereafter) according to their best deeds&quot; (v. 97). In Surah
	Al-Mu'min: &quot;Whoever does good, whether man or woman, provided
	that he is a believer, all such people shall enter Paradise wherein
	they shall be provided without measure.&quot; (v : 4U). Whoever
	studies the Qur'an, will see that in this Book wherever the good
	reward of a righteous act has been mentioned, it has always been
	made conditional upon the faith, a good act without faith; has
	nowhere been regarded as acceptable to God, nor has any hope been
	given for a reward for it.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, the
	following important point also should not remain hidden from view:
	In this verse it has not been said: &quot;Then he believed&quot;,
	but: &quot;Then he joined those who believed.' This means that mere
	believing as an individual and remaining content with it is not what
	is desired; what is desired is that every new believer should join
	those who have already believed so as to form a party of the
	believers, to bring about a believing society, which should work for
	establishing the virtues and wiping out the vices as demanded by the
	faith.&nbsp;

</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote14">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote14sym" HREF="#sdfootnote14anc">14</A>These
	are two of the important characteristics of the believing society,
	which have been expressed in two brief sentences. The first
	characteristic is that its members should exhort one another to
	patience, and the second that they should exhort one another to
	compassion and mercy. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	patience, we have explained at many places that in view of the
	extensive meaning in which the Qur'an has used this word, the entire
	life of a believer is a life of patience. As soon as a man stops on
	to the path of the faith, test of his patience starts. Patience is
	required to be exercised in performing the acts of worship enjoined
	by Allah patience is needed in carrying out the commands of Allah;
	abstention from the things forbidden by Allah is not possible
	without patience; patience is needed in abandoning the moral evils
	and in adopting the pure morals; temptations to sin faced at every
	step can be resisted only by recourse to patience. On countless
	occasions in life obedience to God's law entails losses, troubles,
	hardships and deprivations, and disobedience to the law seems to
	bring benefits and pleasures. Without patience no believer can fare
	well on such occasions. Then, as soon as a believer has adopted the
	way of the faith, he has to meet with resistance not only from his
	own self and personal desires but also from his children, family,
	society, country and nation and from the base-hearted among men and
	jinn of the entire world; so much so that he is even required to
	abandon his country and undertake Jihad in the cause of God. Under
	all these conditions only the quality of patience can cause a man to
	remain steadfast to principles. Now, obviously, if every believer
	individually was put to such a hard test, he would be faced with the
	danger of defeat at every step and world hardly be able to pass
	through the test successfully. On the contrary, if there existed a
	believing society every member of which was not only himself
	possessed of patience but all its members also were .supporting one
	another mutually in the test of patience, successes would fall to
	its lot, a tremendous power would be generated to face the evil, a
	mighty force of good individuals would be ready to help bring the
	entire society on to the path of virtue and righteousness.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	mercy and compassion, it is the distinctive feature of the society
	of believers that they are not a hard-hearted, merciless and unjust
	people but a society whose members are merciful and compassionate.
	to humanity at large and sympathetic and friendly among themselves.
	A believer as an individual is an embodiment of Allah's quality of
	mercy and the group of the believers as a party also is a
	representative of Allah's Messenger, who has been described thus: &quot;O
	Muhammad, We have sent you to be a real blessing for the people of
	the world.&quot; (AI-Anbiya': 107). The highest moral quality which
	the Holy Messenger (upon whom be Allah's peace) tried his utmost to
	inculcate among his followers was this very quality of mercy.
	Consider - the following of his sayings, which show what importance
	he attached to it. Hadrat Jarir bin `Abdullah says that the Holy
	Messenger (upon whom be peace) said: &quot;Allah does not show mercy
	to him who does not show mercy to others.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim).</P>
