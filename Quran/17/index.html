for the previous twelve years and his opponents had been doing all
they could to make his Mission a failure, but in spite of all their
opposition, Islam had spread to every corner of Arabia and there was
hardly any clan which had not been influenced by his invitation. In
Makkah itself the true Believers had formed themselves into a small
community and were ready and willing to face every danger to make
Islam a success. Besides them, a very large number of the people of
Aus and Khazraj (two influential clans of Al-Madinah) had accepted
Islam. Thus the time had come for the Holy Prophet to emigrate from
Makkah to Al- Madinah and there gather together the scattered Muslims
and establish a state based on the principles of Islam. </FONT></SPAN>

disbelievers of Makkah had been admonished to take a lesson from the
miserable end of the Israelites and other communities and mend their
ways within the period of respite given by Allah, which was about to
expire. They should, therefore, accept the invitation that was being
extended by Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) and the Quran.
Otherwise they shall be annihilated and replaced by other people.
Incidentally, the Israelites, with whom Islam was going to come in
direct contact in the near future at Al-Madinah have also been warned
that they should learn a lesson from the chastisements that have
already been inflicted on them. They were warned, &quot;Take
advantage of the Prophethood of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him)
because that is the last opportunity which is being given to you. If
even now you behave as you have been behaving, you shall meet with a
painful torment.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

life-after- death and Prophethood. Accordingly, convincing arguments
have been put forward to prove that the Quran is the Book of Allah
and its teachings are true and genuine the doubts of the disbelievers
about these basic realities have been removed and on suitable
occasions they have been admonished and rebuked in regard to their
ways of ignorance. </FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this connection, those fundamental principles of morality and
civilization on which the Islamic System of life is meant to be
established have been put forward. Thus this was a sort of the
Manifesto of the intended Islamic state which had been proclaimed a
year before its actual establishment. It has been explicitly stated
that that was the sketch of the system on which Muhammad (Allah's
peace be upon him) intended to build human life first in his own
country and then in the outside world. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Besides
these, the Holy Prophet has been instructed to stick firmly to his
stand without minding the opposition and difficulties which he was
encountering and should never think of making a compromise with
unbelief. The Muslims who sometimes showed signs of impatience, when
they met with persecution, calumny, and crooked arguments, have also
been instructed to face adverse circumstances with patience and
fortitude and keep full control over their feelings and passions.
Moreover, salat was prescribed in order to reform and purify their
souls, as if to say, &quot;This is the thing which will produce in
you those high qualities of character which are essential for
everyone who intends to struggle in the righteous way Incidentally,
we learn from Traditions that Mi'raj was the first occasion on which
the five daily Prayers were prescribed to be offered at fixed times.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

Before this We had given the Book to Moses and made it a means of
guidance for the Israelites<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A>
with this Command: &quot;Do not make .any other guardian than
Myself.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A>
You are the descendants of those whom We bore in the Ark with Noah,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A>
and he was truly a grateful servant&quot;. Besides this, We
forewarned the Israelites in the Scriptures:<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote5anc" HREF="#sdfootnote5sym"><SUP>5</SUP></A>
You will work great mischief twice in the land and will become
overbearingly arrogant.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote6anc" HREF="#sdfootnote6sym"><SUP>6</SUP></A>
When the occasion of the first of the two mischiefs came, O
Israelites, We raised against you such of Our servants who were very
mighty and formidable; so they penetrated through all parts of your
country. This was a warning that was bound to be fulfilled.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote7anc" HREF="#sdfootnote7sym"><SUP>7</SUP></A>
Then after this We afforded you an opportunity to over-power them and
helped you with abundance of riches and children and increased you
far more in numbers than before.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote8anc" HREF="#sdfootnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
Behold! If you did good it proved to be good for yourselves and if
you committed evil it proved to be bad for your own selves. Then,
when the time came for the fulfillment of the second warning, We set
other enemies on you so that they might disfigure your faces and
enter into the Temple just as the former enemies had entered and
destroyed whatever they could lay their hands on.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote9anc" HREF="#sdfootnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
Now again your Lord may show compassion on you; but if you again
repeat your former behavior; We will again visit you with. Our

Indeed the Qur'an shows that way which is perfectly straight: To
those who believe in it and do good deeds, it gives the good news

been made ready for them.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote11anc" HREF="#sdfootnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>The
	event referred to in this verse is known &quot;Mi`raj&quot; and
	&quot;Isra&quot;'. According to authentic traditions, this took
	place a year before Hijrah. In the traditional and biographical
	literature, its details have been related by a large number (25) of
	the Companions. Anas bin Malik, Malik bin Sa`asa`ah, Abuzar Ghifari,
	and Abu Hurairah (Allah be pleased with them all) have related
	details of the event. Besides them, `Umar, `Ali, `Abdullah bin
	Mas`ud...........(Allah be pleased with them) have also related some
	parts of this event.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	verse, the Qur'an mentions only a part of the Journey, i.e., from
	Masjid-i-Haram to the Temple at Jerusalem. The object of this
	journey as stated here was that Allah willed to show His servant
	some of His signs. The Qur'an does not give any details other than
	this but we find further details in the traditions, which are to
	this effect:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One night
	the Angel Jibril transported the Holy Prophet on al-Buraq from
	Masjid-i-Haram to Masjid-i-Aqsa (the Temple). There the Holy Prophet
	offered his prayers along with the other Prophets. Then he took him
	towards the higher spheres, where he met some of the great Prophets
	in different spheres. At last he reached the Highest Place in the
	Heavens, and was received in audience by Allah. It was there that
	besides other important instructions five daily Prayers were
	prescribed. Then he returned to the Temple and from there came back
	to Masjid-i-Haram. During this Journey, according to many
	traditions, Paradise and Hell were shown to him. We also learn from
	authentic traditions that on the following day when he mentioned
	this event, the disbelievers of Makkah scoffed at him, and some of
	the Muslims also were skeptical about this.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The above
	additional details based on the traditions cannot be said to be
	against the Qur'an, for these are additions to the details given in
	the Qur'an; therefore, the details related in the traditions cannot
	be. rejected on the plea that they are against the Qur'an.
	Nevertheless, if one rejects any part of those details which are
	given in the traditions, one cannot be declared a renegade. On the
	other hand, if one rejects the details given in the Qur'an, one does
	become a renegade.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There are
	different versions of this Journey. Some say that this happened in a
	dream, while others are of the opinion that the Holy Prophet was
	fully awake and went on the Journey with his own physical body; some
	others say that it was merely a mystic vision which was shown to
	him. The opening words of this verse: &quot;Glory be to Him, who
	transported His Servant...&quot; however, clearly show that it was a
	super-natural event which was brought about by the unlimited power
	of Allah. It is quite obvious that if the event had been merely a
	mystic vision, it would not have been introduced by the words which
	imply that the Being Who brought about this event is free from each
	and every kind of weakness and defect. Again the words &quot;transported
	His servant one night&quot; also show that this was not a dream or a
	vision but a physical journey in which Allah arranged that the Holy
	Prophet should make observation of His Signs with his physical eyes.
	Therefore, one is bound to admit that this was not a mere spiritual
	experience but a physical journey and visual observation which Allah
	arranged for His Prophet.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is
	strange that some people are of the opinion that this extraordinary
	journey could not be possible, but now when man with his
	limited-very limited power has been able to reach the moon, it is
	absurd to deny that Allah with His limitless powers could enable His
	Messenger to make this journey in the extraordinary short time it
	took.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Above
	all, the question whether a thing is possible or not, can arise only
	in the `case of human beings whose powers are after all limited, but
	such questions cannot be raised where the All-Powerful Allah is
	concerned. Only such a person who does not believe that Allah is
	able to do everything can raise objections against this wonderful
	Journey about which Allah Himself says that He transported His
	Servant one night from Masjid-i-Haram to Masjid-i-Aqsa. Likewise all
	the objections raised against the various details which are given in
	the traditions are frivolous, except two, which are plausible:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, if
	we accept these details, then we shall have to admit drat Allah is
	confined to a certain place: otherwise there was no need that His
	Servant should be transported for this purpose to a certain place.
	Secondly, according to traditions, the Holy Prophet was enabled to
	observe Paradise and Hell where he saw some people suffering from
	torment. The objection is: why should sane people be awarded
	punishments or rewards before the Final Judgment after Resurrection?</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the first objection, it is true that Allah is Infinite by
	Himself, but in dealing with His creation, He employs those means
	which suit His imperfect creation not because of any limitation of
	His, but because of the limitations of His creation. For instance,
	when He speaks to any of His creature, He adopts the same limited
	mode of conversation as the addressee can understand, though He has
	limitless modes of speech. Likewise, when He desires to show some of
	the wonderful Signs of His Kingdom to a servant. He transports him
	to the place where the' Signs are to be shown. It is obvious that
	the servant cannot see at one and the same time the whole of the
	universe as Allah does, for Allah has no need to go to any place at
	all for this purpose but the servant has. The same applies to the
	appearance of the servant before the Creator. Though Allah is not
	confined to any locality, it is necessary for the servant to go to
	the place where His manifestations have been concentrated for his
	observation because it is not possible for the servant with his
	limited powers to go in His Presence in His Infinite Capacity.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the second objection, it is based on the lack of
	understanding the thing: many of the Signs which were shown to the
	Holy Prophet were symbolical. For instance, a small hole from which
	a fat ox came out but could not go back into it, represented
	mischief personified. In the same way the adulterers were shown as
	if they had fresh meat before them but instead of that they were
	eating rotten flesh. Similarly punishments for evil deeds shown to
	him were only symbolic observations of the punishments in the
	Hereafter so that he might see in advance the things which would
	take place in the Hereafter.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In regard
	to the Mi `raj it should be kept in view that all the Prophets were
	enabled by Allah to see His Signs in the heavens and the earth
	according to their ranks. And for this purpose all the material
	curtains were lifted so that they could see with their naked eyes
	the unseen realities, to which they were required to invite the
	people.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This was
	done so that the Prophets could say with full conviction what they
	had seen with their own eyes. For this experience would distinguish
	there from a philosopher who bases all his theories on guess-work
	and cannot say that he bears witness to what he claims. In contrast
	to philosophers, Prophets could say that they bore witness to the
	things which they presented because they had seen them with their
	own eyes.</P>

	context of the theme of the whole Surah, we can easily understand
	the connection between the two. .The main object of this Surah is to
	give a warning to the disbelievers of Makkah. That is why the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When this
	mischief actually carne to pass, Prophet lsaiah warned them of its
	ruinous consequences: &quot;Ah sinful nation, a people laden with
	iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that arc corrupters: they
	have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel
	unto anger, they are gone away backward. Why should ye be stricken
	any more? ye will revolt more and more: How is the faithful city
	become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in
	it; but now murderers. Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of
	thieves: everyone loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they
	judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come
	unto them. Therefore, saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the mighty
	One of Israel. Ah I will case me of mine adversaries, and avenge me
	of mine enemies: they be replenished from the east, and are
	soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the
	children of strangers. Their land also is full of idols; they
	worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers
	have made: Moreover the Lord saith, Because the daughters of Zion
	are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes,
	walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their
	feet: Therefore, the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the
	head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will discover their
	secret parts. Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the
	war. And her gates shall lament and mourn: and she being desolate
	shall sit upon the ground. Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth
	up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king
	of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his
	channels, and go over all his banks: That this is a rebellious
	people, lying children, children that will not hear the law of the
	Lord: Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy
	not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy
	deceits: Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye
	despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and
	stay thereon: Therefore, this iniquity shall be to you as a breach
	ready to fall, . . . . And he shall break it as the breaking of the

	whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away,
	and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah
	feared not, but went and played the harlot also. And it came to pass
	through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land,

	the harlots' houses. They were as fed horses in the morning: every

	of Israel, saith the Lord: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient
	nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understand
	what they say. Their quiver is an open sepulchre, they arc all

	tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the
	midst of thee they commit lewdness. In thee have they discovered
	their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set
	apart for pollution. And one hath committed abomination with his
	neighbor's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his
	daughter-in-law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his
	father's daughter. In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou
	hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy
	neighbors by extortion and hast forgotten me, can thine hands be
	strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? And I will scatter
	thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will
	consume thy filthiness out of thee. And thou shalt take thine
	inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt
	know that I am the Lord.&quot; (Ezekiel, Chapter 22: verses 3, 6-12,

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides
	the above mentioned warnings which were given to Israelites at the
	time of their first mischief, Prophet Jesus Christ warned them of
	the consequences of their second' great mischief. In a forceful
	address he criticized their morel degeneration like this: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;O
	Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest
	them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy
	children together, even as a hen gatherth her chickens under her
	wings, and ye would not! Behold, your house is left unto you
	desolate. Verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one
	stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down. &quot; (Matthew,

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then,
	when the Roman officials were taking Prophet Jesus out for

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But Jesus

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote7sym" HREF="#sdfootnote7anc">7</A>This
	refers to the terrible destruction that the Israelites suffered at
	the hands of the Assyrians and Babylonians. One cannot fully
	appreciate the historical background of this merely from the
	extracts that have been reproduced above from the Books of the
	Prophets. A brief history of the Israelites is also needed so that a
	student may become acquainted with all the causes and circumstances
	on account of which Allah removed this nation, that professed to
	believe in a revealed Book, from the leadership of mankind and
	turned it into a humiliated, condemned and backward community.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When,
	after the death of Prophet Moses, the Israelites entered Palestine
	it was inhabited by the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzittes,
	Hivites, Jebusites, the Philistines, etc. These communities had
	adopted the worst kind of idolatry, their supreme deity being Ayl
	whom they regarded as the father of gods and who was usually
	represented by the bull-images. His consort was called Asherah from
	whom had descended a whole line of gods and goddesses, about 70 in
	number. The most powerful god among them was Baal who was regarded
	as the god of rain and growth and the lord of the earth and heavens.
	In the northern regions his consort was called Anathoth and in
	Palestine Ashtaroth. These two were the goddesses of love and
	procreation. Besides them, there was a god of death, a god of
	disease and famine, and a goddess of health, and thus all the
	worldly powers and agencies stood divided among a large number of
	deities. The people had ascribed such dirty and base qualities and
	acts to these deities that even a worst offender against morality
	would shun being known by them. Obviously the people who have
	adopted such mean deities for worship and devotion cannot remain
	secure from the worst kind of moral degeneration and the modern
	excavations have shown this conclusively.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Child
	sacrifice was a common thing among them. Their places of worship had
	turned into brothels, where women were kept as religious prostitutes
	and illicit relations with them were regarded as a part of worship
	and devotion.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Israelites had clearly been told in the instructions given in the
	Torah that they should destroy those communities and wrest the land
	of Palestine from them, and that they should avoid mixing up with
	those people and ward off their moral and ideological weaknesses:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But when
	the Israelites entered Palestine they set this guidance aside. They
	not only did not establish a united kingdom of their own but fell a
	prey to tribal parochialism. Each of their tribes was content to
	take a part of the captured land and become a separate and
	independent state. This disunity among them did not leave any of the
	tribes strong enough to purge its territory completely of the
	idolaters, and therefore they had to allow them to live side by side
	with them in the same land. Not only this, but there had remained in
	the conquered territories a cumber of small city states of these
	idolatrous communities which the Israelites had nor been able to
	subjugate. It is this very thing which has been complained against
	in the extract of the Psalms reproduced above in the beginning of
	E.N. 6.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The first
	consequence of intermixing with those communities, was that the
	Israelites also became idolatrous, and gradually began to adopt
	other moral evils also. This has been complained about in the Book
	of Judges as below: &quot;And the children of Israel did evil, in
	the sight of the Lord, and served Baalim: And they forsook the Lord
	God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt,
	and followed other gods, the gods of the people that were round
	about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the Lord to
	anger. And they forsook the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtaroth&quot;.
	(Judges, 2: 11-13.)</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second consequence suffered by the Israelites was that the
	communities whose city-states they had left unconquered and the
	Philistines whose land they had not at all touched set up a united
	front against them and drove them out of a major part of Palestine
	by incessant attacks, so much so that they deprived them of the Holy
	Ark of their Lord. At last, the Israelites felt the need of
	Establishing a united kingdom of their own under one ruler, and on
	their request Prophet Samuel appointed Saul as their king in 1020
	B.C. (For details see vv. 246-48 and E.N.'s. 268-270 of AI-Baqarah.)</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	united kingdom was ruled by three kings: Saul (1020 B.C. to 1004.
	B.C.), Prophet David (1004 to 965 B.C.) and Prophet Solomon (365 to
	926 B.C.). These kings brought to completion the mission that had
	been left incomplete by the Israelites after the death of Prophet
	Moses. They annexed all the territories except the Phoenician state
	on the northern and the Philistine state on the southern coast,
	which, of course, became tributaries.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After the
	death of Prophet Solomon the Israelites again adopted the ways of
	the world and fought among themselves and split into two independent
	kingdoms, the kingdom of Israel in the northern Palestine and Jordan
	with Samaria ,as its capital, and the kingdom of Judah in the
	southern Palestine and Edom with Jerusalem as its capital. These
	kingdoms were strife-ridden from the very . beginning and this state
	of affairs persisted till the end.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	rulers and people of the kingdom of Israel were the first to be
	affected grievously by the ideological and moral weaknesses of the
	neighboring communities. Specially after the marriage of its ruler,
	Ahab, with the idolatrous princess Jezebel of Zidon, idolatry and
	other evils began to spread unchecked among the Israelites under the
	official patronage. Prophets Elias and Elisha tried their very best
	to check this deluge but the Israelites who were rapidly
	degenerating, did not heed their warning. At last the wrath of Allah
	overtook the kingdom of Israel in the shape of the Assyrians who
	started subjecting Palestine to incessant attacks from 900 B.C.
	downward. During this period, Prophet Amos (787-747 B.C.) and them
	Prophet Hosea(747-735 B.C.) rose and warned the Israelites again and
	again but the wretched, depraved people did not heed their warnings
	at all, and transgressed all limits. Prophet Amos was banished by
	the king of Israel from the realm of Samaria and warned not to
	preach his mission in the country Not very long after this the wrath
	of Allah burst upon the kingdom of Israel and its people. The
	Assyrian king Sargon took Samaria in 721 B.C.and put an end to this
	northern kingdom. Thousands of Israelites were put to the sword and
	27 thousand of their leading men were driven out of their homeland
	and scattered in the eastern districts of the Assyrian empire and
	replaced by settlers from other parts of the empire. When the
	remaining Israelites intermixed with the settlers they also lost
	gradually their national and cultural identity.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	kingdom of the Israelites, called the kingdom of Judah, which was
	set up in southern Palestine also began to adopt godless ways soon
	after the death of Prophet Solomon, though its moral degeneration
	took place at a slower pace than that of Israel. Therefore, it was
	allowed to exist for a longer period. Then, like the kingdom of
	Israel, it also began to be subjected to continual attacks, its
	cities ruined and its capital besieged, but this kingdom could not
	be wholly destroyed by the Assyrians; it only became a tributary.
	Afterwards, when in spite of the best reformatory efforts of
	Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah the people of Judah did not give up
	idol-worship and other moral evils, king Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon
	attacked and captured the whole of Judah in 598 B.C. including
	Jerusalem and took the king of Judah as prisoner. Even then the
	Israelites did not mend their ways and paid no heed to the warnings
	and guidance of Prophet Jeremiah: Instead of reforming their ways,
	they started making plans to change their fate by revolting against
	Babylon. At last in 587 B.C. Nebuchadnezzar punished them heavily by
	invading Judah and destroyed all its important cities. He razed
	Jerusalem and Solomon's Temple to the ground and did not leave a
	wall of it standing in place. He drove a large part of the Israelite
	population out of their land and scattered them into the adjoining
	countries. The people who were left behind were cursed and subjected
	to all kinds of humiliations by the neighboring communities.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This was
	the first calamity that came as a warning to the Israelites and the
	first chastisement that they suffered as a result therof.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote8">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote8sym" HREF="#sdfootnote8anc">8</A>This
	refers to the lease of time that the Israelites (That is the people
	of Judah) got after their release from the captivity of Babylon. As
	for the people of Israel and Samaria, they did not rise again after
	their moral and spiritual degeneration. But among the people of
	Judah there still were some people who practiced the truth and
	invited others also to follow it. They carried on their work of
	invitation to the truth among the remaining Israelites in Judah and
	exhorted those also to repent and follow the truth who had been
	driven out into Babylon and other lands. At last the mercy of Allah
	came to their help. The downfall of Babylon started. The Persian
	king, Cyrus, took Babylon in 539 B.C. and in the following year
	issued a decree allowing the Israelites to return to and re-settle
	in their homeland. The Israelites began to return home in caravan
	after caravan, and ties continued for along time. Cyrus also allowed
	the Israelites to rebuild the Temple of Solomon but the neighboring
	communities who had settled in this land resisted it. At last
	Darfius I appointed Zerubbabel, a grandson of the last king of
	Judah, governor of Judah in 522 B.C. who got the Temple rebuilt
	under the care of Prophet Haggai, Prophet Zechariah and Joshua. In
	458 B.C. Ezra arrived in Judah along with an exiled group and the
	Persian king Artaxerxes made the following decree.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;And
	thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God that is in thine hand, set
	magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that are
	beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and teach ye
	them that know them not.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And
	whosoever will not do the law of thy God and the law of the king let
	judgment be executed speedily upon him whether it be unto death, or
	to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
	&quot;(Ezra, 7:25-26).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Taking
	advantage of this decree, Ezra carried out the revival of the
	religion of Prophet Moses. He gathered together all the righteous
	and good people from the Israelites and set up a strong
	organization. He compiled and spread the Pentateuch which contained
	the Torah, made arrangements for the religious education of the
	Israelites, enforced the law and started purging the people of moral
	and ideological weaknesses which the had adopted by intermixing with
	the other communities. He compelled they Jews to divorce the
	idolatrous wives they had married, and took a covenant from them
	that they would worship God alone and follow His Law only. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In 455
	B.C. an exiled group came back to Judah under Nehemiah whom the
	Persian king appointed as the ruler of Jerusalem and ordered him to
	build the wall round the city. Thus, after 150 years the Holy city
	was fully restored and became the center of Jewish religion and
	culture, But the Israelites of northern Palestine, and Samaria did
	not benefit by the work of revival done by Ezra. They built a rival
	sanctuary on Mount Gerizim, and tried to make it the religious
	center for the people of the Book. This caused a further, and
	perhaps the final, split Between the Jews and the Samaritans. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The Jews
	suffered a set-back for a while with the fall of the Persian Empire
	and the conquests of Alexander the Great and the rise of the Greeks.
	After the death of Alexander, his kingdom was subdivided into three
	empires. Syria tell to the lot of the Seleucide empire, with Antioch
	as its capital, whose ruler Antiochus III incorporated Palestine
	into his dominions in 198 B.C. These Greek conquerors who were
	idolatrous by precept and freelance morally felt greatly ill at ease
	with the Jewish religion and culture. So, they began to propagate
	the rival Greek way of life and culture by political and economic
	pressure, and were able to win over a strong section of the
	Israelites who became their helpers. This external interference
	caused a split in the Jewish nation. One group among them readily
	adopted the Greek dress, the Greek language, the Greek way of life
	and the Greek sports, while the other persistently stuck to their
	own culture and way of life.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In 175
	B.C. when Antiochus IV (who was called Epiphanes, that is, the
	manifestation of God) came to the throne, he used all his power and
	authority to stamp out the Jewish religion and culture. He got idols
	installed in the Holy Temple at Jerusalem and forced the Jews to
	prostrate themselves before them. He strictly forbade the rite of
	offering the sacrifices at the altar, and commanded the Jews to
	offer sacrifices to idolatrous deities instead. He proposed death
	penalty for those who would keep the Torah in their houses, or
	observe the Sabbath or perform circumcision of their children. But
	the Jews did not yield to this coercion, and started a powerful
	resistance movement, known in history as the revolt of the
	Maccabees. Though in this struggle the sympathies of the
	Greece-oriented Jews were with the Greeks, and they fully cooperated
	with the despots of Antioch to crush the Maccabean revolt, the
	common Jews who still retained the religious fervor of the days of
	Ezra sided with the Maccabees, who were ultimately able to drive out
	the Greeks and establish a free religious state which remained in
	power till 67 B.C This state prospered and in time extended to all
	those territories which had once been under the control the kingdoms
	of Judah and Israel. It was able to annex a part of the land of the
	Philistines which had remained unconquered even in the days of
	Prophets David and Solomon (Peace be upon them).</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote9sym" HREF="#sdfootnote9anc">9</A>The
	historical background of the second degeneration and its
	chastisement is as follows:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The moral
	and religious fervor with which the Maccabees had started their
	movement gradually cooled down and was replaced by love of the world
	and empty external form. A split appeared among them and they
	themselves invited the Roman General, Pompey, to come to Palestine.
	Pompey turned his attention to this land in 63 B.C. and, taking
	Jerusalem, put an end to the political freedom of the Jews. But the
	Roman conquerors preferred to rule their dominions through the
	agency of the local chiefs rather than by direct control. Therefore,
	a local government was set up in Palestine which eventually passed
	into the hand of Herod, a clever Jew, in 40 B.C. This ruler is well
	known as Herod the Great. He ruled over the whole of Palestine and
	Jordan from 40 to 4 B.C. On the one hand Herod patronized the
	religious leaders to please the Jews, and on the other, he
	propagated the Roman culture and won the goodwill of Caesar by
	showing his loyalty and faithfulness to the Roman Empire. During,
	his reign, the Jews degenerated and fell to the lowest ebb of moral
	and religious life.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On the
	death of Herod his kingdom was subdivided into three parts. His son,
	Archelaus, became the ruler of Samaria, Judea and northern Edom. In
	A.D. 6. however, Caesar Augustus deprived him of his authority and
	put the state under his Roman governor, and this arrangement
	continued up till A.D. 41. This was precisely the time when Prophet
	Jesus (Peace be upon him) appeared to reform the Israelites whose
	religious leaders opposed him tooth and nail and even tried to get
	him the death sentence by the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second son of Herod, Herod Antipas, became the ruler of Galilee and
	Jordan in northern Palestine, and he was the person who got Prophet
	Yahya (John) (Peace be upon him) beheaded at the request and desire
	of a dancing girl.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Herod's
	third son, Philip, succeeded to the territories bounded on one side
	by river Yermuk and on the other by Mount Hermon. Philip had been
	much more deeply influenced by the Roman and Greek cultures than his
	father and brothers. Therefore the preaching of the truth could not
	have even so much effect in his land as it had in the other parts of
	Palestine.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In A.D.
	41, the Romans appointed Herod Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the
	Great, ruler of the territories that had once been under Herod
	himself. Coming into power this man did whatever he could to
	persecute the followers of Prophet Jesus (Peace be upon him) and
	used all the forces at his disposal to crush the movement that was
	functioning under the guidance of the Disciples to inculcate fear of
	God in the people and reform their morals.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In order
	to have a correct estimate of the condition of the common Jews and
	their religious leaders, one should study the criticisms leveled by
	Prophet Jesus on them in his sermons contained in the four Gospels.
	Even a religious man like Prophet John was beheaded before their
	eyes and not a voice was raised in protest against this barbarity.
	Then all the religious leaders of the community unanimously demanded
	death sentence for Prophet Jesus, and none but a few righteous men
	were there to mourn this depravity. Above all, when Pontius Pilate
	asked these depraved people, ' which condemned prisoner he should
	release, according to the custom, at Passover, Jesus or Barabbas the
	robber', they all cried with one voice 'Barabbas'. This was indeed
	the last chance Allah gave to the Jews, and then their fate was
	sealed.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Not long
	after this, a serious conflict started between the Jews and the
	Romans, which developed into an open revolt by the former between
	A.D. 64 and G6. Both Herod Agrippa II and the Roman procurator
	Floris failed to put down the rebellion. At last, the Romans crushed
	it by a strong military action and in A.D. 70 Titus took Jerusalem
	by force. About 1,33,000 people were put to the sword, 67 thousand
	made slaves, and thousands sent to work in the Egyptian mines and to
	other cities so that they could be used in amphitheaters for being
	torn by wild beasts or become the &quot;practice-target&quot; for
	the sword fighters. All the tall and beautiful girls were picked out
	for the army of conquest and the Holy City of Jerusalem and the
	Temple were pulled down to the ground. After this the Jewish
	influence so disappeared from Palestine that the Jews could not
	regain power for two thousand years, and the Holy Temple could never
	be rebuilt.. Afterwards the Roman Emperor, Hadrian, restored
	Jerusalem but renamed it Aelia. The Jews, however, were not allowed
	to enter it for centuries. This was the calamity that the Jews
	suffered on account of their degeneration for the second time.</P>

	means that, everyone is solely responsible for one's moral conduct
	and is accountable to God as an individual in one's own person and
	no other person can share the burden of responsibility with him. As
	an instance, we they take the case of a particular action or a
	particular way of conduct in which a generation or a community or a
	large number of people had collaborated. When the people will
	assemble before Allah on the Day of Judgment their collective action
	will be analyzed so as to lay the burden of its responsibility on

	punished in accordance with it. Neither will a person be punished
	for. the part another had played in its performance nor shall the
	burden of the sin of one individual laid on the shoulders of
	another. This doctrine has been emphasized over and over again so
	that a wise man should not act in imitation of another or justify
	Iris own conduct by similar deeds of others. If a particular person

	a definite form of Divine procedure for the destruction of a people
	has been stated. When the well-to-do people of a habitation become
	disobedient, it is a portent that it is doomed to destruction. After
	their persistent and continuous transgression, the well-to-do people
	become so obdurate in their disobedience that they begin to discard
	the instinctive dictates of their conscience. The same thing has
	been stated in v. 16: &quot;When We decree that a habitation should
	be destroyed We give Commands to its well-to-do people and they show
	disobedience.&quot; This is because Allah has created conscience for
	the guidance of man. Therefore, the dictates of conscience are
	really the commands of Allah. Thus it has become quite obvious that
	by &quot;When We decree that a habitation should be destroyed&quot;
	is not meant that Allah intends to destroy it without any reason. It
	is destroyed because after their disobedience &quot;that habitation
	incurs Our just wrath and We totally exterminate it.&quot; The
	habitation deserves such a punishment because its common people
	follow the well-to-do people who are the factual leaders of a
	community and are mainly responsible for the corruption of the
	community. At first the well-to-do people commit acts of
	disobedience, wickedness, mischief, cruelty and tyranny and then the
	common people follow them and incur the torment of Allah.
	Incidentally, this is a warning for every community that it should
	be very discreet and prudent in choosing and electing its leaders
	and rulers, for if the latter are mean and wicked, they will
	inevitably lead the community to destruction.</P>

	refers to the Divine law according to which those people, who do not
	believe in the Hereafter, cannot benefit from the Qur'an. Allah has
	attributed this law to Himself, as if to say, &quot;The natural
	result of disbelief in the Hereafter is that the heart of such a man
	becomes dull and his ears become deaf to the Message of the Qur'an,
	for Qur'an bases its invitation on the belief in the Hereafter. So
	it warns the people that they should not be deluded by this apparent
	aspect of the worldly life if there appears to be none to call them
	to account here; for it does not mean they are not at all
	accountable and answerable to anyone. Likewise if Allah allows
	freedom of belief to practice shirk, atheism, disbelief or Tauhid
	with impunity in this world, and their practice does not appear to
	make any practical difference in this world, it does not mean that
	these things do not produce any results at all. For, in fact,
	everyone shall be accountable and answerable but after death in the
	Next World. Then every one will realize that the doctrine of Tauhid
	alone is true and all other doctrines are false. For, if at present
	the consequences of deeds do not appear after death they shall
	inevitably appear, but now the Reality has been hidden behind an
	invisible curtain. There is an inevitable moral law according to
	which submission to it will bear its fruit and disobedience shall
	incur its losses. As decisions according to this moral law will be
	made in the Hereafter, you should not be enticed by the charms of
	this transitory life. You should, therefore, keep in view that
	ultimately you shall have to render an account of all your deeds in
	this world before your Lord, and adopt that true creed and moral
	attitude which may be conducive to your success in the Hereafter.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From this

	feel and experience. Naturally his ears will not listen to the
	Message and it will never reach the depths of his heart. Allah has
	stated this psychological fact in this verse.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this

	over our hearts, and our ears are deaf for the Message you give and
	there is a curtain between you and us. You may go on with your work
	and we will do whatever we desire.&quot; Here the same words have

	recital of the Qur'an at dawn is witnessed by the angels of Allah to
	testify it, as has been explained in the Traditions. Though the
	angels witness each prayer and each good deed the special mention of
	their being witnesses at the time of the recital of the Qur'an
	during the Morning Prayer gives it a particular Importance. That is
	why the Holy Prophet used to recite long passages from the Qur'an
	during the Morning Prayer. His example was followed by the
	Companions, and the succeeding Muslim scholars held it to be a
	desirable thing. <BR>In this verse, it has been briefly stated how
	to establish Salat which was made obligatory on the occasion of Mi
	`raj at the prescribed timings. It has been ordained that the first
	Prayer is to be offered before the sunrise and the remaining four
	after the declining of the sun till the darkness of the night.
	Afterwards Angel Jibril was sent to the Holy Prophet to define the
	limits of the timings of each Prayer. According to a Tradition of
	Abu Da'ud and Tirmizi related by Ibn 'Abbas, the Holy Prophet said,
	&quot;Jibril led me in the five Prayers twice near the Ka`abah. On
	the first day, he offered the Dhuhr Prayer just after the declining
	of the sun, when the shadow of everything was the shortest. Then he
	offered the 'Asr Prayer when the shadow of each thing was equal to
	its own length; then the Maghrib Prayer at the time when one breaks
	one's fast, and the 'Isha' Prayer was offered just at the time when
	twilight had disappeared, and Faj rPrayer at the time when it
	becomes unlawful to eat and drink anything for the one who intends
	to observe a Fast. The next day he offered the Dhuhr Prayer at the
	time when the shadow of each thing became equal to its own length
	and the 'Asr Prayer when the shadow had doubled. The Maghrib Prayer
	was offered as on the previous day and the Isha' Prayer when
	one-third of the night had passed away, and the Morning Prayer when
	light had spread all over. After this Jibril turned towards me and
	said. 'O Muhammad, these are the timings of Salat of the Prophets
	and the right tunings are between these two extreme limits.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Qur'an has also pointed to these five times of Salat on different
	occasions:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) &quot;And
	listen; establish Salat at the two ends of the day and in the early
	parts of the night...&quot; (IX: 114).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	&quot;...And glorify your Lord with His praise before the sunrise
	(Fajr) and before sunset ('Asr) and then glorify Him during the
	night (`Isha') and then at the ends of the day (Fajr, Dhuhr and
	Maghrib)...&quot; (XX: 130).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) &quot;So
	glorify Allah when it is evening for you (Maghrib), and when it is
	morning (Fajr). praise is only for Him in the heavens and the earth
	and glorify him in the later part of the afternoon ( 'Asr) and in
	the afternoon (Dhuhr). &quot;(XXX. 17-18).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is
	great wisdom in this system of the timings of Salat. One of these is
	to avoid the timings of the worship of the sun-worshipers. This is
	because the sun has always been in every age one of the greatest
	deities of the mushriks, who worshiped it especially at the time of
	sunrise and sunset. Therefore, these two times have totally been
	forbidden for Salat. Besides this, they worshiped the sun at the
	time of its zenith. That is why Islam has ordained that the Muslims
	should offer their two Prayers during the day-time after the sun has
	declined and the Fajr Prayer before the sunrise. The Holy Prophet
	himself has stated this wisdom of the timings of Prayer in several
	Traditions. For instance, in the Tradition related by 'Amar bin
	`Abasah, the Holy Prophet is reported to have replied to a qua&quot;soon
	to this effect: &quot;Offer your Morning Prayer, but refrain from it
	when the sun is about to rise until it has risen high. For the sun
	rises between the horns of Satan and the unbelievers fall prostrate
	before it at that time.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then
	after mentioning the `Asr Prayer, he said:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;After
	`Asr Prayer, refrain from any Prayer until the sunset, for during
	that time the sun sets between the horns of Satan and the
	unbelievers fall prostrate before it.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	rising and the setting of the sun between the horns of Satan is a
	symbolic expression that has been used in this Tradition. This
	implies that both these times are used by Satan as temptations for
	the people. This is, as if to say, that Satan is so pleased with the
	worship of the unbelievers at the time of sunrise and sunset that he
	appears to carry the sun on his head as a mark of approval. This
	interpretation of the Tradition is based on this remark of the Holy
	Prophet: &quot;The unbelievers fall prostrate before it.&quot;</P>

	that the truth would ever overpower falsehood. That is why the
	disbelievers took it for a boastful talk and scoffed at it when this
	declaration was trade. But this prophecy of victory did come out
	true in less than a decade when the Holy Prophet entered the same
	city of Makkah as a conqueror, and entered the Ka'abah where he made
	the same declaration while he was breaking the three hundred and
	sixty idols. According to a Tradition of Bukhari, related by Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin Mas`ud, &quot;On the day of the conquest of Makkah the
	Holy Prophet went on striking idols and uttering these words: &ldquo;The
	Truth has come and falsehood has vanished; for falsehood is a thing
	that must by its nature vanish. The Truth has come and falsehood
	will never reappear nor return.&rdquo;</P>

	the Qur'an does not allow them to remain even in that bad condition
	in which they were before its revelation or its knowledge but
	involves them in a greater loss than before. This is because before
	the revelation of the Qur'an or their acquaintance with it, they
	suffered from ignorance alone but when the Qur'an came before them
	and made distinct the difference between Truth and falsehood, no
	excuse was left with them to remain in their previous condition of.
	ignorance. After this, if they reject its guidance and persist in
	their deviation, it is a clear proof that they are not ignorant but
	workers of iniquity and worshipers of falsehood, which arc averse to
	the Truth. For then their position is of the one who, when presented

	that it came by the Command of Allah. But we have great hesitation

	mushriks, &quot;Where from do you bring the Qur'an?&quot; as if to
	say, &quot;O Muhammad, these people ask you about &quot;The Spirit',
	that is, the source of the Qur'an or the means of acquiring it&quot;,
	so tell them, &quot;This Spirit comes to me by the Command of my

	challenge occurs at several other places in the Qur'an: (II: 23, X:
	38-39, XL: 13-14, LII: 33-34). At all these places, this has been
	cited as an answer to the charge of the disbelievers that Muhammad

	presenting it as Allah's Word. Besides this, the same has also been

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us turn to the three arguments contained in these verses as a proof
	that the Qur'an is the Word of Allah.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	Qur'an is such a miracle in regard to its language, style,
	arguments, themes, topics, teachings and prophecies that it is
	beyond any human power to produce the like of it, as if to say, &quot;You
	say that a man has invented this but We challenge that even the
	whole of mankind combined cannot produce a Book like this: nay, even
	if the jinns, whom the mushriks worship as deities and whom this
	Book openly attacks, should come to the help of the disbelievers,
	they cannot produce a Book like this to refute this challenge.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) As
	regards the charge that Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) has
	himself invented this Book, the Qur'an refutes their claim, as if to
	say, &quot;Muhammad is one of you and not a foreigner. He has lived
	among you for forty years before the revelation of the Qur'an. Did
	you ever hear words like those of the Qur'an from him even a day
	before his claim of Prophethood, or did you ever hear him discussing
	themes and problems contained in the Qur'an? If you consider the
	matter from this point of view, it will become obvious to you that
	the sudden change which has come about in the language, ideas,
	information, style and the way of thinking of Muhammad, could not
	take place without Divine Guidance.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) &quot;Can
	you not see that after the recital of the Qur'an he does not
	disappear but lives among you? You hear other things than the Qur'an
	from him. Do you not notice that the distinction between the two
	different styles of expression is so obvious that no man can
	successfully adopt the two styles at one and the same time?&quot;
	The distinction can also be noticed, even today, between the
	language of the Qur'an and that of the Traditions of the Holy
	Prophet. Anyone well-versed in the Arabic language and literature
	notices the difference which is so marked that one can categorically
	say that these modes of expression cannot belong to one and the same
	person. (For further reference please also see E.N. 21 of X 16).

	is the second answer to the demand of the disbelievers for a
	miracle. The first answer is contained in V. 59. The eloquence of
	this concise answer is above praise: &quot;You demand from me that I
	should cause a spring to gush forth, or in the twinkling of an eye
	should bring into being a garden in full bloom with canals flowing
	in it: or I should cause the heaven to fall into pieces on those of
	you who are rejecting the message: or I should cause to build a
	furnished palace of gold: or I should call Allah and the angels to
	stand before you and testify to this effect: ' We Ourselves have
	sent down Muhammad as Our Messenger' : or I should go up to the sky
	in your presence and bring down, addressed to you, the letter of
	authority of my appointment duly signed by Allah so that you may
	touch it with your hands and read it with your own eyes. &quot; The
	concise answer to these big demands was this, &quot;My Lord be
	glorified! Have I ever claimed to be anything more than a human
	Messenger?&quot; It may be expanded like this: &quot;O foolish
	people! have 1 claimed to be God that you are demanding such things
	from me? Did I ever say that I am all-powerful and am ruling over
	the Earth and the Heavens? From the very first day my claim has been
	that I am a human being who is bringing the Message from God.
	Therefore, if you want to judge the authenticity of my claim, you
	may judge it from my Message. If you are convinced that it is based
	on the Truth and is absolutely rational, then you should believe in
	it without making foolish demands. On the other hand, if you find
	any defect in it, you may reject it. If you want to test whether my
	claim is based on truth, you should judge it by the standard of my
	conduct and morals as a human being and my mission. Is it not a
	folly that, instead of this, you are demanding from me to cleave the
	earth and cause the sky to fall? Is there any connection whatsoever
	of Prophethood with things like that?&quot;</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote107sym" HREF="#sdfootnote107anc">107</A>It
	implies that this misunderstanding has always been common among the
	ignorant people of every age that a human being could not be a
	Messenger of Allah: They rejected a Messenger just because he was a
	human being and took his meals and had wife and children like
	themselves. In contrast to this, after the passage of the time the
	credulous followers of a Messenger began to claim that he was not a
	human being at all because he was a Messenger. That is why some
	people made their Messenger their God, others the son of God and
	still others the incarnation of God. In short, the ignorant people
	had never been able to understand that a human being could be a
	Messenger of Allah.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote108sym" HREF="#sdfootnote108anc">108</A>This
	is to say that Messenger does not merely convey the Message but is
	sent to reform human life in accordance with it. He has to apply the
	principles of the Message to the circumstances of human beings and
	has himself to demonstrate practically those principles. Moreover,
	he has to remove the misunderstandings of those people who try to
	listen w and understand his Message. Besides this, he has to
	organize and train the Believers to create a society based on the
	teachings of his Message. He has to struggle against those who
	reject and oppose his Message in order to subdue those powers that
	are bent upon corruption, and bring about that reformation for which
	Allah has sent His Messenger. As all these things have to be done in
	a society of human beings only a human Messenger can perform the
	mission. If an angel had been sent as a Messenger, the most he could
	have done was to convey the message, for he could not live among
	human beings and share their life and problems in order to reform
	them. It is thus clear that a human Messenger only could be suitable
	for this purpose.</P>

	has been particularly mentioned here because the mushriks of Makkah
	attributed the same epithet to the Holy Prophet as contained in V.
	47. &quot;These wrong-doers say to each other, 'The man, you are
	following, is a bewitched person' . &quot;Here they are being warned
	that in this they were following Pharaoh, who gave the same epithet
	to Prophet Moses.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, we want to make a brief reference to an objection which
	has been raised by the modernists against a Tradition according to
	which the Holy Prophet once came under the influence of sorcery.
	They say that this Tradition confirms that the epithet &quot;bewitched&quot;
	applied to the Holy Prophet by the Quraish was correct, whereas the
	Qur'an refutes this as false: They forget that the same argument
	could be applied to the case of Prophet Moses whom Pharaoh accused
	of being bewitched, for the Qur'an says, in XX: 66-67: &quot;When
	the magicians threw down their cords and rods (instruments of their
	sorcery), it seemed to Moses as if they were running, as a result of
	which Moses conceived in his mind a sort of fear. &quot; If the
	words of the Tradition were to be considered against the Qur'an, do
	not these words of the Qur'an contradict its own words that the
	charge of Moses being bewitched was false? Do these modernists
	consider this verse to confirm Pharaoh's charge?&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As a
	matter of fact, these objectors do not know the sense in which the
	disbelievers of Makkah and Pharaoh called the Holy Prophet and
	Prophet Moses (Allah's peace be upon them) bewitched. What they
	meant was that some enemy had so bewitched them that they had lost
	their senses and so in their insanity claimed to be prophets and
	delivered a curious message. The Qur'an refutes this charge as
	false. As regards the temporary influence of magic on same person or
	a part of him has not been denied, for the influence of magic is
	like the effect produced on a person who is hit with a stone. The
	fact that some prophet was temporarily influenced by magic, does not
	in any way affect his prophethood adversely. Just as poison produced
	its effect on a prophet, or a prophet was wounded, so a prophet
	could also temporarily come under the influence of magic. Such a
	temporary magic could not cause any defect in his prophethood. God
	forbid, had magic produced any adverse effect on his reasoning and
	thinking faculties, one might have been skeptical about the
	authenticity of the Message. And when Pharaoh and the disbelievers
	of Makkah said that Prophet Moses and the Holy Prophet were
	bewitched, they meant that they had lost their senses under the
	influence of magic. The Qur'an refutes this charge brought against
	the Prophets.</P>
