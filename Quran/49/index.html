they have been given the instruction that it is not right to believe
in every news blindly and to act according to it, without due
thought. If information is received about a person, a group or a
community, it should be seen carefully whether the means of the
information is reliable or not. If the means is not reliable, it
should be tested and examined to see whether the news is authentic or
not before taking any action on it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
the Muslims have been exhorted to safeguard against the evils that
corrupt collective life and spoil mutual relationships. Mocking and
taunting each other, calling others by nicknames, creating
suspicions, prying into other people's affairs and back biting are
the evils which are not only sins in themselves but they also corrupt
society. Allah has mentioned all these evils separately and forbidden
them as unlawful. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this, the national and racial distinctions that cause universal
corruption in the world have been condemned. Nations and tribes and
families pride of Ancestry and their looking down upon others as
inferior to themselves and their pulling down others only for the
sake of establishing their own superiority is an important factor
that has filled the world with injustices and tyranny. Allah in a
brief verse has cut at the root of this evil by stating that all men
are descendants of the same one pair and their division into tribes
and communities is only for the sake of recognition, not for boasting
and pride, and there is no lawful basis of one man's superiority over
the other except on the basis of moral excellence. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, the people have been told that the real thing is not the
verbal Profession of the Faith but to believe in Allah and His
messenger truly, to obey them in practical life and to exert
sincerely with one's self and wealth in the cause of Allah. True
believers are only those who adopt this attitude. As for those who
profess Islam merely orally without affirmation by the heart and then
adopt an attitude as if they had done someone a favor by accepting
Islam, may be counted among the Muslims in the world, may even be
treated as Muslims in society, but they cannot be counted as
believers in the sight of Allah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	them. &quot; This Command is, in its application and effect, a step
	further to verse 36 of AI-Ahzab. There it was said: `It does not
	behoove a believing man and a believing woman that when Allah and
	His Messenger have given their decision in a matter, they should
	exercise an Option in that matter of theirs&quot;, and here it is
	said that the believers should not decide their matters themselves
	by their own initiative, but should look for guidance in Allah's
	Book and His Prophet's Sunnah concerning those matters.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	Command it not confined only to individual matters of the Muslims
	but it also applies to their collective affairs. This is in fact the
	fundamental article of the Islamic Law, which can neither be set
	aside or ignored by a Muslim government, nor by a Muslim court, nor
	by a parliament. A tradition has been reported in Musnad~Ahmad, Abu
	Da'ud, Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, with authentic chains of
	transmitters, saying that when the Holy Prophet was sending Hadrat
	Mu'adh bin Jabal to the Yaman as a judge, he asked him: &quot;By
	what will you decide the matters?&quot; He submitted: &quot;By the
	Book of Allah. &quot; The Holy Prophet said: &quot;If you do not
	find the Command concerning a matter in the Book of Allah, what will
	you turn to?&quot; He replied &quot;To the Sunnah of Allah's
	Messenger. &quot; The Holy Prophet asked &quot;If this also fails
	you?&quot; He replied: &quot;Then I shall exert and find out a
	solution by myself. &quot; Thereupon the Holy Prophet placed his
	hand on Hadrat Mu'adh's chest and said: &quot;Thank God Who has
	helped His Messenger's deputy to adopt the way that is approved by
	His Messenger. &quot; This giving of precedence to the Book of Allah
	and the Sunnah of His Messenger over one's own exercise to find out
	a solution and to turn to them first to obtain guidance is the

	that marks the distinction between a Muslim judge and a non-Muslim

	the consensus of the entire Ummah cannot go against or remain

	training in Islamic etiquette and manners under the Holy Prophet
	himself had a full regard for his person. They fully realized how
	busy he remained in performing the mission entrusted to him by
	Allah; they also understood full well that during those tiresome
	activities he must necessarily have some time for rest, time for his
	important occupations and also time for attending to his domestic
	affairs. Therefore, they would come to visit him only at the time
	when he was available outside his house, and if ever they did not
	find him outside his living quarters among his Companions, they
	would sit and await his emergence and would avoid giving him the
	trouble of coming out of his house unless there was a special need
	for it. But many a time it so happened that the people from far
	flung areas, who had had no opportunity to receive training in good
	manners, would come to visit the Holy Prophet with the idea that the
	one who invited others to Allah and was working for the reformation
	of the people had no right to have rest at any time, and they had
	the right to visit and see him any time they pleased in the day or

	their arrival through some attendant, but would start shouting from
	outside the apartments of his wives to call him out. Several such
	incidents have been reported by the Companions in the Hadith. This
	sort of behavior troubled him much, but he was tolerant on account
	of his natural clemency. At last, Allah had to intervene, Who
	reproved the people for their uncivilized behavior and gave this

	of the commentators have expressed the view that this verse was sent
	down concerning Walid bin 'Uqbah bin Abi Mu'ait. Its background is
	this: When the tribe of the Bani al-Mustaliq embraced Islam, the
	Holy Prophet sent Walid bin `Uqbah to collect the zakat from them.
	When he arrived in their territory, he became scared due to some
	reason and without visiting the people of the tribe returned to
	Madinah and complained to the Holy Prophet that they had refused to
	pay the zakat and had even wanted to kill him. On hearing this the
	Holy Prophet became very angry and he made up his mind to dispatch a
	contingent to punish those people. According to some traditions he
	had dispatched the contingent, and according to others, he was about
	to dispatch it. In any case all agree that in the meantime the chief
	of the Bani al-Mustaliq, Harith bin Dirar (father of Juwairiyah,
	wife of the Holy Prophet), arrived at the head of a deputation, and
	submitted: &quot;By God, we did not at all see Walid; therefore,
	there could be no question of refusing to pay the zakat and wanting
	to kill him. We arc steadfast to the Faith and have no intention to
	withhold the zakat. &quot; At this, this verse was sent down. With a
	little variation in wording this incident has been related by Imam
	Ahmad, Abi Hatim, Tabarani, and Ibn Jarir, on the authority of
	Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas, Harith bin Dirar, Mujahid, Qatadah,
	'Abdur Rehman bin Abi Laila, Yazid bin Ruman, Dahhak and Muqatil bin
	Hayyan. In the tradition reported by Hadrat Umm Salamah this whole
	story has been related likewise but there is no reference to the
	name of Walid. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On this
	critical occasion when on account of believing in a baseless report
	a grave blunder was about to be committed, Allah gave the Muslims
	this guiding principle to be followed on receipt of news: 'Whenever
	you receive important news bearing upon a vital matter, you should
	not accept it immediately but should first examine the man who has
	brought it. If he is an evil man whose report they not be authentic
	normally, you should inquire into it carefully to ascertain the
	truth instead of accepting it and acting on it immediately.&quot;
	From this Divine Command An important legal principle is deduced,
	the sphere of application of which is very vast. According to it, it
	is not permissible for a Muslim government to take any action
	against a person or a group or a nation on the basis of the reports
	provided by the secret agents whose character might be doubtful. On
	the basis of this very principle the traditionists introduced the
	art of critical appraisal in the science of Hadith in order to
	determine the value and worth of the people through whom traditions
	of the Holy Prophet reached the later generations, and the jurists
	established this principle in the law of evidence that in a matter
	from which a Shari'ah value can be deduced, or a duty imposed on a
	person; the evidence of an evil man would be unacceptable. However,
	all scholars agree that as far as the common worldly matters are
	concerned it is not necessary to ascertain the truth of every news
	and the reliability of every informer. For the word used in the
	verse is naba'. which does not apply to every news but only to the
	news of consequence. That is why the jurists say that this principle
	does not apply in the case of ordinary matters. For example, if a
	person goes to visit somebody and seeks permission to enter the
	house, and a person comes out and conveys the permission, he can
	enter the house accordingly no matter whether the one conveying the
	permission from the master of the house was good or bad. Likewise,
	the scholars are also agreed that the evidence, as well as the
	report, of the people whose evil does not relate to lying and
	immorality, but they are regarded as unrighteous only on account of
	false beliefs, will also be acceptable. Only the falsehood of heir
	creed cannot be a hindrance to accepting their evidence or reports.&nbsp;

	insisted that they should be attacked at once. At this those people
	were warned that they should not forget that the Holy Prophet was

	Allah by His bounty and grace had endeared to them the path of the
	Faith and made unbelief, wrongdoing and disobedience abhorrent to
	them. The addressees in the two parts of this verse are two separate

	the parties may be two powerful groups, or two Muslim governments,
	and both may be fighting for the sake of the world: In this case,

	one of the belligerent parties as mentioned under (b) above may be
	in the right and the other the aggressor, who may not be listening
	to counsel nor be inclined to make peace: In this case believers
	should side with and support the party that is in the right against
	the aggressor.

	guilty of rebelling.

	the Divine Law, and they might appear to be righteous. In this case,
	acute difference of opinion has appeared among the jurists as to
	whether they should be declared the &quot;rebels&quot;(i.e.
	transgressors) and whether it is obligatory to fight them or not.
	This we state below briefly: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	generality of the jurists and the Ahl al-Hadith hold the view that
	it is unlawful to rise in revolt against a ruler whose government
	has once been established and there is complete peace and order in
	the land under him, no matter whether he is just or unjust, and he
	has come to power in any way whatever, except in case he commits
	disbelief openly. Imam Sarakhsi writes: &quot;In a case when the
	Muslims are agreed on a ruler and they enjoy peace under him and the
	roads are safe, if a group of the Muslims rises in revolt against
	him, everyone who has power is under obligation to side with the
	ruler of the Muslims and wage war against the rebels.&quot;
	(Al-Mabsut, Bab al-Khwarij) Imam Nawawi writes in his commentary of
	Sahih Muslim:&quot;It is forbidden to rise in revolt and fight
	against the Imams (i.e. the Muslim rulers) even if they are wicked
	and unjust.&quot; Imam Nawawi claims that there is consensus on
	this. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But this
	claim of the consensus is not correct. A large group of the jurists
	of Islam which includes some major scholars, declares those rising
	in revolt as &quot;rebels only in case they rise in revolt against a
	just ruler. They do not regard as rebellion&quot; in the Qur'anic
	terminology the rising in revolt of the righteous against the unjust
	and wicked rulers, nor declare the waging of war against them as
	obligatory. The view of Imam Abu Hanifah about fighting against
	unjust rulers is. well known among the scholars. Abu Bakr al Jassas
	clearly writes in his Ahkam al-Qur an that the Imam regarded this
	fighting not only as permissible but as obligatory in favorable
	conditions. (Vol. I, p. 81; Vol. II, p. 39). In Zaid bin 'Ali's
	revolt against the Umayyads he not only provided financial help but
	urged others also to do the same. (AI-Jassas, Vol I, p. 81). In Nafs
	al-Zakiyah's rcvolt against Mansur he went on earnestly supporting
	Nafs al-Zakiyah, and he declared this war as superior to a war
	against the disbelievers. (AI-jassas, Vol. I, p. 81; AI-Kardari,
	Manaqib Abi Hanifah, Vol. II, pp. 71-72). Then the view as stated by
	Imam Sarakhsi is the just ruler.&quot; Ibn 'Aqil and Ibn al-Jawzi
	from among the Hanbalis not unanimous even among the Hanafi jurists.
	Ibn Humam writes in Fath al-Qadir (commentary of Hedaya): &quot;In
	the parlance of the jurists the rebel is he who gives up obedience
	of regard rising in revolt against an unjust ruler as lawful and
	present Hadrat Husain's revolt as an argument. (Al-Infaf, Vol. -X,
	Bab Qital Ahl al-Baghyi). Imam Shafe`i in his Kitab al-Um regards as
	rebel the one who fights against a just ruler (Vol. IV, p. 135).
	Imam Malik's view as cited in Al-Mudawwanah is: &quot;If the rebels
	come out to fight against a just ruler, they should be forcibly
	opposed.&quot; (Vol. I, p. 407). Qadi Abu Bakr Ibn al-`Arabi has
	cited his this view in Ahkam al-Qur 'an: &quot;When a person rises
	in revolt against a just ruler like 'Umar bin Abdul 'Aziz, it is
	obligatory to resist and repel him; as for some other kind of the
	ruler, he should be left alone. Allah will punish him through some
	other unjust person and then both of them through some third unjust
	person.&quot; Another saying of Imam Malik that has been cited is:
	&quot;When the pledge has been sworn to a ruler, and then his
	brothers rise in revolt against him, they will be fought against, if
	he is a just ruler. As for the rulers of our tune, there is no
	pledge for them, for pledge to them has been taken by coercion. &quot;
	Then the view of the Maliki scholars that the Qadi has cited with
	reference to Sahnun is: 'Fighting will be undertaken only under the
	just ruler, whether the just ruler is the former one or the one who
	has risen in revolt against him later, but if neither is just, one
	should keep away from both. However, if one's own self is attacked,
	or the Muslims are being subjected to tyranny, one should put up
	resistance.&quot; After citing these different views, Qadi Abu Bakr
	says: &quot;We will not fight except on the side of the just ruler,
	whom the truth-loving people have made their head of their own free
	will. &quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) If
	the ones rising in revolt are small in number, and may have no large
	party on their back, nor be possessing any substantial war
	equipment, the law of rebellion will not be applied against them,
	but they will be proceeded against under the common penal law, i.e.
	if they kill, they will be subjected to the law of retaliation, and
	if they damage property, they will be required to pay the penalties.
	The law of sedition is applied only against those rebels who might
	be powerful, and rise in revolt in large numbers and with
	substantial military equipment.

	will be waged against them only when they actually rise in armed
	revolt and start shedding blood. (Al-Mabsut, Bab al-Khwarij; Fath
	al-Qadir, Bab al-Bighat, al-Jassas, Ahkam al-Qur an). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5)
	Before starting war against the rebels they will first be invited,
	according to the Qur'anic instructions, to give up the way of
	rebellion and adopt the way of justice; if they have some doubts and
	objections, effort will be made to remove them; even then if they do
	not listen, and fighting begins from their side, force will be used
	to deal with them. (Fath al-Qadir,' al Jassas, Ahkam al-Qur 'an). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) The
	code of regulations that has to be observed in the war against the
	rebels is based on the Holy Prophet's following Command that has
	been related by Hakim, Bazzar and al-Jassas on the authority of
	Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	Holy Prophet asked Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas`ud: O Ibn Umm 'Abd: Do
	you know what is Allah's Command concerning the rebels of this
	Ummah? He replied: Allah and His Messenger have the best knowledge.
	The Holy Prophet said: Their wounded ones will not be laid hands on
	and their captives will not be killed, and the one who flees, will
	not be pursued, and their properties will not be distributed as
	spoils.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second source of this code which has been held as trust-worthy by
	all the jurists is the word and deed of Hadrat 'AIi. After attaining
	victory in the Battle of the Camel, he announced; &quot;Do not
	pursue him who flees; do not attack the wounded; do not kill the
	captives; give shelter to him who surrenders; do not make forcible
	entry into the people's houses; and do not raise your hands at the
	women even if they are abusing and cursing you.&quot; Some of his
	soldiers made the demand that the opponents and their. family
	members be taken prisoners and distributed. At this he became
	furious and said: 'Who among you will take 'A'ishah, mother of the
	Faithful, as his share&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) The
	injunction concerning the properties of the rebels as derived from
	the good example of Hadrat 'AIi is that no part of it, whether it is
	found on the battlefield or behind them in their houses, and whether
	they are living or have been killed, will be declared as the spoils
	nor distributed among the army. However. no compensation will be
	necessary for the properties that have been damaged or destroyed. As
	soon as the war comes to an end and rebellion has been put down,
	their properties and belongings will be returned to them. Their
	weapons and conveyances, if seized during the war, will be used-
	against them, but will not be made the possession of the victors and
	distributed as the spoils; and if there is no more fear of a
	rebellion from them, their these things also will be returned to
	them. Only Imam Abu Yusuf has expressed the opinion that the
	government will declare them to be the spoils, (AI-Mabsut; Fath
	al-Qadir,' al-Jassas).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(9) To
	cut off the heads of the slain rebels and to take theta about the
	streets is a highly undesirable thing, for this is mutilation which
	the Holy Prophet has strictly forbidden. When the head of a Roman
	patriarch was brought before Hadrat Abu Bakr, he expressed great
	displeasure at it, and said: &quot;We are not here to imitate the
	Romans and Iranians.&quot; When it is not allowed to meet out such a
	treatment to the unbelievers, how much more so should it be with
	regard to the Muslims. (AI-Mabsut).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(10)
	Whatever damage might have been caused to life and property by the
	rebels during the war, no retaliation and recompense for it will be
	imposed on them after the war has come to an end and peace has been
	restored. Neither will there be any retaliation for a slain person
	nor any recompense for the lost property, so as to avoid any chance
	of the recurrence of the sedition. This same law was observed in the
	mutual fighting between the Companions. (Al-Mabsut: al.Jassas; Ibn
	al-'Arabi, Ahkam al-Qur 'an).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(11)
	After the government has recaptured the territories which had gone
	under the rebels and where they had established their rule and order
	and collected the zakat and other taxes, it will not demand the
	zakat and the taxes from the people once again. If the rebels have
	spent the money thus collected lawfully, the payers will be deemed
	to have paid them off lawfully in the sight of Allah as well. but if
	the rebels have spent the money unlawfully, it will be a matter
	between the payers and their God; if they so like they may pay their
	zakat dues once again. (Fat-h al-Qadir, al-Jassas; Ibn al-'Arabi).

	decisions according to the Shari'ah in the courts established by the
	rebels in the territories under them, will be up-held although the
	ones who appointed them might be guilty of sedition. However, if
	their decisions are against the Shari'ah. and they are brought
	before the courts of the government after the rebellion has been put
	down, they will not be enforced. Moreover, no warrant or summons
	issued by the courts established by the rebels will be acceptable in
	the courts of the government. (AI-Mabsut; al-Jassas). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(13) The
	evidence of the rebels will not be acceptable in the Islamic courts,
	for it is iniquitous to fight against the just. Imam Muhammad says:
	&quot;As long as they do not fight and actually rise in revolt
	against the people of justice, their evidence will be acceptable,
	but when they have already fought, I will not accept their evidence&quot;

	fourth kind of conjecture which is, in fact, a sin is that one
	should entertain a suspicion in respect of a person without any
	ground, or should start with suspicion in forming an opinion about
	others, or should entertain a suspicion about the people whose
	apparent conditions show that they are good and noble. Likewise,
	this also is a sin that when there is an equal chance of the evil
	and goodness in the word or deed of a person, one should regard it
	as only evil out of suspicion. For instance, if a gentleman while
	leaving a place of assembly picks up another one's shoes, instead of
	his own, and we form the opinion that he has done so with the
	intention of stealing the shoes, whereas this could be possible
	because of oversight as well, there is no reason for adopting the
	evil opinion instead of the good opinion except the suspicion. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	analysis makes it plain that conjecture by itself is not anything
	forbidden; rather in some cases and situations it is commendable, in
	some situations inevitable, in some permissible up to a certain
	extent and un-permissible beyond it, and in some cases absolutely
	unlawful. That is why it has not been enjoined that one should
	refrain from conjecture or suspicion altogether but what is enjoined
	is that one should refrain from much suspicion. Then, to make the
	intention of the Command explicit, it has been said that some
	conjectures are sinful. From this warning it follows automatically
	that whenever a person is forming an opinion on the basis of
	conjecture, or is about to take an action, he should examine the
	case and see whether the conjecture he is entertaining is not a sin,
	whether the conjecture is really necessary, whether there arc sound
	reasons for the conjecture, and whether the conduct one is adopting
	on the basis of the conjecture is permissible. Everyone who fears
	God will certainly take these precautions. To make one's conjecture
	free and independent of every such care and consideration is the
	pastime of only those people who are fearless of God and thoughtless
	of the accountability -of the Hereafter. &nbsp;

	not spy': Do not grope after the secrets of the people: do not

	conditions and affairs. Whether this is done because of suspicion,
	or for causing harm to somebody with an evil intention, or for
	satisfying one's own curiosity, it is forbidden by the Shari 'ah in
	every case. It does not behoove a believer that he should spy on the

	also includes reading other people's private letters, listening
	secretly to private conversation, peeping into the neighbor's house,
	and trying to get information in different ways about the domestic
	life or private affairs of others. This is grave immorality which
	causes serious mischief in society. That is why the Holy Prophet
	once said in an address about those who pry into other people's
	affairs: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;O
	people, who have professed belief verbally, but faith has not yet
	entered your hearts: Do not pry into the affairs of the Muslims, for

	his affairs, and he whom Allah follows inquisitively, is disgraced
	by Him in his own house. &quot; (Abu Da'ud). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Mu'awiyah says that he himself heard the Holy Prophet say; `If you

	Da'ud). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	prohibition of spying is not only applicable to the individuals but
	also to the Islamic government. The duty of forbidding the people to
	do evil that the Shari`ah has entrusted to the government does not
	require that it should establish a system of spying to inquire too
	curiously into the people's secret evils and then punish them, but
	it should use force only against those evils which are manifested
	openly. As for the hidden evils spying is not the way to reform them
	but it is education, preaching and counseling, collective training
	of the people and trying to create a pure social environment. In
	this connection, an incident concerning Hadrat `Umar is very
	instructive. Once at night he heard the voice of a person who was
	singing in his house. He became curious and climbed the wall. There
	he saw wine as well as a woman present. He shouted at the man,
	saying: &quot;O enemy of God, do you think you will disobey Allah,
	and Allah will not expose your secret?&quot; The man replied: &ldquo;Do
	not make haste, O Commander of the Faithful: if I have committed one
	sin, you have committed three sins: Allah has forbidden spying, and
	you have spied; Allah has commanded that one should enter the houses
	by the doors, and you have entered it by climbing over the wall;
	Allah has commanded that one should avoid entering the other
	people's houses without permission, and you have entered my house
	without my permission. &quot; Hearing this reply Hadrat `Umar
	confessed his error, and did not take any action against the man,
	but made him to promise that he would follow the right way in
	future. (Abi Bakr Muhammad bin Ja`far al-Khara'iti, Makarim
	al-Akhlaq). This shows that it is not only forbidden for the
	individuals but also for the Islamic government itself to pry into
	the secrets of the people and discover their sins and errors and
	then seize them for punishment. The same thing has been said in a
	Hadith in which the Holy Prophet has said: `When the ruler starts
	searching for the causes of suspicions among the people he corrupts
	them&quot; (Abu Da'ud). 
	</P>

	a person (or persons) some signs of corruption are visible and there
	is the apprehension that he is about to commit a crime, the
	government can inquire into his affairs; or, for instance, if
	somebody sends a proposal of marriage in the house of a person, or
	wants to enter into business with him, the other person can, inquire
	and investigate into his affairs for his own satisfaction. &nbsp;

	(back-biting) has been defined thus: &quot;It is saying on the back
	of a person something which would hurt him if he came to know of it.
	&quot; This definition has been reported from the Holy Prophet
	himself. According to a tradition which Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi,
	Nasa'i and others have related on the authority of Hadrat Abu
	Hurairah, the Holy Prophet defined ghibat as follows: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;It
	is talking of your brother in a way irksome to him.&quot; It was
	asked: &quot;What, if the defect being talked of is present in my
	brother ?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;If it is present in
	him, it would be ghibat; if it is not there, it would be slandering
	him. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In
	another tradition which Imam Malik has related in Mu'watta, on the
	authority of Hadrat Muttalib bin `Abdullah, &quot;A person asked the
	Holy Prophet: What is ghibat? The Holy Prophet replied: It is
	talking of your brother in a way irksome to him. He asked: Even if
	it is true, O Messenger of Allah? He replied: If what you said was
	false, it would then be a calumny.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These
	traditions make it plain that uttering a false accusation against a
	person in his absence is calumny and describing a real defect in him
	ghibat; whether this is done in express words or by reference and
	allusion, in every case it is forbidden. Likewise, whether this is
	done in the lifetime of a person, or after his death, it is
	forbidden in both cases. According to Abu Da'ud, when Ma`iz bin
	Malik Aslami had been stoned to death for committing adultery, the
	Holy Prophet on his way back heard a man saying to his companion:
	&quot;Look at this man: Allah had concealed his secret, but he did
	not leave himself alone till he was killed like a dog!&quot; A
	little further on the way there was the dead body of an ass lying
	rotting. The Holy Prophet stopped, called the two men and said:
	&quot;Come down and cat this dead ass.&quot; They submitted: &quot;Who
	will eat it, O Messenger of Allah?&quot; The Holy Prophet said: &quot;A
	little before this you were attacking the honor of your brother:
	that was much worse than eating this dead ass.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The only
	exceptions to this prohibition are the cases in which there may be a
	genuine need of speaking in of a person on his back, or after his
	death, and This may not be fulfilled without resort to backbiting,
	and if it was not resorted to, a greater evil might result than
	backbiting itself. The Holy Prophet has described this exception as
	a principle, thus: &quot;The worst excess is to attack the honour of
	a Muslim unjustly.&quot; (Abu Da'ud).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	saying the condition of `unjustly&quot; points out that doing so
	&quot;with justice&quot; is permissible. Then, in the practice of
	the Holy Prophet himself we find some precedents which show what is
	implied by &quot;justice&quot; and in what conditions and cases
	backbiting may be lawful to the extent as necessary.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Once a

	Holy Prophet, and as soon as the Prayer was concluded, walked away
	saying: &quot;O God, have mercy on me and on Muhammad, and make no
	one else a partner in this mercy beside the two of us.&quot; The
	Holy Prophet said to the Companions: `What do you say: who is more
	ignorant: this person or his camel? Didn't you hear what he said?&quot;
	(Abu Da`ud). The Holy Prophet had to say this in his absence, for he
	had left soon after the Prayer was over. Since he had uttered a
	wrong thing in the presence of the Holy Prophet, his remaining quiet
	at it could cause the misunderstanding that saying such a thing
	might in some degree be lawful; therefore, it was necessary that he
	should contradict it.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Two of
	the Companions, Hadrat Mu`awiyah and Hadrat Abu Jahm, sent the
	proposal of marriage to a lady, Fatimah bint Qais. She came to the
	Holy Prophet and asked for his advice. He said: &quot;Mu`awiyah is a
	poor man and Abu Jahm beats his wives much.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim).
	In this case, as there was the question of the lady's future and she
	had consulted the Holy Prophet for his advice, he deemed it
	necessary to inform her of the two men's weaknesses. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One day
	when the Holy Prophet was present in the apartment of Hadrat
	'A'ishah, a man came and sought permission to see him. The Holy
	Prophet remarked that he was a very bad man of his tribe. Then he
	went out and talked to him politely. When he came back into the
	house, Hadrat `A'ishah asked: &quot;You have talked to him politely,
	whereas when you went out you said something different about him. &quot;
	The Holy Prophet said, &quot;On the day of Resurrection the worst
	abode in the sight of Allah will be of the person whom the people
	start avoiding because of his abusive language.&quot; (Bukhari,
	Muslim). A study of this incident will show that the Holy Prophet in
	spite of having a bad opinion about the person talked to him
	politely because that was the demand of his morals; but he had the
	apprehension lest the people of his house should consider the person
	to be his friend when they would see him treating him kindly, and
	then the person might use this impression to his own advantage
	later. Therefore, the Holy Prophet warned Hadrat `A'ishah telling
	her that he was a had man of his tribe. Once Hind bint 'Utbah, wife
	of Hadrat Abu Sufyan, came to the Holy Prophet and said: &quot;Abu
	Sufyan is a miserly person: he does not provide enough for me and my
	children's needs. &quot; (Bukhari, Muslim). Although this complaint
	from the wife in the absence of the husband was backbiting, the Holy
	Prophet permitted it, for the oppressed one' has a right that he or
	she may take the complaint of injustice to a person who has the
	power to get it removed. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From
	these precedents of the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet, the jurists and
	traditionists have deduced this principle: 'Ghibat (backbiting) is
	permissible only in case it is needed for a real and genuine
	(genuine from the Shari'ah point of view) necessity and the
	necessity may not be satisfied without having resort to it&quot;.
	Then on the basis of the same principle the scholars have declared
	that ghibat is permissible in the following cases: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Complaining by an oppressed person against the oppressor before
	every such person who he thinks can do something to save him from
	the injustice. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) To
	make mention of the evils of a person (or persons) with the
	intention of reform before those who can do expected to help remove
	the evils. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) To

	seeking a religious or legal ruling regarding an unlawful act
	committed by a person.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) To
	warn the people of the mischiefs of a person (or persons) so that
	they may ward off the evil, e g. it is not only permissible but
	obligatory to mention the weaknesses of the reporters, witnesses and
	writers, for without it, it is not possible to safeguard the Shari
	ah against the propagation of false reports, the courts against
	injustices and the common people or the students against errors and
	misunderstandings. Or, for instance, if a person wants to have the
	relationship of marriage with somebody, or wishes to rent a house in
	the neighborhood of somebody, of wants to give something into the
	custody of somebody, and consults another person, it is obligatory
	for him to apprise him of all aspects so that he is not deceived
	because of ignorance.

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) To
	use nicknames for the people who may have become well known by those
	names, but this should be done for the purpose of their recognition
	and not with a view to condemn them. (For details, see Fat-h
	al-Bani, vol. X, p. 362; Sharh Muslim by An-Nawawi; Riyad
	us-Salihin; al-Jassas, Ahkam al-Qur an; Ruh al-Ma ani commentary on
	verse wa a yaghtab ba 'dukum ba 'dan). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Apart
	from these exceptions it is absolutely forbidden to speak ill of a
	person behind his back. If what is spoken is true, it is ghibat; if
	it is false, it is calumny; and if it is meant to make two persons
	quarrel, it is slander. The Shari 'ah has declared all these as
	forbidden. In the Islamic society it is incumbent on every Muslim to
	refute a false charge made against a person in his presence and not
	to listen to it quietly, and to tell those who are speaking ill of
	somebody, without a genuine religious need, to fear God and desist
	from the sin. The Holy Prophet has said: If a person does not
	support and help a Muslim when he is being disgraced and his honor
	being attacked, Allah also does not support and help him when he
	stands in need of His help; and if a person helps and supports a
	Muslim when his honor is being attacked and he is being disgraced,
	Allah Almighty also helps him when he wants that Allah should help
	him. (Abu Da'ud). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the backbiter, as soon as he realizes that he is committing this
	sin, or has committed it, his first duty is to offer repentance
	before Allah and restrain himself from this forbidden act. His
	second duty is that he should compensate for it as far as possible.
	If he has backbitten a dead person, he should ask Allah's
	forgiveness for the person as often as he can. If he has backbitten
	a living person, and what he said was also false, he should refute
	it before the people before whom he had made the calumny. And if
	what he said was true, he should never speak ill of him in future,
	and should ask pardon of the person whom he had backbitten. A
	section of the scholars has expressed the opinion that pardon should
	be asked only in case the other person has come to know of it;
	otherwise one should only offer repentance, for if the person
	concerned is unaware and the backbiter in order to ask pardon goes
	and tells him that he had backbitten him, he would certainly feel
	hurt.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote27">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote27sym" HREF="#sdfootnote27anc">27</A>In
	this sentence Allah by likening backbiting to eating the dead
	brother's flesh has given the idea of its being an abomination.
	Eating the dead flesh is by itself abhorrent; and when the flesh is
	not of an animal, but of a man, and that too of one's own dead
	brother, abomination would be added to abomination. Then, by
	presenting the simile in the interrogative tone it has been made all
	the more impressive, so that every person may ask his own conscience
	and decide whether he would like to eat the flesh of his dead
	brother. If he would not, and he abhors it by nature, how he would
	like that he should attack the honor of his brother-in-faith in his
	absence, when he cannot defend himself and when he is wholly unaware
	that he is being disgraced. This shows that the basic reason of
	forbidding backbiting is not that the person being backbitten is
	being hurt but speaking ill of a person in his absence is by itself
	unlawful and forbidden whether he is aware of it, or not, and
	whether he feels hurt by it or not. Obviously, eating the flesh of a
	dead man is not forbidden because it hurts the dead man; the dead
	person is wholly unaware that somebody is eating of his body, but
	because this act by itself is an abomination. Likewise, if the
	person who is ` backbitten also does not come to know of it through
	any means, he will retrain unaware throughout his life that somebody
	had attacked his honor at a particular time before some particular
	people and on that account he had stood disgraced in the eyes of
	those people. Because of this unawareness he will not feel at all
	hurt by this backbiting, but his honor would in any case be sullied.
	Therefore, this act in its nature is not any different from eating
	the flesh of a dead brother.

	the preceding verses the Muslims were addressed and given necessary
	instructions to safeguard the Muslim community against social&quot;evils.
	In this verse the whole of mankind bas been addressed to reform it
	of the great evil that has always been causing universal disruption
	in the world, that is, the prejudices due to race, color, language,
	country, and nationality. On account of these prejudices man in
	every age has generally been discarding humanity and drawing around
	himself some small circles and regarding those born within those
	circles as his own people and those outside them as others. These
	circles have been drawn on the basis of accidental birth and not on
	rational and moral grounds. In some cases their basis is the
	accident of being born in a particular family, tribe, or race, and
	in some particular geographical region, or in a nation having a
	particular color or speaking a particular language. Then the
	discrimination between one's own people and others is not only
	confide to this that those who are looked upon as one's own people
	are shown greater love and cooperation than others, but this
	discrimination has assumed the worst forms of hatred, enmity,
	contempt and tyranny. New philosophies have been propounded for it,
	new religions invented, new codes of law made and new moral
	principles framed; so much so that nations and empires have made
	this distinction a permanent way of life with them and practiced it
	for centuries. The Jews on this very basis regarded the children of
	Israel as the chosen people of God and even in the practice of their
	religious rites looked upon the non-Jews as inferior to the Jews in
	rights and rank. This very discrimination gave birth to class
	distinctions (varnashrama) among the Hindus according to which
	superiority of the Brahmins was established, all other human beings
	came to be regarded as inferior and unclean and the shudras cast
	into the depths of disgrace and degradation. Every person can see
	for himself even in this 20th century what atrocities have been
	committed against the colored people in Africa and America on
	account of the distinction between the white and the black. The
	treatment that the Europeans meted out to the Red Indian race in
	America and to the weak nations of Asia and Africa had the same
	concept underlying it. They thought that the lift and property and
	honor of all those who had been born outside the frontiers of their
	own land and nation were lawful for them and they had the right to
	plunder and take them as their slaves and exterminate them if need
	be. The worst examples of how the nationalism of the western nations
	has turned one nation against the others and made it their
	bloodthirsty enemy have been seen in the wars of the recent past and
	are being seen even in the present time. In particular, if what was
	manifested by the racism of the Nazi Germany and the concept of the
	superiority of the Nordic race m the last World War is kept in view.
	One can easily judge how stupendous and devastating is the error for
	whose reform this verse of the Qur'an was revealed. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	brief verse, Allah has drawn the attention of all mankind to three
	cardinal truths: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) &quot;The
	origin of all of you is one and the same: your whole species has
	sprung up from one man and one woman: all your races that arc found
	in the world today are, in fact, the branches of one initial race
	that started with one mother and one father. In this process of
	creation there is no basis whatever for the divisions and
	distinctions in which you have involved yourselves because_ of your
	false notions. One God alone is your Creator. Different men have not
	been created by different Gods. You have been made from one and the
	same substance; it is not so that some men have been made from some
	pure and superior substance and some other men from some impure and
	inferior substance. You have been created in one and the same way;
	it is not also so that different men have been created in different
	ways. And you are the offspring of the same parents; it is not so
	that in the beginning there were many human couples which gave birth
	to different populations in the different regions of the world.' 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) &quot;In
	spite of being one in origin it was natural that you should be
	divided into nations and tribes. Obviously,. all the men on the
	earth could not belong to one and the same family. With the spread
	of the race it was inevitable that countless families should arise,
	and then tribes and nations should emerge from the families.
	Similarly, it was inevitable that after settling in different
	regions of the earth, there should be differences of colors,
	features, languages and ways of living among the people, and it was
	also natural that those living in the same region should be closer
	in affinity and those living in remote regions not so close; but
	this natural difference never demanded that distinctions of
	inequality, of high and low, of noble and mean, should be
	established on its basis, that one race should claim superiority
	over the other, the people of one color should look down upon the
	people of other colors, and that one nation should take preference
	over the ocher without any reason. The Creator had divided the human
	communities into nations and tribes for that was a natural way of
	cooperation and distinction between them. In this way alone could a
	fatuity, a brotherhood, a tribe and a nation combine to give birth
	to a common way of life and to cooperate with each other in the
	affairs of the world. But it was all due to satanic ignorance that
	the differences among mankind created by Allah to be a means of
	recognition, were trade a means of mutual boasting and hatred, which
	led mankind to every kind of injustice and tyranny. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	only basis of superiority and excellence that there is, or can be,
	between man and man is that of moral excellence. As regards birth,
	all men arc equal, for their Creator is One, their substance of
	creation is one, and their way of creation is one, and they are
	descended from the same parents. Moreover, a person's being born in
	a particular country, nation, or clan is just accidental. Therefore,
	there is no rational ground on account of which one person may be
	regarded as superior to the other. The real thing that makes one
	person superior to others is that one should be more God-conscious,
	a greater avoider of evils, and a follower of the way of piety and
	righteousness. Such a man. whether he belongs to any race, any
	nation and any country, is valuable and worthy on account of his
	personal merit. And the one who is reverse of him in character is in
	any case an inferior person whether he is black or white, born in
	the east or the west.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These
	same truths that have been stated in this beef verse of the Qur'an,
	have been explained in greater detail by the Holy Prophet in his
	addresses and traditions. In the speech that he made on the conquest
	of Makkah, after going round the Ka'bah, he said: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">'Thank
	God Who has removed from you the blemish of ignorance and its
	arrogance. O people, men are divided into classes: the pious and
	righteous, who arc honorable in the sight of Allah, and the sinful
	and vicious, who arc contemptible in the sight of Allah, whereas all
	men are the children of Adam and Adam had been created by Allah from
	clay.&quot; (Baihaqi, Tirmidhi). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On the
	occasion of the Farewell Pilgrimage, in the midst of the Tashriq
	days, he addressed the people, and said: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">'O
	people, be aware: your God is One. No Arab has any superiority over
	a non-Arab, and no non-Arab any superiority over an Arab, and no
	white one has any superiority over a black one, and no black one any
	superiority over a white one, except on the basis of taqwa (piety).
	The most honorable among you in the sight, of Allah is he who is the
	most pious and righteous of you. Say if I have conveyed the Message
	to you?&quot; And the great congregation of the people responded,
	saying: Yes, you have, O Messenger of Allah.&quot; Thereupon the
	Holy Prophet said: &quot;Then let the one who is present convey it
	to those who are absent,&quot; ( Baihaqi) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In a
	Hadith he has said: &quot;You are all the children of Adam, and Adam
	was created from the dust. Let the people give up boasting of their
	ancestors, otherwise they will stand more degraded than a mean
	insect in the sight of Allah.&quot; ( Bazzar) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In
	another Hadith the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Allah will not inquire
	about your lineage on the Day of Resurrection. The most honorable in
	the sight of Allah is he who is most pious. &quot;(Ibn Jarir) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In still
	another Hadith he said: &quot;Allah dces not see your outward
	appearances and your possessions ,but He sees your hearts and your
	deeds.&quot; (Muslim, lbn Majah). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These
	teachings have not remained confined to words only but Islam has
	practically established a universal brotherhood of the believers on
	the basis, which does not allow any distinction on account of color,
	race, language, country and nationality which is free from every
	concept of high and low, clean and unclean, mean and respectable,
	which admits all human beings with equal rights, whether they belong
	to any race and nation, any land or region. Even the opponents of
	Islam have had to admit that no precedent is found in any religion
	and any system of the success with which the principle of human
	equality and unity has been given practical shape in the Muslim
	society, nor has it ever been found. Islam is the only religion
	which has welded and combined innumerable races and communities
	scattered in all corners of the earth into one universal Ummah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, a misunderstanding also needs to be removed. In the case
	of marriage, the importance that Islamic law gives to kufv (likeness
	of status) has been taken by some people in the sense that some
	brotherhoods are noble and some mean, and matrimonial relations
	between them are objectionable. But this, in fact, is a wrong idea.
	According to the Islamic law, every Muslim man can marry every
	Muslim woman, but the success of the matrimonial life depends on
	maximum harmony and conformity between the spouses as regards
	habits, characteristics and ways of life, family traditions and
	economic and social status, so that they may get on well with each
	other. This is the real object of being equal and alike. Where there
	is unusual difference and disparity between the man and the woman in
	this regard, lifelong companionship will be difficult. That is why
	the Islamic law disapproves of such intermarriages, and not for the
	reason that one of the spouses is noble and the other mean, but for
	the reason that in case there is a clear and apparent difference and
	distention in status, there would be a greater possibility of the
	failure of the matrimonial life if the marriage relationship was
	established.&nbsp;

	high rank and who is inferior in respect of qualities and
	characteristics. The standards of high and low that the people have
	set up of their own accord, are not acceptable to and approved by
	Allah. Maybe that the one who has been regarded as a man of high
	rank in the world is declared as the lowest of the low in the final
	judgment of Allah, and maybe that the one who has been looked upon
	as a very low person here, attains to a very high rank there. The

	the honor and dishonor that one will receive from Allah. Therefore,

<DIV ID="sdfootnote30">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote30sym" HREF="#sdfootnote30anc">30</A>This
	does not imply all the desert Arabs but only a few particular groups
	of the Bedouins who had become Muslims, seeing the increasing power
	of Islam, thinking that they would not only remain safe from any
	attack by the Muslims but would also gain materially from the
	Islamic conquests. These people had not embraced Islam sincerely but
	had professed faith only verbally in order to be counted among the
	Muslims, and their this inner state became exposed whenever they
	would come before the Holy Prophet with different sorts of demands
	and would enumerate and mention their rights as if they had done him
	a great favor by accepting Islam. Traditions mention several of such
	tribal groups, e.g. Muzainah, Juhainah, Aslam, Ashja', Ghifar, etc.
	About the Bani Asad bin Khuzaimah in particular, Ibn 'Abbas and Said
	bin Jubair have stated that once during a drought they came to
	Madinah and making a demand for financial help they said to the Holy
	Prophet again and again: &quot;We became Muslims without any
	conflict: we did not fight against you as have such and such other
	tribes fought.&quot; By this they clearly meant to point out that
	their refraining from fighting against the Messenger of Allah and
	their accepting Islam was a favour for which they must be rewarded
	by the Messenger and the Muslims. It was this same attitude and
	conduct of the Bedouin group living around Madinah, which has been
	commented upon in these verses. One can understand this appraisal
	better if one reads it together with vv. 90-110 of At-Taubah and vv.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote31sym" HREF="#sdfootnote31anc">31</A>Another
	translation of the words qulu aslamna can be; &quot;Say: we have
	become Muslims. &quot; From these words some people have concluded
	that in the language of the Qur'an, &quot;Mu 'min&quot; and &quot;Muslim&quot;
	are two opposite terms. A &quot;Mu'min&quot; is he who has believed
	sincerely and a &quot;Muslim&quot; he who might have accepted Islam
	only verbally without true faith. But, in fact, this is an
	absolutely wrong idea. No doubt the word iman here has been used for
	sincere affirmation by the heart and the word Islam for only outward
	and external submission but to understand them as two independent
	and mutually contradictory terms of the Qur'an is not correct. A
	study of the Qur'anic verses in which the words Islam and Muslim
	have been used, shows that in the Qur'anic terminology &quot;Islam &quot;
	is the name of the the Faith, which Allah has sent down for mankind;
	it comprehends the faith and obedience both, and a &brvbar;MuslIm &quot;
	is he who believes with a sincere heart and obeys the Commands
	practically. This is borne out by the following verses: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Indeed,
	Islam is the only right way of life in the sight of Allah.&quot; (Al

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;And

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And I
	have approved Islam as the way of life for you.&quot; (Al-Ma'idah:

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">`Whomever
	Allah wills to guide aright, He makes his breast wide open to
	Islam.&quot; (Al-An'am: 125) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Obviously,
	in these verses Islam &quot; does not imply obedience without the
	Faith. Here are some other verses: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">'Say (O
	Prophet): I have been enjoined to be the first one to affirm (faith

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, and
	at scores of other places, acceptance of Islam cannot mean adopting
	obedience without the the faith. Likewise, here are a few verses in
	which the word &quot;Muslim&quot; has occurred signifying the
	meaning in which it has been used repeatedly in the Qur'an: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;O
	you who have believed, fear Allah as He should truly be feared and
	see that you do not die save as true Muslim. &quot; (AI-`Imran: 102)
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">`Allah
	had called you &quot;Muslims&quot; before this and has called you
	(by the same name) in this Qur'an, too.&quot; (AI-Hajj: 78) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Abraham
	was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a Muslim, sound in the
	faith.&quot; (AI-i-'Imran: 67)

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">`And
	remember that when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the walls of

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After a
	study of these verses who can say that in these the word &quot;Muslim&quot;
	implies a person who does not believe sincerely but has accepted
	Islam only outwardly? Therefore, to make the claim that in the
	Qur'anic terminology &quot;Islam&quot; implies obedience without the
	faith and the &quot;Muslim&quot; in the language of the Qur'an is he
	who accepts Islam only outwardly is absolutely wrong. Likewise, this
	claim also is wrong that the words iman and mu'min have been used in
	the Qur'an necessarily in the sense of believing sincerely. No
	doubt, at most places these words have occurred to express the same
	meaning, but there are many places where these words have also been
	used for outward affirmation of the faith, and all those who might
	have entered the Muslim Community with verbal profession have been
	addressed with. &quot;O you who have believed&quot;, no matter
	whether they arc the true believers, or people with a weak faith, or
	mere hypocrites. For a few instances of this, see Al-i-`Imran: 156,
	An-Nisa' :13t5, AI-Ma'idah: 54, Al-Anfal: 20-27, At-Taubah: 38,
