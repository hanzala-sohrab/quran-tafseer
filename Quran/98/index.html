<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Its
having been placed after Surahs Al-Alaq and Al-Qadr in the
arrangement of the Quran is very meaningful. Surah Al-Alaq contains
the very first revelation, while Surah Al-Qadr shows as to when it
was revealed, and in this Surah it has been explained why it was
necessary to send a Messenger along with this Holy Book. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First
of all the need of sending a Messenger has been explained, saying:
The people of the world, be they from among the followers of the
earlier scriptures or from among the idolaters, could not possibly be
freed from their state of unbelief, until a Messenger was sent whose
appearance by itself should be a clear proof of his apostleship, and
he should present the Book of God before the people in its original,
pristine form, which should be free from every mixture of falsehood
corrupting the earlier Divine Books; and which should comprise sound
teachings. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
about the errors of the followers of the earlier Books it has been
said that the cause of their straying into different creeds was not
that Allah had not provided any guidance to them, but they strayed
only after a clear statement of the Right Creed had come to them.
From this it automatically follows that they themselves were
responsible for their error and deviation. Now, if even after the
coming of the clear statement through this Messenger, they continued
to stray, their responsibility would further increase. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">In
this very connection, it has been stated that the Prophets who came
from Allah and the, Books sent down by Him, did not enjoin anything
but that the way of sincere and true service to Allah be adopted,
apart from all other ways, no one else's worship, service or
obedience be mixed with His, the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">salat</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">be paid. This same has been the true
religion since ever. From this also it automatically follows that the
followers of the earlier scriptures, straying from this true
religion, have added extraneous things to it, which are false, and
Allah's this Messenger has come to invite them back to, the same
original faith. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, it has been pointed out clearly that the followers of the
earlier Books and the idolaters who would refuse to acknowledge this
Messenger are the worst of creatures: their punishment is an
everlasting Hell; and the people who would believe and act
righteously, and would spend life in the world in awe of God, are the
best of creatures: their reward is eternal Paradise wherein they will
live for ever. Allah became well pleased with them and they became
well pleased with Allah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>Here
	the word kufr (unbelief ) has been used in its widest sense, which
	includes different forms of the unbelieving attitude. For example,
	some were unbelievers in the sense that they did not acknowledge
	Allah at all: some did acknowledge Allah but did not regard Him as
	the One and only God, but worshiped others as well, thinking they
	were associates in Divine Being or Divine attributes and powers in
	one way or the other; some acknowledged oneness of God but committed
	some kind of shirk as well; some acknowledged God but did not
	acknowledge His Prophets and the guidance brought by them; some
	acknowledged one particular Prophet and did not acknowledge another;
	'others rejected the Hereafter. In short, there were different kinds
	of kufr in which the people were involved. And the statement: &quot;the
	disbelievers from among the people of the Book and the mushriks . .
	. &quot;,does not mean that some of them were not involved in kufr,
	but that those who were involved in kufr were of two kinds: the
	followers of the Book and the mushriks. Here, min has not been used
	for division but for explanation, as, . for example, in Surah
	Al-Hajj: 30, where it has been said Fajtanib-ur rijsa min al-authan.
	which means: &quot;therefore, guard yourselves against the filth of
	idols'-, and not: &quot;guard yourselves against the filth which is
	in the idols.&quot; Likewise, alladhina kafaru min ahl-il-Kitabi
	wal-mushrikin means: &quot;the, disbelievers from among the
	followers of the .Book and the mushriks ... &quot;, and not: &quot;those
	who have disbelieved from these two groups.&nbsp;

</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote2">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>Despite
	the common factor of kufr between them the two groups have been
	mentioned by separate names. The followers of the Book imply the
	people who possessed any of the revealed Books, even if in corrupted
	form, sent to the former Prophets, and they believed in it. And the
	mushriks (idolaters) imply the people who did not follow any Prophet
	nor believed in any Book. Although in the Qur'an the shirk,
	(polytheism, idolatry) of the people of the Book has been mentioned
	at many places, e.g. about the Christians it has been said: &quot;They
	say: God is one of the three&quot; (Al-Ma'idah: 73); &quot;The
	Messiah is son of God&quot; (At Taubah: 30); &quot;The Messiah; son
	of Mary; is God&quot; (Al-Ma'idah: 17); and about the Jews it has
	been said: &quot;They say: Ezra is son of God&quot; (At-Taubah: 30),
	yet nowhere in the Qur'an has the term &quot;mushrlk&quot;been used
	for them, but they have been mentioned as &quot;alladhina
	ul-ul-Kitaba&quot; (those who were given the Book), or by the words
	Jews and Christians. For they believed in the principle of Tauhid
	(Oneness of God) as the we religion, and then committed shirk.
	Contrary to this, for others than the followers of the Book, the
	word mushrik has been used as a. term, for they acknowledged shirk
	(idolatry) as true religion and disacknowledged Tauhid. This
	distinction between the two groups holds good not only in the use of
	the term but also in the Shari`ah injunctions. Animal flesh duly
	slaughtered by the followers of the Book has been declared lawful
	for the Muslims if they slaughter a lawful animal in the name of
	Allah in the prescribed way, and permission to marry their women
	also has been given. On the contrary, neither the animal slaughtered
	by the mushriks is lawful for the Muslims nor is marriage with their
	women.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>That
	is, &quot;There was no means of their being freed from this state of
	unbelief except that a clear evidence (of the truth) should come and
	make them understand the falsity of every form of kufr and its being
	untrue, and should present the right way before them in a clear and
	rational way.&quot; This dces not mean that after the coming of the
	char evidence they would give up kufr but that in the absence of the
	clear evidence it was not at all possible that they would be
	delivered from that state. However, if even after its coming some of
	them still persisted in their kufr, then they themselves would be
	responsible for it; they could not complain that Allah had made no
	arrangement for their guidance. This same thing bas been expressed
	in the Qur'an at different places in different ways, e.g. in Surah
	An-Nahl: 9, it is said: &quot;Allah has taken upon Himself to show
	the Right Way&quot;; in Surah Al-Laila 12, it is said: &quot;It is
	for Us to show the Way&quot;; in Surah An-Nisa: 163-165: &quot;O!
	Prophet, We have sent Revelation to you just as We had sent it to
	Noah and other Prophets after him ... All these Messengers were sent
	as bearers of good news and warners so that, after their coming, the
	people should have no excuse left to plead before Allah&quot;; and
	in Surah Al-Ma'idah: 19: &quot;O people of the Book, this Messenger
	of Ours has come to you and is making clear to you the teachings of
	the Right Way after a long interval during which there had come no
	Messengers, lest you should say: `No bearer of good news nor warner
	came to us. Lo, now the bearer of good news and warner has come.&quot;&nbsp;

	religions as well) vis-a-vis the Holy Qur'an, and finds written in
	them along with sound teachings such things as are not only opposed

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote6sym" HREF="#sdfootnote6anc">6</A>That
	is, the reason why the people of the Book before this were divided
	into countless sects because of different kinds of errors and
	deviation, was not that Allah had failed to send &quot;a clear
	evidence&quot; from Himself for their guidance, but the fact that
	they adopted the wrong way after guidance had come from Allah;
	therefore, they themselves were responsible for their deviation, for
	Allah had fulfilled His obligation towards them. Likewise, since
	their scriptures are no longer pure and their books no longer
	consist of original and correct teachings, Allah by sending a
	Messenger of His, as a clear evidence, with a hallowed Book,
	containing sound and pure teachings, has again fulfilled His
	obligation towards them, so that if even after that they remained
	divided, they themselves should be responsible for it and should
	have no excuse left to plead before Allah. This thing has been
	stated at many places in the Qur'an, e.g. see AI-Baqarah: 213, 253;
	AI-`Imran: 19: Al-Ma'idah: 44-50; Yunus: 93; Ash-Shura: 13-I5;

	is, the message of the same religion, which now the Prophet Muhammad
	(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) is preaching, had been
	given to the people of the Book by the Prophets who came to them and
	by the Books which were sent among them; they had not ban enjoined
	any of the false belief and wicked deeds which they adopted
	afterwards and created different sects. Right and correct religion
	has always been the same: that Allah alone should be served and
	worshiped exclusively, none else be joined with Him in worship, man
	should become worshiper of One Allah alone and obedient to His
	Command only, should establish the salat and pay the zakat. (For
	further explanation, see E. N. 19 of Al-A`raf; E.N.'s: 108,109 of
	Yunus, E.N.'s 43 to 47 of Ar-Rum; E.N.'s 3, 4 of Az-Zumar) . Some
	commentators have taken the words din al-qayyimah in this verse in
	the meaning of din al-millat al-qayyimah: &quot;Religion of the
	righteous community&quot;. Some others have taken qayyimah 'in the
	superlative sense and understood it in the same meaning as we have
	adopted in our translation.&nbsp;

	refused to acknowledge the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's

	from among the mushriks and the followers of the Book, who have not
	acknowledged the Messenger whose emergence by itself is a clear
	evidence, and who is reciting to them hallowed pages containing
	sound and correct teachings, will be as is being described below.&nbsp;

	this reward resolved for him with Allah.&nbsp;
