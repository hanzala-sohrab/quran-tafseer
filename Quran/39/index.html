entire Surah is a most eloquent and effective address which was given
some time before the emigration to Habash, in an environment filled
with tyranny and persecution, ill-will and antagonism, at Makkah. It
is a sermon whose addressees mainly are the unbelieving Quraish,
although here and there the believers also have been addressed. In it
the real aim of the invitation of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
peace and blessings) had been enunciated, which is this:Man should
adopt Allah's servitude sincerely, and should not pollute his God
worship with the service of any other. Presenting this cardinal
principle in different ways over and over again, the truth of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Tauhid
</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">and

</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">and
the evil consequences of following it, have been explained in a most
forceful way, and the people exhorted to give up their wrong way of
life and return to the mercy of their Lord. In this very connection,
the believers have been instructed, as if to say:&quot;If a place has
become narrow for the worship and service of Allah, His earth is
vast: you may emigrate to some other place in order to save your
faith: Allah will reward you for your patience.&quot;On the other
hand, the Holy Prophet has been encouraged, so as to say:&quot;Tell
the disbelievers plainly that they may do whatever they like, but
their persecutions and tyrannies will never deter you from the way of
Islam; that they may go on doing their worst to obstruct your way,
but you will continue to perform your mission in spite of the adverse
conditions and circumstances.&quot; </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

Allah has sent down the best of discourses, a Book all whose parts
are uniform in style<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote43anc" HREF="#sdfootnote43sym"><SUP>43</SUP></A>
and whose themes have been repeated over and over again. Those who
fear their Lord are filled with awe when they hear it, and then their
bodies and their hearts soften and turn to the remembrance of Allah.
This is Allah's guidance, whereby He guides to the Right Way whomever
He wills; and the one whom Allah does not guide has no guide
whatever.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

severe punishment of the Day of Resurrection on his face?<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote44anc" HREF="#sdfootnote44sym"><SUP>44</SUP></A>

Many a people before them also denied likewise. Consequently, the

We have cited for the people in this Qur'an every kind of parable, so
that they may take heed. It is a Qur'an in Arabic<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote46anc" HREF="#sdfootnote46sym"><SUP>46</SUP></A>
without any crookedness in it,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote47anc" HREF="#sdfootnote47sym"><SUP>47</SUP></A>
so that they may guard against the evil end. Allah cites a parable:
There is a man who is shared by many harsh masters, each pulling him
to himself, and there is the other man who entirely belongs to one
master. Can the two be alike in comparison?<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote48anc" HREF="#sdfootnote48sym"><SUP>48</SUP></A>

(O Prophet,) you shall die, and they, too, shall die.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote51anc" HREF="#sdfootnote51sym"><SUP>51</SUP></A>
Then on the Day of Resurrection, you all will present your disputes
before your Lord. Then, who could be more wicked than the one who
invented a falsehood against Allah, and denied the Truth when it came
before him? Is not there in Hell a place for such disbelievers? And

	is a brief introduction to the Surah which only stresses the point
	that the Qur'an is not Muhammad's word, as the disbelievers assert,
	but it is Allah's Word, which He Himself has sent down. Along with
	this, two of Allah's attributes have been mentioned to warn the
	listeners of two realities so that they do not underestimate this
	Word but understand its full importance: (1) That Allah Who has sent
	it down, is All-Mighty; that is, He is so powerful that no power can
	prevent His will and decisions from being enforced and none can dare
	resist Him in any way; (2) that He is All-wise; that is, the
	guidance He is giving in this Book, is wholly based on wisdom, and
	only an ignorant and foolish person can turn away from it. (For
	further explanation, sec E.N. 1 of Surah As-Sajdah).&nbsp;

	is a very important verse, which stasis the real objective of the
	message of Islam. Therefore, one should not pass over it
	superficially, but should try to understand its meaning and
	intention well. It has two basic points without grasping which one
	cannot understand the verse: (1) That the demand is to worship
	Allah; and (2) that the demand is of such worship as may be
	performed by making religion exclusively Allah's. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Ibadat is
	derived from 'abd, and this word is used as an antonym of freeman&quot;
	for the &quot;slave&quot; and `bondsman&quot; in Arabic.
	Accordingly, 'ibadat contains two meanings: (1) Worship and
	devotion; and (2) humble and willing obedience, as is borne out by
	the well-known and authoritative Arabic Lexicon. Lisan al-'Arab.
	Thus, according to the authentic lexical explanation, the demand is
	not only of Allah's worship but also of willing and sincere
	obedience to His Commands and His Law.

	Domination and sovereignty, rulership and political power and
	authority to enforce one's decisions on others.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	practice and the way that a man follows. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In view
	of these three meanings, diin in this verse means: &quot;The way of
	life and attitude which a man adopts after acknowledging the
	supremacy and accepting the obedience of another; &quot; and `to
	worship Allah making one's religion exclusively His&quot; means that
	one should refrain from combining another's worship with the worship
	of Allah, but should worship Allah alone, should follow His Guidance
	alone, and should comply with His Commands and injunctions only.&nbsp;

	is an actual fact and reality, which has been presented as an
	argument for the above demand. It means: &quot;You should worship
	Allah, making din exclusively His, for it is only Allah's right that
	He should be obeyed and worshiped sincerely and exclusively.&quot;
	In other words, there is no one else who may deserve to be worshiped
	so that he also should be served and worshiped besides Allah and his
	commands and laws also obeyed. If a person serves another, apart
	from Allah, sincerely and exclusively, he does wrong. Likewise, if
	he combines the worship of another with his worship of Allah, this
	also is against the truth. The best commentary of this verse is the
	Hadith which Ibn Marduyah has related from Yazid ar-Raqashi. He
	says: A person asked the Holy Prophet: &quot;We give away our wealth
	so that we become well-known. Shall we get a reward for this?&quot;
	The Holy Prophet replied: No. He asked: &quot;What, if one has the
	intention both of Allah's reward and of reputation in the world?&quot;
	The Holy Prophet replied: `Allah does not accept any deed unless it
	is performed exclusively for His sake.&quot; After this he recited

	through Tauhid: there can be no unity through shirk. The polytheists
	the world over have never agreed as to which beings are the definite
	means of access to Allah. Some people have taken some particular
	gods and goddesses as the means, but even among them there is no
	agreement on all the gods and goddesses; some others have taken the
	moon, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, etc. as the means, and they also are
	not agreed as to which of them holds what rank and which is the real
	means of approach to Allah; some others have taken the dead saints
	as the means, but they also differ widely about them: one believes
	in one saint and another in another. The reason is that the belief
	about these different beings is neither based on any knowledge, nor
	has Allah ever sent down a list telling that such and such persons
	are His special favorites; therefore, they only should be made the
	means to have access to Him. This is a creed which has spread among
	the people only on account of superstitions and whims and blind

	after the doctrine of Tauhid has come before them; and (2)
	ungrateful for blessings, i.e. they arc receiving all kinds of

	is, &quot;It is just impossible that Allah should have begotten a
	son. The only possibility is that Allah should choose someone for
	Himself; and whomever He chooses will inevitably be from among the
	creatures, for everything in the world, apart from Allah, is His
	creation. Now, evidently, however exalted and chosen a creature
	might be, it cannot have the position of the offspring. For between
	the Creator and the created there exists a great disparity of nature
	and essence and character, and parenthood necessarily demands that
	there should be the unity of nature and essence between a father and
	his offspring.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides,
	one should also bear in mind the point that the words: &quot;Had
	Allah willed to take a son, He would......&quot; themselves give the
	meaning that Allah has never willed so. Here the object is to
	impress that not to speak of taking a son, Allah has never even

<DIV ID="sdfootnote9">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote9sym" HREF="#sdfootnote9anc">9</A>The
	following are the arguments by which the doctrine of parenthood has
	been refuted: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that Allah is free from every defect and fault and weakness.
	Obviously, children are needed by the one who is defective and weak;
	the one who is mortal stands in need of them, so that his progeny
	should continue to live after him in the world. Likewise, he who
	adopts a son does so either because he feels the need of having an
	heir, being childless himself, or he adopts a son being overpowered
	by love of somebody. Attributing such human weaknesses to Allah and
	forming religious creeds on their basis is nothing but ignorance and
	shortsightedness. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second argument is that Allah in His essence and Being is unique: He
	is not a member of a species, whereas, evidently, offspring must
	necessarily belong to a species. Furthermore, there can be no
	concept of offspring without marriage, and marriage can take place
	only between homogeneous individuals. Therefore, the one who
	proposes offspring for the Unique and Matchless Being like Allah, is
	ignorant and foolish: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	argument is that Allah is Omnipotent, i.e. whatever is there in the
	world is subdued to Him and is held in His powerful grasp. No one in
	this Universe has any resemblance with Him in any way or degree on
	account of which it may be imagined that he has some relation with
	Allah.&nbsp;

	easily after a little thought. Those who were working to turn away
	others (from the Right Way) were present in the same society and
	were doing whatever they could openly and publicly. Therefore, there
	was no need to mention them by name. It was also useless to address
	them, for they were trying to turn away the people from the service
	of Allah, the One, and entrapping them for the service of others,
	and keeping them entrapped for selfish motives. Obviously, such
	people could not be made to see reason by argument, for it lay in
	their own interest not' to understand and see reason, and even after
	understanding they could hardly be inclined to sacrifice their
	interests. However, the condition of the common people who were
	being deceived and cheated, was certainly pitiable. They had no
	interest involved in the business; therefore, they could be
	convinced by reasoning and argument, and after a little
	understanding they could also see what advantages were being gained
	by those who were showing them the way to other deities, after

	is, &quot;He does not approve, not for any interest of His own but
	for the interest and benefit of the servants themselves, that they
	should disbelieve, for disbelief is harmful for them.&quot; Here,
	one should bear in mind the fact that Allah's will is one thing and
	His approval and pleasure another. Nothing in the world can happen
	against Allah's will, but many things can happen against His
	approval, and arc happening day and night. For example, the
	dominance of the tyrants and the wicked in the world, the existence
	of thieves and robbers, the presence of murderers and adulterers,
	are possible only because Allah has made room for the occurrence of
	these evils and the existence of these criminals in the scheme of
	things ordained by Him. Then He provides opportunities also of
	committing evil just as He provides opportunities to the good of
	doing good. Had He made no room for these evils and had provided no
	opportunities of committing wrongs to the evildoers, no evil would
	have ever occurred in the world. All this is based on Allah's Will.
	But the occurrence of an act under Divine Will does not mean that
	Allah's approval also goes with it. This may be explained by an
	example. If a person tries to obtain his living only by lawful
	means, Allah provides him his living through those means. This is
	His will. But providing for the thief or the robber or the corrupt
	person under the will does not mean that Allah also likes stealing
	and robbery and taking of bribes. Allah says the same thing here, as
	if to say: &quot;If you want to disbelieve, you may do so: We will
	not stop you from this nor make you believe forcibly. But We do not
	approve that you should deny your Creator and Providence, being His
	servants, for it is harmful for yourselves: Our Godhead is not

	is loss of a person's capital and failure of his business so that he
	is unable to pay his debts in full. This same metaphor Allah has
	used here for the disbelievers and polytheists, The sum total of
	whatever man has got in this world-his life, his intellect, body,
	powers, capabilities, means and opportunities-is in fact, the
	capital, which he invests in the business of the worldly life. If a

	no God, or that there are many gods, whose servant he is, and that
	he is not accountable to anyone, or that someone else will rescue
	him on Judgment Day, it would mean that he made a losing bargain and
	lost all his capital. This is his first loss. His second loss is
	that in everything that he did, on the basis of the wrong
	hypothesis, he went on wronging himself and many other men, and the
	coming generations and many other creatures of Allah, throughout his
	life. Thus, he got into countless debts, but has no money with which
	he may fully pay his debts. Over and above this, he has not only
	himself incurred this loss, but has caused the same loss to his
	children and near and dear once and friends and fellow countrymen by
	his wrong education and training and wrong example. It is these
	three losses together which Allah has called khusran-i-mubin (utter

	Opening of a man's breast for something is, in fact, a state in
	which there remains no anxiety or ambiguity or suspicion and doubt

	and loss in accepting and adopting it, but he decides with full
	satisfaction of the heart that it is the Truth; therefore, he must
	follow it whatever be the consequences. Having made such a decision

	receives from Allah and His Messenger willingly and with pleasure,
	without any hesitation. He accepts whatever beliefs and ideas, rules
	and regulations, he comes across in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah
	of His Prophet as if they were the voice of his own heart. He does
	not feel any compunction on giving up an unlawful gain, because he
	believes that it was no gain for him at all; it was rather a loss
	from which Allah saved him by His grace. Likewise, even if he incurs
	a loss while following the way of righteousness, he does not feel
	sad about this but bears it with patience and regards it as an
	ordinary loss as compared to the loss of turning away from the Way
	of Allah. The same is his behavior on confronting dangers. He

	order to avoid the danger. The Straight Way of Allah is only one,

	in this parable has explained the difference between shirk and
	Tauhid and the impact each has on human life so clearly that it is
	not possible to put across such a vast theme so concisely and
	effectively in other words. Everyone will admit that the person who
	has many masters, each one pulling hire to himself, and the masters
	also so ill-tempered that no one spares him time in his service to
	obey the other, and no one rests content only with threatening and
	cursing him if he fails to carry out his command from among the
	contradictory commands of the other masters, but is bent upon
	punishing him, his life would certainly be in great anguish. On the
	contrary, the person who is the slave or servant of only one master,
	would be living a life of ease and comfort because he will not have
	to serve and seek the pleasure of another master. This is such a
	straightforward thing which does not need deep consideration for its
	understanding. After this it remains no longer difficult for a
	person to understand that the peace of mind and satisfaction that
	accrue to him from the service of One God, can never accrue from the
	service of many gods. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, it
	should be understood well that the parable of many ill-tempered and
	contesting masters cannot apply to the images of stone, but it only
	applies to living masters, who practically give contradictory
	commands to man and keep pulling him to themselves in actual
	reality. One such master sits in one's own self, which presents
	before him desires of every kind and compels him to fulfill them.
	Other countless masters are there in the house, in the family, in
	the brotherhood, in the society, among the religious guides and the
	rulers and legislators, in the business and economic circles and
	among the dominant powers of civilization whose contradictory
	demands and requirements keep on pulling man to themselves at All
	times; then any god whose demand he fails to fulfill in any way,
	does not let him go unpunished in his own circle. However, each
	one's instrument of punishment is different. Someone causes a
	heart-break, another takes offense, another humiliates, another
	boycotts, another bankrupts, another makes a religious or a legal
	attack. Man has no other way of being saved from this anguish and
	agony but to adopt the Way of Tauhid and become the slave of One
	God, and throw off the yoke of servitude of every other god. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Adoption
	of the Way of Tauhid also has two forms, which lead to different
	results: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that an individual should decide to become the servant of One God
	individually but his environment is hostile. In this case the
	external conflict and his anguish and agony might increase, but if
	he has adopted the Way sincerely, internal peace and satisfaction
	will necessarily accrue. He will turn down every such desire of the
	self as goes against the Divine Commands, or whose fulfillment may
	clash with the demands of God-worship. He will also reject every
	such demand of the family, society, nation, government, religious
	guides and economic powers that conflicts with the Divine Law.
	Consequently, he might have to face extreme hardships, rather he
	will surely face, but his heart will have full satisfaction that he
	is fulfilling the demand of the servitude of that God Whose servant
	he actually is, and that those whose servant he is not, have no
	right on him, because of which he may have to serve them against the
	Command of his God. No power of the world can deprive him of this
	satisfaction of the heart and peace of mind; so much so that even if
	he has to go to the gallows for its sake, he will go to it with a
	clear conscience, and he will have no compunction as to why he did
	not save his life by bowing before the false gods. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second form is that the whole society be established on the basis of
	the Tauhid imbibing the principles of morality, civilization,
	culture, education, religion, law, social custom, politics,
	economics in every sphere of life as a creed, which the Master of
	the Universe has given through His Book and His Messenger. The law
	should declare as a crime everything which God's religion has
	declared sinful and the government administration should try to
	eradicate the same; the system of education and training should
	prepare the minds and character to avoid the same; the same should
	be condemned from the religious pulpit, and regarded as vicious and
	forbidden in every economic enterprise. Likewise, everything that
	Allah's religion has declared as good and virtuous should be
	protected and defended by the law, developed by the administrative
	forces, impressed in the minds and instilled in character by the
	entire system of education and training, infused from the religious
	pulpit, admired by the society and followed by it practically and
	enforced in every economic enterprise. This is how man can attain to
	perfect internal and external peace and satisfaction, and all the
	doors to material and spiritual progress are thrown open, for the
	conflict in it between God-worship and the worship of others would
	be reduced to the minimum. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Although
	Islam invites every single individual to adopt Tauhid as his creed
	and to worship Allah alone, braving every danger and hardship, even
	in the absence of the established order, it cannot be denied that
	Islam's ultimate aim and object is to establish this second order,
	and the same has been the objective of the endeavors of all the
	Prophets: to bring into existence a community of the Muslims, who
	should follow Allah's religion collectively, free from the
	domination and influence of unbelief and the unbelievers, No one.
	unless he is unaware of the Qur'an and the Sunnah and senseless, can
	say that the objective of the Prophets' struggle has been only the
	faith and obedience of the individual, and that it has never been
	their aim to enforce and establish Islam in the society and state.&nbsp;

	'Allama Ibn Kathir, to address such a thing to the common men does
	not mean that Allah forgives all sins without repentance, but Allah
	Himself has explained in the following verses that sins are forgiven
	only when the sinner turns to Allah's worship and service and adopts
	obedience to the message sent down by Him. As a matter of fact, this
	verse brought a message of hope for those people who had committed
	mortal sins like murder, adultery, theft, robbery, etc. in the days
	of ignorance, and had despaired whether they would ever be forgiven.
	To them it has been said: &quot;Do not despair of Allah's mercy:
	whatever you might have done in the past, if you sincerely turn to
	your Lord's obedience, you will be forgiven every sin.&quot; The
	same interpretation of this verse has been given by Ibn `Abbas,
	Qatadah, Mujahid and Ibn Zaid. (Ibn Jarir, Bukhari, Muslim, Abu
