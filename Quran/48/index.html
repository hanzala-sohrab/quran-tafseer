<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
events in connection with which this Surah was sent down began life
this: One day the Holy Prophet saw in a dream that he had gone to
Makkah with his Companions and had performed the umrah there.
Obviously, the Prophet's dream could not be a mere dream and fiction
for it is a kind of Divine inspiration as Allah Himself has confirmed
in verse 27 below and said that He Himself had shown that dream to
His Messenger. Therefore, it was not merely a dream but a Divine
inspiration which the Holy Prophet had to obey and follow. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Apparently,
there was no possible way of acting on this inspiration. The
disbelieving Quraish had debarred the Muslims from proceeding to the
Ka'bah for the past six years and no Muslim had been allowed during
that period to approach the Kabah for the purpose of performing hajj
and umrah. Therefore, it could not be expected that they would allow
the Holy Prophet to enter Makkah along with a party of his
Companions. If they had proceeded to Makkah in the pilgrim garments
with the intention of performing umrah, along with their arms, this
would have provoked the enemy to war, and if they had proceeded
unarmed, this would have meant endangering his own as well as his
Companions' lives. Under conditions such as these nobody could see
and suggest how the Divine inspiration could be acted upon. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But
the Prophet's position was different. It demanded that he should
carry out whatever Command his Lord gave fearlessly and without any
apprehension and doubt. Therefore, the Holy Prophet informed his
Companions of his dream and began to make preparations for the
journey. Among the tribes living in the suburbs also he had the
public announcement made that he was proceeding for umrah and the
people could join him. Those who could only see the apparent
conditions thought that he and his Companions were going into the
very jaws of death none of them therefore was inclined to accompany
him in the expedition. But those who had true faith in Allah and His
Messenger were least bothered about the consequences. For them this
information was enough that it was a Divine inspiration and Allah's
Prophet had made up his mind to carry it into effect. After this
nothing could hinder them from accompanying the Messenger of Allah.
Thus, 1,400 of the Companions became ready to follow him on this
highly dangerous journey. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

A. H. 6. At Dhul Hulaifah they entered the pilgrims robe with the

indicating that they were sacrificial animals; kept only a sword each
in sheaths, which the pilgrims to the Kabah were allowed to carry
according to the recognized custom of Arabia, but no other weapon.

Makkah, chanting the prescribed slogan of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Labbaik,

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
nature of the relations between Makkah and Madinah in those days was
known too well to every Arab. Just the previous year, in Shawwal A.
H. 5, the Quraish mustering the united strength of the Arab tribes
had invaded Madinah and the well known Battle of the Trench had taken
place. Therefore, when the Holy Prophet along with such a large
caravan set off for the home of his blood-thirsty enemy, the whole of
Arabia looked up with amazement, and the people also noticed that the
caravan was not going with the intention to fight but was proceeding
to the House of Allah in a forbidden month in the pilgrims garb
carrying sacrificial animals and was absolutely unarmed. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Quraish were confounded at this bold step taken by the Holy Prophet.
Dhil-Qa'dah was one of those forbidden months which had been held as
sacred for pilgrimage in Arabia for centuries. Nobody had a right to
interfere with a caravan which might be coming for hajj or umrah in
the pilgrims garb in this month; so much so that even an enemy tribe
could not hinder it from passing through its territory according to
the recognized law of the land. The Quraish therefore were caught in
a dilemma, for if they attacked this caravan from Madinah and stopped
it from entering Makkah, this would arouse a clamor of protest in the
whole country, and all the Arab tribes would have the misgiving that
the Quraish had monopolized the Ka'bah as exclusively their own, and
every tribe would be involved in the mistrust that now it depended on
the will of the Quraish to allow or not to allow anyone to perform
hajj or umrah in the future and that they would stop any tribe with
which they were angry from visiting the Ka'bah just as they had
stopped the Madinese pilgrims. This they thought would be a grave
mistake, which would cause the entire Arabia to revolt against them.
But, on the other hand, if they allowed Muhammad (upon whom be
Allah's peace and blessings) and his large caravan to enter their
city safely, they would lose their image of power in Arabia and the
people would say that they were afraid of Muhammad. At last, after a
great deal of confusion, perplexity and hesitation they were overcome
by their false sense of honor and for the sake of their prestige they
took the decision that they would at no cost allow the caravan to
enter the city of Makkah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Holy Prophet had dispatched a man of the Bani Ka'b as a secret agent
so that he may keep him fully informed of the intentions and
movements of the Quraish. When the Holy Prophet reached Usfan, he
brought the news that the Quraish had reached Dhi Tuwa with full
preparations and they had sent Khalid bin Walid with two hundred
cavalry men in advance towards Kura'al-Ghamim to intercept him. The
Quraish wanted somehow to provoke the Holy Prophet's Companions into
fighting so that they may tell the Arabs that those people had
actually come to fight and had put on the pilgrims garments for umrah
only to deceive others. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Immediately
on receipt of this information the Holy Prophet changed his route and
following a very rugged, rocky track reached Hudaibiyah, which was
situated right on the boundary of the sacred Makkan territory. Here,
he was visited by Budail bin Warqa the chief of the Bani Khuza'ah,
along with some men of his tribe. They asked what he had come for.
The Holy Prophet replied that he and his Companions bad come only for
pilgrimage to the House of Allah and for going round it in worship
and not for war. The men of Khuza'ah went and told this to the
Quraish chiefs and counseled them not to interfere with the pilgrims.
But the Quraish were obstinate. They sent Hulays bin Alqamah, the
chief of the Ahabish, to the Holy Prophet to persuade him to go back.
Their object was that when Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace)
would not listen to Hulays, he would come back disappointed and then
the entire power of the Ahabish would be on their side. But when
Hulays went and saw that the whole caravan had put on the pilgrims
garments, had brought sacrificial camels with festive collars round
their necks, and had come for doing reverence to the House of Allah
and not to fight, he returned to Makkah without having any dialogue
with the Holy Prophet and told the Quraish chiefs plainly that those
people bad no other object but to pay a visit to the Ka'bah; if they
debarred them from it, the Ahabish would not join them in that,
because they had not become their allies to support them if they
violated the sacred customs and traditions. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
the Quraish sent `Urwah bin Mas'ud Thaqafi; he had lengthy
negotiations with the Holy Prophet in an effort to persuade him to
give up his intention to enter Makkah. But the Holy Prophet gave him
also the same reply that he had given to the chief of the Khuza'ah,
that they had not come to fight but to do honor to the House of Allah
and carry out a religious duty. Urwah went back and said to the
Quraish: &quot;I have been to the courts of the Caesar and Khosroes,
and the Negus also, but by God, never have I seen any people so
devoted to a king as are the Companions of Muhammad (upon whom be
Allah's peace and blessings) to him. If Muhammad makes his ablutions
they would not let the water thereof fall on the ground but would rub
it on their bodies and clothes. Now you may decide as to what you
should do.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the meantime when the messages were coming and the negotiations were
going on, the Quraish tried again and again to quietly launch sudden
attacks on the Muslim camp in order to provoke the Companions and
somehow incite them to war, but every time they did so the
Companions' forbearance and patience and the Holy Prophet's wisdom
and sagacity frustrated their designs. On one occasion forty or fifty
of their men came at night and attacked the Muslim camp with stones
and arrows. The Companions arrested all of them and took them before
the Holy Prophet, but he let them go. On another occasion 80 men came
from the direction of Tan'im right at the time of the Fajr Prayer and
made a sudden attack. They were also caught, but the Holy Prophet
forgave them, too. Thus, the Quraish went on meeting failure after
failure in every one of their designs. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At
last, the Holy Prophet sent Hadrat Uthman (may Allah be pleased with
him) as his own messenger to Makkah with the message that they had
not come to fight but only for pilgrimage and had brought their
sacrificial camels along, and they would go back after performing the
rite of pilgrimage and offering the sacrifice. But the Quraish did
not agree and withheld Hadrat Uthman in the city. In the meantime a
rumor spread that Hadrat Uthman had been killed; and when he did not
return in time the Muslims took the rumor to be true. Now they could
show no more forbearance. Entry into Makkah was different for there
was no intention to use force. But when the ambassador was put to
death, the Muslims had no alternative but to prepare for war.
Therefore, the Holy Prophet summoned all his Companions together and
took a solemn pledge from them that they would fight to death. In
view of the critical occasion it was not an ordinary undertaking. The
Muslims numbered only 1400 and had come without any weapons, were
encamping at the boundary of Makkah, 250 miles away from their own
city, and the enemy could attack them in full strength, and could
surround them with its allies from the adjoining tribes as well. In
spite of this, none from the caravan except one man failed to give
his pledge to fight to death, and there could be no greater proof of
their dedication and sincerity than that in the cause of Allah. This
pledge is well known in the history of Islam as the pledge of Ridwan.

it was known that the news about Hadrat Uthman was false. Not only
did he return but under Suhail bin 'Amr from the Quraish also arrived
a deputation to negotiate peace with the Holy Prophet. Now, the
Quraish no more insisted that they would disallow the Holy Prophet
and his Companions to enter Makkah. However, in order to save their
face they only insisted that he went back that year but could come
the following year to perform the umrah. After lengthy negotiations
peace was concluded on the following terms: </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
the conditions of the treaty were being settled, the whole of the
Muslim army was feeling greatly upset. No one understood the
expedience because of which the Holy Prophet was accepting the
conditions. No one was far sighted enough to foresee the great
benefit that was to result from this treaty. The disbelieving Quraish
looked at it as their victory, and the Muslims were upset as to why
they should be humiliated to accepting those mean conditions. Even a
statesman of th caliber of Hadrat Umar says that he had never given
way to doubt since the time he had embraced Islam but on this
occasion he also could not avoid it. Impatient he went to Hadrat Abu
Bakr and said &quot;Is he (the Holy Prophet) not Allah's Messenger,
and are we not Muslims, and are they not polytheists? Then, why
should we agree to what is humiliating to our Faith?&quot; He replied
&quot;O Umar, he is surely Allah's Messenger, and Allah will never
make him the loser.&quot; Unsatisfied he went to the Holy Prophet
himself and put the same questions to him, and he also gave him the
same replies as Hadrat Abu Bakr had given. Afterwards Hadrat Umar
continued to offer voluntary prayers and give aims so that Allah may
pardon his insolence that he had shown towards the Holy Prophet on
that occasion. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Two
things in the treaty were highly disturbing for the Muslims first,
the second condition, about which they said that it was an expressly
unfair condition, for if they had to return a fugitive from Makkah,
why should not the Quraish return a fugitive from Madinah? To this
the Holy Prophet replied: &quot;What use would be he to us, who fled
from us to them? May Allah keep him away from us!And if we return the
one who flees to us from them, Allah will create some other way out
for him.&quot; The other thing that was rankling in their minds was
the fourth condition. The Muslims thought that agreeing to it meant
that they were going back unsuccessful and this was humiliating.
Furthermore, the question that was causing them feel upset wad that
they had accepted the condition of going back without performing the
pilgrimage to the Ka'bah, whereas the Holy Prophet had seen in the
vision that they were performing tawaf at Makkah. To this the Holy
Prophet replied that in his vision the year had not been specified.
According to the treaty conditions, therefore, they would perform the

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Right
at the time when the document was being written, Suhail bin 'Amr's
own son, Abu Jandal, who had become a Muslim and been imprisoned by
the pagans of Makkah somehow escaped to the Holy Prophet's camp. He
had fetters on his feet and signs of violence on his body. He
implored the Holy Prophet that he help secure his release from
imprisonment. The scene only increased the Companions' dejection, and
they were moved beyond control. But Suhail bin 'Amr said the
conditions of the agreement had been concluded between them although
the writing was not yet complete; therefore, the boy should be
returned to them. The Holy Prophet admitted his argument and Abu
Jandal was returned to his oppressors. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
the document was finished, the Holy Prophet spoke to the Companions
and told them to slaughter their sacrificial animals at that very
place, shave their heads and put off the pilgrim garments, but no one
moved from his place. The Holy Prophet repeated the order thrice but
the Companions were so overcome by depression and dejection that they
did not comply. During his entire period of apostleship on no
occasion had it ever happened that he should command his Companions
to do a thing and they should not hasten to comply with it. This
caused him a great shock, and he repaired to his tent and expressed
his grief before his wife, Hadrat Umm Salamah. She said, &quot;You
may quietly go and slaughter your own camel and call the barber and
have your head shaved. After that the people would automatically do
what you did and would understand that whatever decision had been
taken would not be changed.&quot; Precisely the same thing happened.
The people slaughtered their animals, shaved their heads or cut their
hair short and put off the pilgrim garb, but their hearts were still
afflicted with grief. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

(or according to some others, at Kura' al-Ghamim), which told the
Muslims that the treaty that they were regarding an their defeat, was
indeed a great victory. After it had come down, the Holy Prophet
summoned the Muslims together and said: &quot;Today such a thing has
been sent down to me, which is more valuable to me than the world and
what it contains.&quot; Then be recited this Surah, especially to
Hadrat Umar, for he was the one who was feeling most dejected. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>These
were the blessings that the Muslims gained from the peace treaty
which they were looking upon as their defeat and the Quraish as their
victory. However, what had troubled the Muslims most in this treaty,
was the condition about the fugitives from Makkah and Madinah, that
the former would be returned and the latter would not be returned.
But not much long afterwards this condition also proved to be
disadvantageous for the Quraish, and experience revealed what far
reaching consequences of it had the Holy Prophet fore seen and then
accepted it. A few days after the treaty a Muslim of Makkah, Abu
Basir, escaped from the Quraish and reached Madinah. The Quraish
demanded him back and the Holy Prophet returned him to their men who
had been sent from Makkah to arrest him. But while on the way to
Makkah he again fled and went and sat on the road by the Red Sea
shore, which the trade caravans of the Quraish took to Syria. After
that every Muslim who succeeded in escaping from the Quraish would go
and join Abu Basir instead of going to Madinah, until 70 men gathered
there. They would attack any Quraish caravan that passed the way and
cut it into pieces at last, the Quraish themselves begged the Holy
Prophet to call those men to Madinah, and the condition relating to
the return of the fugitives of itself became null and void. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>When
	after the treaty of Hudaibiyah this good news of the victory was
	announced, .the people wondered as to how the treaty could be called
	a victory. The Muslims did believe in this Divine Revelation as true
	on the basis of their Faith, but no one could understand what aspect
	of the victory it had. On hearing this verse, Hadrat 'Umar asked:
	&quot;Is it a victory, O Messenger of Allah?&quot; The Holy Prophet
	replied: &quot;Yes.&quot; (lbn Jarir) Another Companion came before
	the Holy Prophet and he also put the same question; whereupon the
	Holy Prophet replied: &quot;By Him in Whose hand is the life of
	Muhammad, this indeed is a victory.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud)
	On arriving at Madinah still another person said to his companions:
	&quot;What sort of a victory is it? We were debarred from the House
	of Allah; our sacrificial camels also could not go to their right
	places; the Holy Messenger of Allah had to halt at Hudaibiyah, and
	in consequence of this truce two of our oppressed brothers (Abu
	Jandal and Abu Basir) were handed over to their oppressors.&quot;
	When this thing reached the Holy Prophet, he said; &quot;A vary
	wrong thing has been uttered: it indeed is a great victory. You
	reached the very home of the polytheists, and they had to persuade
	you to go back by soliciting you to perform 'Umrah the following
	year; they themselves expressed the desire to suspend hostilities
	and have peace with you, whereas-their malice and enmity against you
	is too well-known. Allah has granted you the upper hand over them.
	Have you forgotten the day when you were fleeing from Uhud and I was
	calling you back from behind? Have you forgotten the day when the
	enemy had descended on us from every side in the Battle of the
	Trench and the hearts were coming up to the throats?&quot; (Baihaqi
	on the authority of 'Urwah bin Zubair) . But not long after this the
	truce's being a victory began to become manifest, and everyone
	realized that the triumph of Islam had begun with the treaty of
	Hudaibiyah. Almost one and the same thing has been related from
	Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Hadrat Jabir bin `Abdullah and Hadrat
	Bara' bin 'Azib. They are reported to have said: &quot;The people
	look upon the Conquest of Makkah as the victory, but we regard the
	truce of Hudaibiyah as the real victory.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim,
	Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Jarir). &nbsp;

	the context in which this sentence occurs is kept in view, one will
	certainly feel that the faults referred to here imply those
	shortcomings and weaknesses that had remained in the struggle that
	the Muslims had been making for the success and victory of Islam,
	under the leadership of the Holy Prophet, for the past nineteen
	years or so. These shortcomings are not known to any one because the
	intellect is absolutely helpless to find out any weakness in that
	struggle. But according to the highest standards of perfection in
	the sight of Allah there had remained some such weakness in it
	because of which the Muslims could not attain a decisive victory so
	soon over the pagans of Arabia. What Allah means to say is this: &brvbar;If
	you had carried on your struggle along with those weaknesses, it
	would have taken you much longer to subdue Arabia, but We have
	overlooked all those weaknesses and shortcomings and compensated for
	them only through Our grace, and opened for you at Hudaibiyah the
	door to victory and conquest which you could not have achieved only
	by your ordinary endeavors&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here,
	this thing also should be understood well that for the weaknesses
	that might occur and remain in the struggle and endeavor that a
	group might be making for an object, the leader and guide of the
	group only is addressed. This does not mean that the weaknesses are
	the leader's personal weaknesses. Those are, in fact, the weaknesses
	of the struggle that the group is making as a whole; but the address
	is made to the leader to tell him that his work suffers from such
	and such a weakness.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">However,
	as the address is directed to the Holy Prophet and declared that
	Allah has forgiven him all his former and latter faults, the general
	words also give this meaning that Allah pardoned all the
	shortcomings (which were the shortcomings in view of his high
	position) of His Holy Messenger. That is why when the Companions saw
	that he took extraordinary pains over his worship, they would say:
	`Why do you subject yourself to such hardships when all your former
	and latter errors and shortcomings have been pardoned?&quot; the
	Holy Prophet would reply: &quot;Should I not behave as a grateful
	servant?&quot; (Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud). &nbsp;

	Islamic law and commandments, secure from every fear, every
	resistance and every external interference, and they should also be
	blessed with the power that they may uphold Allah's Word throughout

	hindrance in the way of Allah's worship and an obstacle in the

	the believers; the Qur'an calls it 'fitnah &quot; (mischief).
	Delivered and freed from this calamity when they arc able to achieve

<DIV ID="sdfootnote6">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote6sym" HREF="#sdfootnote6anc">6</A>&quot;Sakinat&quot;
	in Arabic is calmness and tranquility and peace of mind. Here Allah
	calls its being sent into the hearts of the believers an important
	factor in the victory that Islam and the Muslims achieved at
	Hudaibiyah. From a study of the conditions of the tuns one comes to
	know what kind of a Sakinat it was that was sent down into the
	hearts of the Muslims during that period and how it became a source
	of victory. If at the time when the Holy Prophet expressed his
	intention to go for 'Umrah to Makkah, the Muslims had become
	terror-stricken and started behaving like the hypocrites as if they
	were going into the very jaws of death, or if at the time when they
	heard the news on the way that the disbelieving Quraish were coming
	out in great strength to fight them, they had been alarmed as to how
	they would face the enemy un-armed, and thus become panic-stricken,
	obviously no benefits would have resulted from Hudaibiyah at all.
	Then, if at the time when at Hudaibiyah the disbelievers had stopped
	the Muslims from going any further, and when they had tried to
	provoke them by launching against them repeated sudden attacks, and
	when the rumor of Hadrat 'Uthman's martyrdom had spread, and when
	Abu Jandal had appeared on the scene as the very image of oppression
	and persecution, the Muslims had actually become provoked and broken
	the discipline that the Holy Prophet had instilled in them, the
	result would have been disastrous. Above all, if at the time when
	the Holy Prophet was going to conclude the treaty on the conditions
	which were un-acceptable to the entire party of the Muslims, the
	Muslims had happened to disobey him, the great victory of Hudaibiyah
	would have turned into a humiliating defeat. Thus, it was all
	because of Allah's bounty that on all these critical moments the
	Muslims were blessed with full peace of mind with regard to the
	leadership and guidance of the Holy Prophet, the truth of Islam and
	the truthfulness of their mission. This is why they decided with a
	cool mind that they would face and accept whatever hardships they
	would encounter in the way of Allah; that is why they remained safe
	from fear, confusion, provocation and despair; that is why perfect
	discipline continues to prevail in the camp; and that is why, in
	spite of being deeply grieved at the conditions of peace, they
	submitted to the decision taken by the Holy Prophet. This was the
	sakinat that Allah had sent down into the hearts of the Muslims, and
	it was all because of this that the dangerous step of undertaking a
	journey for performing 'Umrah became the prelude to a unique
	victory. &nbsp;

	His Religion, who shirk endangering their interests, their lives and
	wealth for the sake of Allah's Religion when the time comes of their

	of disbelief on the basis of which somebody in the world may be
	regarded as excommunicated from Islam, but this is the disbelief
	because of which he will be declared a disbeliever in the Hereafter.
	The reason is that the Holy Prophet even after the revelation of
	this verse did not regard as outside Islam those people in respect
	of whom it was sent down, nor treated them like the disbelievers.&nbsp;

	again the pledge taken from the Companions at Hudaibiyah has been
	mentioned. This is called Bai 'at Ridwan. for Allah in this verse
	has given the good news that he became well pleased with those who
	on this dangerous occasion did not show the least hesitation in
	offering their lives for the cause of Islam and gave an express
	proof of their being true in their faith by taking the pledge on the
	hand of the Holy Prophet. The Muslims at this time were equipped
	only with a sword each. numbered only 1,400, were unprepared for
	warfare, but were donning the pilgrim garments, were 25 miles away
	from their military headquarters (Madinah), while the enemy's
	stronghold (Makkah) where from it could get any kind of help was
	just 13 miles off. Had these people been lacking in their sincerity
	of Allah and His Messenger and His Religion in any degree, they
	would have abandoned the Messenger on this extremely dangerous
	occasion, and Islam would have been vanquished for ever. Apart from
	their own sincerity there was no external pressure under which they
	might have been compelled to take the pledge. Their becoming ready
	at that time to fight in the cause of Allah's Religion regardless of
	the dangers, is a clear proof that they were true and sincere in
	their Faith and loyal to th &ograve; cause of Allah and His
	Messenger in the highest degree. That is why Allah honored them with
	this certificate of His good pleasure. Now it some one becomes angry
	with them after they have been honored with this certificate of
	Allah's good pleasure, or slanders and vilifies them, his enmity is
	with Allah, not with them. Those who say that at that time when
	Allah honored them with this certificate of His good pleasure, they
	were sincere, but afterwards they became disloyal to Allah and His
	Messenger, perhaps harbor a mistrust about Allah that while sending
	down this verse He was unaware of their future; therefore, He
	awarded them this warrant only in view of their state at that time,
	and probably due to the same unawareness inscribed this verse in His
	Holy Book as well so that afterwards also, when those people have
	turned disloyal, the world should continue reading this verse about
	them and praising the knowledge of the unseen of that Allah Who, God
	forbid, had granted these faithless and disloyal people the warrant
	of His good pleasure.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">About the
	Tree under which this pledge was taken Ibn `Umar's slave Hadrat
	Nafi's tradition has generally spread saying that the people had
	started visiting it and offering Prayers by it, so that when Hadrat
	'Umar came to know of it, he rebuked and warned the people and
	ordered it to be cut down . ( Tabaqat Ibn Sa'd, vol. II, p. l00).
	But there are several other traditions which contradict it. A
	tradition from Hadrat Nafi' himself has been reported in Tabaqat of
	Ibn S`ad to the effect that many years after the Bai at Ridwan the
	Companions looked for the Tree but they could not recognize it and
	differed as to which tree it was. (p. 106). The second tradition has
	been reported in Bukhari, Muslim, and Tabaqat on the authority of
	Hadrat Said bin al-Musayyab. He says that his father was one of
	those who had participated in the Bai `at Ridwan. He told him that
	when they had gone for 'Umrah al-Qada the following year, they had
	forgotten the Tree, and they could not locate it even after looking
	for it. The third tradition is from lbn Jarir. He says that when
	Hadrat `Umar during his caliphate passed by Hudaibiyah, he inquired
	about the Tree under which the pledge had been sworn. Someone
	pointed to one tree and another one to another tree. At this Hadrat
	`Umar told the people to forget it as there was no real need to
	bother about it.

	them in the forefront, there is no harm in shooting at them, and it
	is not obligatory for the Muslims to expiate and pay any blood-money

	better position militarily against the Muslims, it is lawful to
	resort to shelling, but even then every effort should be made to
	save the Muslims as far as possible. Furthermore, Imam Shafe'i also
	says that if during a conflict the disbelievers put a Muslim in
	front as a shield and a Muslim kills him, there can be two possible
	alternatives: either the killer knew that the murdered person was a
	Muslim, or he did not know that he was a Muslim. In the first case,

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote48sym" HREF="#sdfootnote48anc">48</A>Here,
	about the words insha'-Allah (if Allah so wills), which Allah
	Himself has used with His promise, one can raise the objection that
	when Allah Himself is making this promise, what is the meaning of
	making it conditional upon His own willing it? The answer is: Here
	the words insha'-Allah have not been used in the sense that if Allah
	does not will, He will not fulfill His promise, but in fact these
	relate to the background in which this promise was made. The
	presumption on the basis of which the disbelievers of Makkah had
	played the drama of preventing the Muslims from `Umrah was that only
	he whom they would allow would perform `Umrah, and would perform it
	only when they would allow it At this Allah has said: &quot;This
	depends on Our, not on their, will. The reason why 'Umrah has not
	been performed this year is not because the disbelievers of Makkah
	did not allow it to be performed, but because We did not will it to
	be performed; in the future 'Umrah will be performed if We will, no
	matter whether the disbelievers allow it or disallow it.&quot;
	Besides, these words also contain the meaning that the Muslims too,
	will perform `Umrah not by their own power but because We would will
	that they should perform it; otherwise if We do not will, they do
	not possess any power to perform it by themselves.&quot;</P>

	reason why this thing has been mentioned here is that when at
	Hudaibiyah the peace treaty was going to be written down, the
	disbelievers had objected to the use of the words Rasul-Allah
	(Messenger of Allah) with the name of the Holy Prophet, and on their
	insistence the Holy Prophet himself had wiped off these words from
	the document. At this Allah says: &quot;Our Messenger's being a
	Messenger is a reality which remains unaffected whether someone
	believes in it or not. If some people do not believe in it, they may
	not, for &quot;Allah is enough for a witness&quot; over it. Their
	denial will not change the reality, but the Guidance and the true
	Faith which this Messenger has brought from Us, shall prevail over
	all religion, no matter how hard the deniers try to obstruct its
	progress.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;All
	religion&quot; implies all those ways of life which include the
	nature of din (religion). We have explained it fully in E.N. 3 of
	Surah Az-Zumar and E.N. 20 of Surah Ash-Shura above. Here what Allah
	has stated in clear words is: The purpose of the Holy Prophet's
	appointment as a Prophet was not merely to preach this Religion but
	to make it prevail over all others. In other words, he did not bring
	this Religion so that it might survive in a limited compartment of
	life which is allowed it by the dominant religion, while the rest of
	the spheres of life, by and large, should remain under the
	relentless control of some false religion. But he had brought it so
	that it should be the dominant Religion of life and any other
	religion should survive, if at all it survives, only within the
	limits in which it allows it to survive. (For further explanation,
	sec E.N. 48 of Surah Az-Zumar). &nbsp;

	does not imply the mark that appears on the forehead of some people
	on account of prostrations, but it implies the marks and traces of
	the fear of God, munificence, nobility and goodness of manner that
	naturally appears on the face of a person on account of bowing down
	before God. Man's face is an open book on the pages of which
	different states of a man's self can be seen easily. A vain and
	arrogant person's face is different from the face of a humble,
	modest and unassuming person; an immoral person's face is clearly
	distinguished from the face of a righteous and well-mannered person;
	and there is a marked difference between the facial appearance of a
	wicked man and of a noble and virtuous man. What Allah means to say
	is: &quot;The Companions of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace)
	are such that one can recognize them on first sight to be the best
	of mankind, because their faces shine forth with the light of
	God-worship and God -consciousness.&quot; This is the same thing
	about which Imam Malik has said that when the armies of the

	he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should east seed into
	the ground: And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed
	should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how. For the earth
	bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear,
	after that the full corn in the ear. But when the fruit is brought
	forth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the harvest is
	come. And he said, Where unto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or
	with what comparison shall we compare it? It is like a grain of
	mustard seed, which, when it is sewn in the earth, is less than all
	the seeds that be in the earth: Hut when it is sown, it groweth up,

	so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.&quot;

	section of the Muslims translates this verse, thus: &quot;Allah has
	promised forgiveness and a great reward to those from among these
	people who have believed and done good works.&quot; Thus, they
	invent a way to vilify and slander the Companions, and claim that
	according to this verse many people among the Companions were not
	believers and righteous. But this commentary goes against vv. 4, 5,
	18 and 26 of this very Sarah, and does not even accord with the
	initial sentences of this verse itself. In vv. 4-5, Allah has made
	mention of sending down sakinat (tranquillity) and of effecting
	increase in the Faith of all those Companions who were present with
	the Holy Prophet at Hudaibiyah, and given them without any exception
	the good news of admission into Paradise. In verse 18, Allah has
	expressed His good pleasure for all those who took the pledge to the
	Holy Prophet, and in this also there is no exception. In verse 26
	also Allah has used the word mu 'minin (believers) for all the
	Companions, has made mention of sending down His sakinat to there,
	and obliged them to be righteous and pious, for they were most
	worthy and deserving of all mankind. Here also it was not said that
	the news was being given only abut those who were believers among
	them. Then in the initial sentences also of this verse itself the
	characteristics mentioned arc of all those people who were with the
	Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings).
	The words are to the effect that all the people who are with him
	have this and this quality and characteristic. After this, suddenly
	in the last sentence there could be no excuse to say that some of
	them were the believers and others were not.
