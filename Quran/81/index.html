the first six verses the first stage of the Resurrection has been

the mountains will be uprooted and will disperse, the people will
become heedless of their dearest possessions, the beasts of the
jungle will be stupefied and will gather together, and the seas will
boil up. Then in the next seven verses the second stage has been
described when the souls will be reunited with the bodies, the
records will be laid open, the people will be called to account for
their crimes, the heavens will be unveiled, and Hell and Heaven will
be brought into full view. After depicting the Hereafter thus, man

	is a matchless metaphor for causing the sun to lose its light.
	Takwir means to fold up; hence takwir al- `amamah for folding up the
	turban on the head. Here, the light which radiates from the sun and
	spreads throughout the solar system has been likened to the turban
	and it has been said that on the Resurrection Day the turban will be

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>This
	was by far the best way of giving an idea of the severities and
	horrors of Resurrection to the Arabs. Before the buses and trucks of
	the present day there was nothing more precious for the Arabs than
	the she-camel just about to give birth to her young. In this state
	she was most sedulously looked after and cared for, so that she is
	not lost, stolen, or harmed in any way. The people's becoming
	heedless of such she-camels, in fact, meant that at that time they
	would be so stunned as to become unmindful of their most precious

	word sujjirat as used in the original in passive voice from tasjir
	in the past tense. Tasjir means to kindle fire in the oven.
	Apparently it seems strange that on the Resurrection Day fire would
	blaze up in the oceans. But if the truth about water is kept in
	view, nothing would seem strange. It is a miracle of God that He
	combined oxygen and hydrogen, one of which helps kindle the fire and
	the other gets kindled of itself and by the combination of both He
	created a substance like water which is used to put out fire. A
	simple manifestation of Allah's power is enough to change this
	composition of water so that the two gases are separated and begin
	to burn and help cause a blaze, which is their basic

	style of this verse reflects an intensity of rage and fury
	inconceivable in common life. The parents who buried their daughters
	alive, would be so contemptible in the-sight of Allah that they
	would not be asked: &quot;Why did you kill the innocent infant?&quot;
	But disregarding them the innocent girl will be asked: &quot;For
	what crime were you slain?&quot; And she will tell her story how
	cruelly she had been treated by her barbarous parents and buried
	alive. Besides, two vast themes have been compressed into this brief
	verse, which though not expressed in words, are reflected by its
	style and tenor. First that in it the Arabs have been made to
	realize what depths of moral depravity they have touched because of
	their ignorance in that they buried their own children alive; yet
	they insist that they would persist in the same ignorance and would
	not accept the reform that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) was
	trying to bring about in their corrupted society. Second, that an
	express argument has been given in it of the necessity and
	inevitability of the Hereafter. The case of the infant girl who was
	buried alive, should be decided and settled justly at some tune, and
	there should necessarily be a time when the cruel people who
	committed this heinous crime, should be called to account for it,
	for there was none in the world to hear the cries of complaint
	raised by the poor soul. This act was looked upon with approval by
	the depraved society; neither the parents felt any remorse for it,
	nor anybody in the family censured them, nor the society took any
	notice of it. Then, should this monstrosity remain wholly unpunished
	in the Kingdom of God? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	barbaric custom of burying the female infants alive had become
	widespread in ancient Arabia for different reasons. One reason was
	economic hardship because of which the people wanted to have fewer
	dependents so that they should not have to bear the burden of
	bringing up many children. Male offspring were brought up in the
	hope that they would later help in earning a living, but the female
	offspring were killed for the fear that they would have to be reared
	till they matured and then given away in marriage. Second, the
	widespread chaos because of which the male children were brought up
	in order to have more and more helpers and supporters; but daughters
	were killed because in tribal wars they had to be protected instead
	of being useful in any way for defense. Third, another aspect of the
	common chaos also was that when the hostile tribes raided each other
	and captured girls they would either keep them as slave-girls or
	sell them to others. For these reasons the practice that had become
	common in Arabia was that at childbirth a pit was kept dug out ready
	for use by the woman so that if a girl was born, she was immediately
	cast into it and buried alive. And if sometimes the mother was not
	inclined to act thus, or the people of the family disapproved of it,
	the father would rear her for some time half-heartedly, and then
	finding time would take her to the desert to be buried alive. This
	tyranny and hard-heartedness was once described by a person before
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) himself. According to a Hadith
	related in the first chapter of Sunan Darimi, a man came to the Holy
	Prophet and related this incident of his pre-Islamic days of
	ignorance: &quot;I had a daughter who was much attached to me. When
	I called her, she would come running to me. One day I called her and
	took her out with me. On the way we came across a well. Holding her
	by the hand I pushed her into the well. Her last words that I heard
	were: Oh father, oh father!!&quot; Hearing this the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) wept and tears started falling from his eyes
	One of those present on the occasion said: O man, you have grieved
	the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet said: Do not stop him, let him
	question about what he feels so strongly now. Then the Holy Prophet
	asked him to narrate his story once again. When he narrated it again
	the Holy Prophet wept so bitterly that his beard became we with
	tears. Then he said to the man: &quot;Allah has forgiven that you
	did in the days of ignorance: now turn to Him in repentance.' 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is not
	correct to think that the people of Arabia had no feeling of the
	baseness of this hideous, inhuman act. Obviously, no society,
	however corrupted it may be, can be utterly devoid of the feeling
	that such tyrannical acts are evil. That is why the Holy Qur'an has
	not dwelt upon the vileness of this act, but has only referred to it
	in awe-inspiring words to the effect: &quot;A time will come when
	the girl who was buried alive, will be asked for what crime she was
	slain?&quot; The history of Arabia also shows that many people in
	the pre-Islamic days of ignorance had a feeling that the practice
	was vile and wicked. According to Tabarani, Sa`sa'ah bin Najiyah
	al-Mujashi`i, grandfather of the poet, Farazdaq, said to the Holy
	Prophet: &quot;O Messenger of Allah, during the days of ignorance I
	have done some good works also among which one is that I saved 360
	girls from being buried alive: I gave two camels each as ransom to
	save their lives. Shall I get any reward for this?&quot; The Holy
	Prophet replied; &quot;Yes, there is a reward for you, and it is
	this that Allah has blessed you with Islam.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As a
	matter of fact, a great blessing of the blessings of Islam is that
	it not only did put an end to this inhuman practice in Arabia but
	even wiped out the concept that the birth of a daughter was in any
	way a calamity, which should be endured unwillingly. On the
	contrary, Islam taught that bringing up daughters, giving them good
	education and enabling them to become good housewives, is an act of
	great merit and virtue. The way the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) changed the common concept of the people in respect of girls
	can be judged from his many sayings which have been reported in the
	Hadith. As for example, we reproduce some of these below: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	person who is put to a test because of the birth of the daughters
	and then he treats them generously, they will become a means of
	rescue for him from Hell.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	one who brought up two girls till they attained their maturity, will
	appear along with me on the Resurrection Day ... Saying this the
	Holy Prophet jointed and raised his fingers. (Muslim). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	one who brought up three daughters, or sisters, taught then good
	manners and treated them with kindness until they became
	self-sufficient. Allah will make Paradise obligatory for him. A man
	asked: what about two, O Messenger of Allah? The Holy Prophet
	replied: the same for two.&quot; Ibn `Abbas, the reporter of the
	Hadith, says: &quot;Had the people at that time asked in respect of
	one daughter, the Holy Prophet would have also given the same reply
	about her. &quot; (Sharh as-Sunnh). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	one who has a daughter born to him and he does not bury her alive,
	nor keeps her in disgrace, nor prefers his son to her, Allah will
	admit him to Paradise.&quot; (Abu Da'ud). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
