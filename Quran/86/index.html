style of its subject matter resembles that of the earliest Surahs

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First
of all, the stars of the heavens have been cited as an evidence that
there is nothing in the universe which may continue to exist and
survive without guardian over it. Then man has been asked to consider
his own self as to how he has been brought into existence from a mere
sperm drop and shaped into a living human being. Then it has been
said that the God, Who has so brought him into existence, has
certainly the power to create him once again, and this resurrection
will be for the purpose to subject to scrutiny all the secrets of man
which remained hidden in the world. At that time, man will neither be
able to escape the consequences of his deeds by his own power, nor
will anyone else come to his rescue. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, it has been pointed out that just as the falling of rain
from the sky and the sprouting of plants and crops from the earth is
no child's play but a serious task, so also the truths expressed in
the Qur'an are no jest but a firm and unchangeable reality. The
disbelievers are involved in the misunderstanding that their plans
and devices will defeat the invitation of the Qur'an, but they do not
know that Allah too is devising a plan which will bring to naught all
their scheming and planning. Than in one sentence the discourse has
been summed up, with a word of consolation to the Holy Prophet (upon
whom be peace) and a tacit warning to the disbelievers, saying: &quot;Have
patience for a while: let the disbelievers do their worst. Before
long they will themselves realize whether they have been able to
defeat the Qur'an by their scheming or the Qur'an has dominated them
in the very place where they are exerting their utmost to defeat it.&quot;
