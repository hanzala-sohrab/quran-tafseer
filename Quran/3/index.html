that Muhammad (Allah's peace be, upon him) taught the same right way
of life that had been preached by their own Prophets; that it alone
was the Right Way, the way of Allah; hence any deviation from it will
be wrong even according to their own Scriptures. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

preceding Surah. The Muslims have been warned to learn a lesson from
the religious and moral degeneration of the former communities and to
refrain from treading in their footsteps. Instructions have also been
given about the reformative work they had to perform. Besides this,
they have been taught how to deal with the people of the Book and the
hypocrites who were putting different kinds of hindrances in the way
of Allah. Above all, they have been warned to guard against those
weaknesses which had come to the surface in the Battle Uhd. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	Believers had met with all sorts of trials and hardships about which
	they had been forewarned in Al-Baqarah. Though they had come out
	victorious in the Battle of Badr, they were not out of danger yet.
	Their victory had aroused the enmity of all those powers in Arabia
	which were opposed to the Islamic Movement. Signs of threatening
	storms had begun to appear on all sides and the Muslims were in a
	perpetual state of fear and anxiety. It looked as if the whole
	Arabian world around the tiny state of Al-Madinah - which was no
	more than a village state at that time -- was bent upon blotting out
	its very existence. This state of war was also adversely affecting
	its economy, which had already been badly disturbed by the influx of
	the Muslim refugees from Makkah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<LI><P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
	there was the disturbing problem of the Jewish clans who lived in
	the suburbs of Al-Madinah. They were discarding the treaties of
	alliance they had made with the Holy Prophet after his migration
	from Makkah. So much so that on the occasion of the Battle of Badr,
	these people of the Book sympathized with the evil aims of the
	idolaters, in spite of the fact that their fundamental articles of
	the Faith - Oneness of Allah, Prophethood, Life-after- death -- were
	the same as those of the Muslims. After the Battle of Badr, they
	openly began to incite the Quraish and other Arab clans to wreak
	their vengeance on the Muslims. Thus those Jewish clans set aside
	their centuries-old friendly and neighborly relations with the
	people of Al-Madinah. At last when their mischievous actions and
	breaches of treaties became unbearable, the Holy Prophet attacked
	the Bani- Qainu-qa'a, the most mischievous of all the other Jewish
	clans who had conspired with the hypocrites of Al-Madinah and the
	idolatrous Arab clans to encircle the Believers on all sides. The
	magnitude of the peril might be judged from the fact that even the
	life of the Holy Prophet himself was always in danger. Therefore his
	Companions slept in their armors during that period and kept watch
	at night to guard against any sudden attack, and whenever the Holy
	Prophet happened to be out of sight even for a short while, they
	would at once set out in search of him. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
	incitement by the Jews added fuel to the fire which was burning in
	the hearts of the Quraish and they began to make preparations to
	avenge the defeat they had suffered at Bad. A year after this an
	army of 3,000 strong marched out of Makkah to invade Al-Madinah and
	a battle took place at the foot of Mount Uhd. The Holy Prophet came
	out of Al-Madinah with one thousand men to meet the enemy. While
	they were marching to the battle-field, three hundred hypocrites
	deserted the army and returned to Al- Madinah, but there still
	remained a small band of hypocrites among the seven hundred who
	accompanied the Holy Prophet. They played their part and did their
	worst to create mischief and chaos in the ranks of the Believers
	during the Battle. This was the first clear indication of the fact
	that within the fold of the Muslim Community there was quite a large
	number of saboteurs who were always ready to conspire with the
	external enemies to harm their own brethren. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Though
	the devices of the hypocrites had played a great part in the
	set-back at Uhd, the weaknesses of the Muslims themselves
	contributed no less to it. And it was but natural that the Muslims
	should show signs of moral weakness for they were a new community
	which had only recently been formed on a new ideology and had not as
	yet got a thorough moral training. Naturally in this second hard
	test of their physical and moral strength, some weaknesses came to
	the surface. That is why a detailed review of the Battle of Uhd was
	needed to warn the Muslims of their shortcomings and to issue
	instructions for their reform. It should also be noted that this
	review of the Battle is quite different from the reviews that are
	usually made by generals on similar occasions. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	Gospel (Injil) for the people generally take the Pentateuch (the
	first five books of the Old Testament) for the Torah, and the
	Gospels (the first four books of the New Testament) for the Injil.
	The misconception creates doubts about Revelation itself and a
	question arises, &quot;Are these books really the Word of God? And
	does the Holy Qur'an really confirm all their contents&quot;? As a
	matter of fact, the Torah, which the Qur'an confirms, is not the
	Pentateuch but is contained in it, and the Injil is not &quot;the
	four Gospels&quot; but is widen these books. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Taurat consists of those commandments and injunctions which were
	given to Prophet Moses (Allah's peace be upon him) during his
	Prophethood, which lasted for about forty years. Of these were the
	Ten commandments which were inscribed on stone tablets and delivered
	to Moses on Mount Tur: as regards the remaining Commandments and
	injunctions he himself had put down in writing. Then he handed one
	copy of the Torah to each of the twelve tribes of Israel for
	guidance. One copy was entrusted to the Levites for safe custody,
	which along with the stone tablets, was deposited in the Ark. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">That
	Taurat remained quite sate and sound as an entire book up to the
	first destruction of Jerusalem. But, by and by, the Israelites grew
	so indifferent to and negligent and unmindful of it that when the
	Temple of Solomon was under repair during the reign of Joshiah,
	Hilkiah. the high Priest came across it by chance but did not know
	that it was the Torah; he thought it was only a Law book and passed
	it on to the Royal Scribe as a curio. The latter presented it to
	king Joshiah who tore his clothes and ordered Hilkiah and others to
	consult the Eternal about the terms of the book. (2 Kings, 22:
	8-13). Such was the condition of the Israelites when Nebuchadnezzar
	sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple, and they lost for ever
	even the very few copies of the Torah which had long lain neglected
	in some forgotten niches. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The Old
	Testament was compiled by Ezra, when the Israelites returned home to
	Jerusalem after their captivity in Babylon and built the Temple
	anew. Ezra gathered together some prominent men of his community,
	and with their help compiled the whole history of Israel which now
	comprises the first 17 books of the Bible. Of these Exodus,
	Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronorny tell the life history of Prophet
	Moses and include those verses of the real Taurat which became
	available to Ezra and his assistants, who incorporated them in those
	books at appropriate places in the chronological order of their
	revelation. Thus it is obvious that the Pentateuch as a whole is not
	the Taurat but includes it. The real Taurat comprises those verses
	which are scattered all over the life story of Prophet Moses, and it
	is not difficult even today to locate and recognize them. Such
	portions where the author says, &quot;God said to Moses,&quot; or
	Moses said, The Lord your God says,&quot; the Taurat begins, and
	where the narrative of the life story is resumed, there that part of
	the Taurat ends. At those places the author of the Bible has
	inserted certain things by way of explanation or commentary, and it
	is here that the ordinary reader fails to distinguish the real
	Taurat from the commentary. However, those who have an insight into
	the nature of Divine Scriptures, can distinguish, to some degree of
	exactness, the explanatory. notes from the revealed verses. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to the Qur'an, only such scattered portions in the Pentateuch are
	the Taurat and it confirms them alone. And this can be testified by
	putting together these verses and comparing them with the Qur'an.
	Here and there one might come across a minor difference in their
	details, but one cannot find even the slightest difference between
	the fundamental teachings of the two. Even today one can see clearly
	that both the Scriptures have come from the same source. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Likewise,
	the Injil is the name of those inspired discourses and sayings which
	Jesus (Allah's peace be upon him) uttered as a prophet during the
	last couple of years of his life. We have no means now of
	ascertaining whether these pious utterances were recorded and
	compiled during the lifetime of Jesus. In the introduction to his
	translation of the Bible, Moffat says, &quot;Jesus wrote nothing and
	for a time his immediate disciples felt no impulse to write any
	account of him. The data of the historical Jesus, therefore is based
	on the vivid recollections and traditions of the primitive
	Palestinian disciples. How soon their materials took written shape
	we cannot tell, but at least one written record of them was probably
	in existence by about A.D.50.&quot; Anyhow, when, long after his
	recall, the stories of Jesus were compiled in the shape of tour
	Gospels, (the period of the composition of Mark, the tirst to be
	composed was 65-75 A.D.), some of his written or inspired sayings
	were also inserted at appropriate places in the historical sketches.
	Thus it is obvious that the first tour Gospels are not the Injil,
	the discourses and sayings of Jesus, but they contain it. We have no
	means of recognizing thetas from the works of the authors except
	this: Wherever the authors say &quot;Jesus said so or taught so and
	so,&quot; there the Injil begins and where they resume the
	narration, there it ends. According to the Qur'an, only such
	portions are the Injil and these alone are condensed by it. If these
	portions are compiled together and compared with the Qur'an, one
	will tied no serious difference between the two, and, if somewhere a
	trivial difference appears, it can be removed very easily with
	unbiased thinking.

	are those verses in which there is a possibility of more than one
	meaning. Their object is to give a certain minimum knowledge about
	the universe, its beginning and end, the position of man therein,
	and such other basic things, for these things are essential for the
	formulation of any system of life. It is obvious that no human
	language possesses words, expressions, idioms etc., to depict
	clearly those supernatural things, which have never yet been grasped
	by human senses, nor seen nor heard nor smelt nor touched nor tasted
	by human beings. That is why such supernatural things have to be
	described in terms of human life. That is why the Qur'an uses
	ambiguous verses in human language which are liable to give rise to
	more than one meaning. Thus it is clear that the main benefit of
	such verses is that they help one approach the Reality and form a
	conception of it. Hence the more one tries to determine their
	precise meanings, the more one gets involved in doubts and
	ambiguities. As a result of this, one will not be able to find the
	Reality but will be led further away from it and cause mischief.
	Therefore those, who seek after the Truth and do not hanker after
	superfluities, rest content with the simple idea of Reality they get
	from the ambiguous verses, which suffices thetas for an
	understanding of the Qur'an; they concentrate their whole attention
	on a fuller comprehension of the verses which are precise in
	meaning. On the other hand, those who love superfluities or seek
	after mischief, spend their tune and energies in giving arbitrary

	by the &quot;woman of `Imran&quot; is meant the &quot;wife of
	`Imran&quot;, then this must be a different 'Imran from the one
	mentioned above in v. 33. In that case one comes to the conclusion
	that the father of Mary was named 'Imran after that ancestor. But if
	by the &quot;woman of `Imran&quot; is meant a woman from the family
	of 'Imran, then it merely shows that Mary's mother was a descendant
	of `Imran. We possess no authentic knowledge of the basis on which
	one opinion may be preferred to the other. Though according to some
	Christian traditions the name of Mary's father was Iaachim, history
	does not say who the father of Mary was and to which family her
	mother belonged. But if the tradition that the mothers of Mary and
	Elisabeth, the mother of John, were cousins be taken as we, (Luke 1:
	36), then the &quot;woman of `Imran&quot; will mean a woman from the
	family of `Imran. The Gospel of Luke (1:5) says that Elisabeth, the
	wife of Zacharias. &quot;was of the daughters of Aaron&quot;, that
	is, 'Imran daughter or woman of `Imran; therefore it is clear that
	there is no anachronism of confounding Miriam, the sister of Aaron,
	with the virgin Mary. It is a common practice to call children by
	the names of their ancestors; so both the explanations are equally
	acceptable. Moreover, it does not make any difference whatsoever, in
	the line of argument adopted here to explain the miraculous birth of
	Jesus, whether 'Imran was really the name of Mary's father or has
	been called so in the ancestral sense.

	to Zacharias' prayer. It, therefore, carries the same sense here.
	Moreover, the whole context here corroborates the story that Mary
	was given the glad tidings of the birth of a son without any sexual
	intercourse, and the birth of Christ, in actual fact, took place in
	that unusual way. If a son was to be born to her in the normal known
	way, and if the event of the birth of Jesus had taker. place in a
	natural way, then the whole discourse starting from verse 33 and
	ending with verse 63 would become absolutely pointless. Not only
	that but all other references to the unusual birth of Jesus in the
	Qur'an would lose their significance and meaning. The Christians had
	made Jesus the Son of God and worthy of worship simply because of
	his unusual birth without a father and the Jews had accused Mary
	because they had witnessed that she had given birth to a child,
	though she was not married. Had it been otherwise, then the two
	groups could have been told plainly that the girl was married to
	such and such a man and that Jesus was from his seed. In that case,

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote48sym" HREF="#sdfootnote48anc">48</A>This
	shows that like all other Prophets, Jesus also based his teachings
	on the following three fundamentals: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	Supreme Authority to which mankind should submit and surrender
	exclusively belongs to Allah and all the social and moral systems
	should be built entirely on it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) Being
	a representative of the same Pararmount Power, a prophet must be
	obeyed unconditionally. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) Allah
	alone is entitled to prescribe laws and regulations for making
	things lawful or unlawful, pure and impure; consequently all laws
	imposed by others must be abolished. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus it
	is clear that Jesus, Moses, Muhammad and all other Prophets (Allah's
	peace be upon them all) had one and the same mission. Those people
	who aver that different Prophets were sent with different missions
	and to fulfil different aims, are gravely mistaken. Anyone, who is
	delegated by the Absolute Master of the Universe to His subjects,
	cannot have any other mission than to prevent the people, from
	becoming disobedient to and independent of Him, and to forbid them
	to set others to rank with Allah as partners in His Authority in any
	way. For, they are sent to invite the people to surrender and submit
	and be loyal to the Almighty God and worship Him alone. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is a
	pity that the existing Gospels do not present the mission of Jesus
	so precisely and clearly as it has been presented above in the Holy
	Qur'an. Nevertheless all the three basic things mentioned above are
	found scattered over in these Books. For instance, the fact that
	Jesus believed exclusively in the worship of Allah is clear from the
	following: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) &quot;Thou
	shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only shalt thou serve.&quot;
	(Matthew 4: 10). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) Not
	only did he believe in this, but also made it the ultimate aim of
	all his activities and strove to make the people of the earth to
	submit to the revealed Law of Allah just as the whole universe
	submits to His physical Law. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Thy
	kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.&quot;
	(Matthew 6 :10). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then the
	fact that Jesus always presented himself as a prophet and as a
	representative of the Kingdom of Heaven, and always invited the
	people to follow him in that capacity alone, is supported by a
	number of his sayings. When he started his mission in his native
	place, Nazareth, the people of his own town and his own kinsfolk
	rose against him and according to an agreed tradition of Matthew,
	Mark and Luke, he said: &quot;No prophet is accepted in his own
	country&quot;. And when his enemies were conspiring at Jerusalem to
	kill him and the people advised him to go to somewhere else, he
	replied: &quot;It cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.&quot;
	(Luke 13: 33). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When he
	was entering Jerusalem for the last time, his disciples began to
	utter in a loud voice: &quot;Blessed be the King that cometh in the
	name of the Lord.&quot; At this the Pharisees felt offended and
	asked him to silence his disciples. He replied: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;I
	tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would
	inunediately cry out.&quot; (Luke 19: 38-40). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On
	another occasion he said: &quot;Come unto me, all ye that labour and
	are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and
	learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart ..... my yoke is easy,
	and my burden is light.&quot; (Matthew 11: 28-30). Moreover the fact
	that Jesus wanted the people to obey the Divine Law rather than
	man-made laws becomes clear from that tradition of Matthew and Mark
	which says that when the Pharisees asked, why his disciples
	transgressed the tradition of the elders and took food without
	washing their hands,. he replied and said, &quot;Well hath Esaias
	prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written. This people
	honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
	Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
	commandments of men. For laying aside the commandments of God, ye
	hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups, and many
	other such like things ye do. And he said unto them, Full well ye
	reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
	For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth
	father or mother, iet him die the death: But ye say, If a man shall
	say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift,
	by whatsoever thou mightest he profited by me; he shall be free. And
	ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;
	Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which
	ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.&quot; (Mark 7:

	literally means &quot;to take and to receive&quot; and &quot;to
	seize the soul&quot; is not its lexical but metaphorical meaning.
	Here it means &quot;to recall from mission.&quot; Allah recalled
	Jesus because the Israelites had rejected him in spite of the clear
	Signs he had brought. They had been disobeying God for centuries
	and, in spite of many a warning and admonition served to them, their
	national character was rapidly deteriorating. They had killed
	several Prophets, one after the other, and had grown so audacious as
	to demand the blood of any good man who ventured to invite them to
	the Right Way. In order to give them the last chance for turning to
	the Truth, God appointed among them two great Prophets, Jesus and
	John (God's peace be upon them), at one and the same time. These
	Prophets came with such clear signs of their appointment from Allah
	that only such people dared reject them as were utterly perverted
	and prejudiced against the Truth and were averse to following the
	Right Way. Nevertheless the Israelites lost their last chance also
	as they not only rejected their invitation but also had the head of
	a great Prophet like John cut off openly at the request of a dancing
	girl. 'And their Pharisees and Jurists conspired and sought to get
	Jesus punished with the death sentence by the Roman Government. Thus
	they had proved themselves to be so obdurate that it was useless to
	give the Israelites any further chance. So Allah recalled His
	Prophet Jesus and inflicted on them a life of disgrace up to the Day
	of Resurrection. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It will
	be useful here to bear in mind the fact that this whole discourse is
	meant to refute and correct the Christian belief in the God-head of
	Jesus. Three main things were responsible for the prevalence of this
	belief among the Christians: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	miraculous birth of Jesus. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) His
	concrete and tangible miracles. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) His
	ascension to heaven about which their Scriptures were explicit. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Qur'an confirmed the first thing and made it plain that the birth of
	Jesus without a father was only a manifestation of the infinite
	powers of Allah. He can create anybody in whatever manner He wills.
	His miraculous birth, therefore, is no reason why he should be made
	a god or a partner in Godhead. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Qur'an also confirms the second thing and even recounts the miracles
	performed by Jesus, but makes it clear that all those miracles were
	performed by him, as a servant of Allah, by His leave and not as an
	independent authority. It is, therefore, wrong to infer that Jesus
	was a partner in Godhead. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the third thing. If the Christian belief in &quot;Ascension&quot;
	had been wholly baseless, it could have been refuted by pointing out
	that the object of their worship, the so-called &quot;Son of God&quot;,
	expired long ago and had become one with dust, and that they could
	see, for their full satisfaction, his grave at such and such a
	place. But the Qur'an does not declare this explicitly. On the other
	hand, it not only uses such words as give at least a vague
	suggestion of his &quot;Ascension&quot;, but also denies that Jesus
	was crucified at all. According to it the one who gave a loud cry at
	his last hour, saying, &quot;Eli&quot; Eli, lama sabachthani?&quot;
	and the one whose picture they carry on the cross, was not Messiah
	at all, because God had recalled to Himself the real Messiah before
	the crucifixion took place. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is
	thus clear that those people who try to prove the death of Jesus
	from these verses, really try to show that God is not able to
	express Himself clearly and unambiguously. (May God protect us from

	main points in the discourse presented before the Christians up to
	here are: First, they have been admonished to realize that their
	belief in the Godhead of Jesus is gravely ill-founded. He was only a
	man who was born in a miraculous way by the will of Allah and given
	the power to perform certain miracles as a clear proof of his
	Prophethood. As regards his &quot;Ascension&quot;, Allah had
	arranged to recall him to Himself before the disbelievers could
	crucify him. In fact, the Master of the Universe has full powers to
	treat any of His servants in any special way He pleases. It is,
	therefore, wrong to infer from the exceptional treatment accorded to
	Jesus that he himself was the Master or the Master's Son or a
	partner in the authority of the Master.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	their attention has been drawn to the fact that Prophet Muhammad
	(Allah's peace be upon him) invites them to the same Truth that had
	been preached by Prophet Jesus (God's peace be upon him) in his own
	time and that the teachings of the two Prophets were basically
	identical.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly,
	the disciples of Jesus believed in and followed the same religion of
	Islam that is being presented in the Qur'an. However the Christians
	of the later age discarded the message of Jesus and digressed from
	the Faith of his disciples.

	pointed out in the above discourse and could not bring any authority
	even from their own Scriptures to justify and support their beliefs
	under discussion. They could not, therefore, assert with full
	conviction that their beliefs conformed to the fact and were not
	false. Besides this, when they observed closely the character and
	the teachings and the works of the Holy Prophet, the majority of the
	members of the deputation were so impressed that they became
	convinced in their hearts of his Prophethood; or at least, they
	could not reject it boldly. That is why they did not accept the
	challenge: &quot;If you really believe in the truth of your creed,
	you should pray with us to Allah and invoke His curse on those who
	say false things about Christ.&quot; The fact that they declined to
	accept the challenge showed plainly to the whole of Arabia that the
	religious leaders and priests of the Christians of Najran who were

	even if one can afford it, becomes a disbeliever in the technical
	sense. It means that the person has adopted the attitude of a
	disbeliever even after his profession of belief in Allah and His
	Prophet. This is obvious because the Commandment to perform Haj has
	not been addressed to the disbelievers but to those who profess to
	be Muslims. A Muslim judge, therefore, will not declare him to be a
	disbeliever and apostate for this reason, as if he had gone out of

	their enemies could do them no harm, if they would show restraint,

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	beginning of Shawwal (A.H. 3), the Quraish attacked Al-Madinah with
	an army of 3,000 men. They not only out-numbered the Muslims but
	were also much better equipped. Besides this, they were filled with
	passion to avenge their defeat at Badr. The Holy Prophet and his
	experienced Companions were of the opinion that they should defend
	Al-Madinah from within the walls, but some young men, who had not
	taken part in the battle of Badr, were so imbued with the spirit of
	martyrdom that they insisted on going out to meet the enemy. At last
	on their persistence, the Holy Prophet decided to go out to fight.
	So he led out an army of 1,000 men but at Shaut, `Abdullah bin
	Ubayy, the ring leader of the hypocrites, deserted him with his 300
	men. Naturally this treacherous act produced much confusion in the
	Muslim army. So much so that two parties, Banu Salmah and Banu
	Harithah, were so disheartened that they began to waver in their
	minds and were about to turn back, but were dissuaded from this by
	those Companions who had remained firm and constant. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then the
	Holy Prophet marched to Mount Uhd with the 700 men left with him
	after the desertion of `Abdullah bin Ubayy. He arrayed his men at
	the foot of the Mount so that the army of the Quraish was in their
	front and Mount Uhd at their back. Thus the only vulnerable point
	was a pass on one side, where he posted 50 archers under the command
	of `Abdullah bin Jubair, saying, &quot; to let not any enemy come
	near us and do not leave your posts in any case whatsoever. Even if
	you see birds peck at our flesh, you should not abandon your posts
	at all. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	initial stage of the battle, the Muslim army had the upper hand and
	succeeded in creating great confusion in the army of the enemy. But
	instead, of pursuing this initial success to the final victory, they
	were so lured by their greed for booty that they began to loot the
	spoils. When the archers, who were guarding the pass, saw their
	comrades plundering the fleeing enemy, they also deserted their
	posts in order to join the looters. In vain did Hadrat `Abdullah bin
	Jubair remind them of the strict command of the Holy Prophet to
	dissuade them from this, but only a few of them listened to him.
	Khalid bin Walid, who was commanding the cavalry of the enemy, made
	full use of this opportune moment. He rode round the Mount and
	attacked the Muslims from behind through the pass. Hadrat `Abdullah
	. bin Jubair did his best to defend it with the few men left with
	him, but in vain, and Khalid fell upon the Muslims who were engaged
	in the plunder of spoils. They were so overwhelmed by this sudden
	attack from behind that they took to their heels in confusion. To
	add to their misery, the Quraish who were in flight before them also
	turned back to attack them from the front. This turned the scale of
	the battle against the Muslims who were put to rout by this
	unexpected situation. Still there were some brave Muslims who stood
	firmly in the battle-field. But then a rumour started that the Holy
	Prophet had been martyred, and his Companions were so stunned by
	this rumour that even those who were standing firm in the
	battle-field lost heart and only a dozen or so of the devoted ones
	were left with him. Thus it was about to turn into an utter rout,
	when his Companions heard that, though he was wounded, he was alive.
	Then they again rallied round him and took him to a safe side of the
	Mount. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection it is very important to note the strange thing that
	happened: the Quraish did not make full use of this opportunity but
	marched back to Makkah instead. This is an enigma, for, if they had
	pursued their success to complete victory, nothing would have
	checked them, because the Muslims had been so utterly routed that
	they could not have given them a battle.

	instead of pursuing their initial success to victory, they got

	struck at interest, the root cause of the evils and prohibited it.
	For it is a common experience that those who lend money on interest

	spreading rumours that the Quraish were making great preparations
	for war and collecting such a large army as could defeat any army in
	Arabia. This device of Abu Sufyan succeeded in producing the desired

	the Quraish in combat at Badr, it failed to produce any encouraging
	response. So much so that the Messenger of Allah had to declare
	before the gathered assembly, &quot;I will go to the combat all
	alone, if none else is willing to go.&quot; It was then that 1,500
	devotees volunteered to accompany him, and he reached Badr with
	them. From the other side,Abu Sufyan left Makkah with an army of
	2,000 men. But after two days' journey, he told his men that it did
	not appear to suit them to have a fight that year, and that they
	would come next year for it. Accordingly, he returned to Makkah with
	his men. The Holy Prophet, however, waited for him at Badr for eight
	days. During these days, his Companions did profitable business with
	a trading party. Then he came to know that the disbelievers had gone
