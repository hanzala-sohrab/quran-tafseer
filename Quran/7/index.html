Holy Prophet's life at Makkah, but it cannot be asserted with

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
principal subject of this surah is &quot;invitation to the Divine
Message sent down to Muhammad&quot; (Allah's peace be upon him),
which is couched in a warning. This is because the Messenger had
spent a long time in admonishing the people of Makkah without any
tangible effect on them. Nay, they had turned a deaf ear to his
message and become so obdurate and antagonistic that, in accordance
with the Divine Design, the Messenger was going to be commanded to
leave them and turn to other people,. That is why they are being
admonished to accept the Message but, at the same time, they are
being warned in strong terms of the consequences that followed the
wrong attitude of the former people towards their Messengers. (Now
that the Holy Prophet was going to&quot; migrate from Makkah the
concluding portion of the address has been directed towards the
people of the Book with whom he was going to come into contact. This
meant that the time of migration was coming near and the &quot;invitation&quot;
was going to be extended to mankind in general, and was not to be
confined to his own people in particular as before. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

the course of the address to the Jews, the consequences of their
hypocritical conduct towards Prophethood have also been pointed out
clearly, for they professed to believe in Prophet Moses but in
practice opposed his teachings, disobeyed him and worshiped falsehood
and consequently were afflicted with ignominy and disgrace. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

they should show patience and exercise restraint in answer to the
provocations of their opponents. Above all, they have been advised
that under stress of the excitement of feeling, they should not take
any wrung step that might harm their cause. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

you have no deity other than He. Will you not, then, refrain from

answered, &quot;We clearly see that you are of unsound mind and we

trustworthy well-wisher of yours. Do you think it strange that
admonition from your Lord should come to you through a man among your

remember the wonderful manifestations of Allah's power:<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote52anc" HREF="#sdfootnote52sym"><SUP>52</SUP></A>

Indeed We afflicted Pharaoh's people with several years of famine and
scarcity of food so that they should come to their senses. But they
responded like this: whenever a good time came; they would say, &quot;This
is but our due&quot; and when there was a hard time, they would
ascribe their calamities to Moses and those with him. Whereas, in
fact, their misfortune was in the hand of Allah; but most of them did
not know this. They said to Moses, &quot;We are not going to believe
in you, whatever Sign you may bring to enchant us.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote94anc" HREF="#sdfootnote94sym"><SUP>94</SUP></A>

steeped in crime. Whenever a plague befell them, they would say, &quot;O

promise. Then We took Our vengeance on them and drowned them in the

good and avoid useless discussions with the ignorant people. If Satan
ever excites you to anger, seek refuge in Allah: He is All-Hearing,

	repeated occurrence of scourge in v. 3 is a conclusive proof of the
	fact that people will be called to account in the Hereafter, because
	in this life full punishment is not possible for the crimes
	committed by wicked individuals and communities. Here it comes
	merely to put a stop to their further crimes, just as a criminal at
	large is arrested and deprived of the opportunity for committing
	further iniquities. The real punishment will be in the Hereafter.
	The numerous instances of scourge in human history are a clear proof
	of the fact that man has not been left free to do what he likes.
	There is the Sovereign above him Who allows him to transgress only
	up to a certain limit and before he reaches that limit, administers
	warnings one after the other so that he may give up his wicked ways.
	But if he does not pay heed, then he is all of a sudden overpowered
	by a scourge that puts an end to his nefarious activities. If we
	consider the matter seriously in the light of these inevitable
	occurrences, we will come to the conclusion that the Sovereign of
	the universe has most surely appointed a time for calling to account
	those criminals and doing full justice to them. As the warning in

	Adam by the blowing of His Spirit into it.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Let us

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Just
	recall the time when your Lord said to the angels, 'I am going to
	create a man out of clay of molded mud W hen I perfect it in every

	before hint' . &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is
	very difficult for us to understand the exact nature of the creation
	of the first man, for we cannot comprehend fully how man was made
	from the material of the earth, how he was shaped and perfected and
	how the Spirit was blown into him. However, it is quite clear that
	the story of man's creation as stated in the Qur'an is quite
	different from Darwinism. According to this doctrine, the evolution
	of man has taken place from a non-human and semi-human state by a
	continuous process of elimination, selection and adaptation, and in
	this there is no line of demarcation to denote the end of the
	non-human state and the beginning of the species of `man' as such.
	On the contrary, the Qur'an says that man started his life as man;
	that in the entire history he has absolutely no connection
	whatsoever with any non-human state. Allah created him as man from
	the very first day of his life on the earth and endowed him with
	wisdom and enlightenment from the very start of iris life. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The above
	two points of view of the story of man lead to two opposite
	conceptions in regard to man. The adoption of the Darwinian
	conception reduces man to one of the species of animals: therefore
	all the principles of human life (including the moral principles)
	will be based on the principles governing animal life and any
	animal-like behavior of his will be regarded as natural. Then the
	only difference between human beings and animals will be the ability
	of the former to make use of instruments for the provision of their
	necessities and luxuries. On the contrary, the adoption of the
	Divine conception raises him from the low position of animal to the
	high position of man, His noblest creation. Then he is no longer a
	mere talking animal or a social animal but the vicegerent of Allah
	on this earth. Then what will distinguish him from all other
	creatures will not be his faculty of speech and his social life, but
	his moral responsibilities and the trust of the power delegated to
	him by Allah and his accountability for these to Him. This will
	change man's entire outlook about his life on this earth and will
	demand a different philosophy of life and system of morality, law
	and civilization. Then man will, of his own accord, look upwards in
	search of the principles of life and not downwards. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider an objection to the Divine conception of man howsoever
	high sounding this may be from the moral and psychological points of
	view: how can we reject the scientific Darwinian conception merely
	on this account? In answer to this, we put a counter question: has
	the Darwinian theory of the `Origin of Species' been scientifically
	proved? Only those people who have a cursory knowledge of science
	may be suffering from this misunderstanding that the theory of
	evolution has been scientifically proved to be true, but the
	majority of the scientists know that it is merely a theory in spite
	of its high-sounding technical terms, and that the arguments in
	favor of this are not conclusive, but merely hypothetical. The most
	that can be said in this connection is that both the theories of the
	creation of the species may be equally possible. Their creation
	might have taken place according to the Darwinian theory of
	evolution, or each of the species might have been brought into
	existence individually.&nbsp;

	(2) The sex instinct is the greatest weakness of the human race.
	That is catty Satan selected this weak spot for his attack on the
	adversary and devised the scheme to strike at their modesty.
	Therefore, the first step he took in this direction was to expose
	their nakedness to them so as to open the door of indecency before
	them and beguile them into sexuality. Even to this day, Satan and

	(4) Man has a great natural yearning for a higher position than the

	succeeded in beguiling them by offering to make them angels or

	(5) The Qur'an refutes the commonly known version that Satan first

	beguiled both of them and both of them were deceived. Though the
	difference between. the two versions appears to be trivial, yet a
	careful appraisal of the two will show that they have far-reaching
	implications. The first version played a great part in degrading
	woman morally, legally and socially, whereas the Quranic version has
	helped raise the status of woman to a high level.

	(6) This story makes it, quite clear that whenever man disobeys
	Allah, he is exposed sooner or later. The nakedness of Adam and Eve
	became visible because they disobeyed the command of Allah, and not
	because of any inherent quality of the forbidden tree: At first
	Allah had made His own special arrangement to cover their nakedness,
	but when they disobeyed Him by eating the forbidden fruit, He undid
	that arrangement and they were left to themselves to cover
	themselves in their own way, if they so desired. And if they had no
	intention of covering themselves, or if they did not do anything in
	this connection, Allah did not care at all about the condition in
	which they moved about. This meant to show that Allah would help
	them only if they remained obedient to Him. As soon as they would
	transgress the bounds of His obedience, He would withdraw His
	protection and leave them to do whatever they liked. The Holy
	Prophet also stated the same thing in several Traditions. He used to
	pray, &quot;O my Allah. I expect Mercy from Thee: so do not leave me
	to myself even for a moment&quot; .</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.2in">
	(7) In his conflict with man, Satan wanted to prove that man was not
	superior to him in any way. So he beguiled him to eat the forbidden
	fruit. Though Satan was successful in beguiling him into disobeying
	his Lord, yet on the whole man proved his moral. superiority over
	Satan. (a) Satan exhibited pride by claiming to be superior to man,
	but man did not put up such a claim. (b) Satan disobeyed Allah
	solely because of his pride without any external temptation. On the
	contrary, man did not commit disobedience because he intended it,
	but he was beguiled into it by Satan, who approached in the guise of
	a well-wisher. Even then, he was misled because he imagined that he
	was going towards a higher position. (c) When Satan was warned of
	his sin, he did not confess it nor return to the way of obedience,
	but became all the more obdurate. On the contrary, when man was
	warned of his sin, he did not show obduracy, nor arrogance; but felt
	ashamed and sorry; he confessed it, turned to the way of obedience
	to his Lord and begged His forgiveness in order to seek His
	blessing. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-left: 0in; text-indent: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.2in">
	(8) This story has been related here mainly to teach the lesson that
	the right course for the offspring of Adam is to follow His way and
	not that of Satan. The Satan's way has been clearly made distinct
	from Adam's way. It is to turn away from Allah's obedience and to
	adopt the way of rebellion against Him and to persist in it with
	pride in spite of warning, and to beguile into disobedience those
	who are treading the path of obedience. Therefore the Right Way for
	man is to fight against satanic deceptions and to understand and
	counteract his cunning devices and to be ever on the guard to
	protect himself from his evil designs, and to repent, if, in spite
	of all his precautions; he sometimes falls a victim to Satan and
	disobeys his Allah. He should, then, confess it, feel sorry for it
	and be ashamed of it and turn to Allah and make amends for it.

	It also meant to warn the people who were opposing the Holy Prophet,

	have made the satans from among the jinns and mankind your patrons
	and that you are persisting in your error, in spite of repeated
	warnings, shows that you have fallen a victim to your open and
	permanent enemy. As you are going to be utterly ruined by him and
	meeting with the same consequences that are in store for Satan, if
	you are not your own enemies, and if you have any common-sense left

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote16sym" HREF="#sdfootnote16anc">16</A>This
	passage brings out clearly the following facts about clothing: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	need of clothing has not been artificially created in man, but it is
	an important urge of human nature. That is why Allah has not created
	a natural covering for the human body, as He has done in the case of
	all other animals. Instead, He has instilled inherently the feelings
	of modesty and shyness in human nature. Besides this, He has not
	made his sex organs as merely sex organs, but has also made them
	shameful organs, which, by his very nature, he does not like to
	expose before others. Moreover, He has not given man any ready-made
	covering for hiding the shameful parts, but has ingrained in the
	human nature that man should hide them with a clothing. This is what
	v. 26 implies. Allah has inspired man with the urge to hide the
	shameful parts of the body. Therefore man should understand the
	nature of this inspired urge and make clothing for himself from the
	material provided by Him. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	fact that in v. 26 the covering of the shameful parts precedes the
	protecting and decorating of the body, is a clear proof that more
	importance has been attached to the moral than the physical function
	of clothing. Thus it is obvious that the human nature is quite
	different from the animal nature. That is why Nature has made
	provision for the protection and decoration of the body of the
	animals, but has ingrained no urge in them for the covering of their
	shameful parts. But when the human beings discarded the Guidance of
	Allah and began to follow the guidance of Satan, they reversed the
	above order as if to say, &quot;Your clothing is merely to protect
	and decorate your bodies just as the skins cover the bodies of the
	animals. As regards the covering of the shameful parts, garments
	have absolutely no importance, for these are merely sex organs and
	not shameful organs.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	garments should not only be the means of covering the shameful parts
	and of protection and decoration but should also enable man to
	attain piety. The dress should, therefore, be such as to conceal
	those parts of the body that should be hidden from others; it should
	neither be too expensive nor too poor with regard to the position of
	the wearers; it should not smack of haughtiness nor arrogance nor
	hypocrisy. Moreover, the garment of piety demands that the male
	should not wear the female dress and vice versa, and that the
	Muslims should not imitate blindly the non-Muslims in dress. It is
	obvious that only those who believe in the Guidance of Allah and
	follow it, can attain the desired standard of the garment of piety.
	But those who discard the Guidance of God and make satans their
	guides, are misled by them into one error or the other in regard to
	clothing. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4)
	Clothing is one of Allah's many Signs which are spread all over the
	world and which lead men to the recognition of the Reality, provided
	that one sincerely seeks it. If one seriously considers the
	above-mentioned three facts about clothing, one can easily
	understand how clothing is an important Sign of Allah.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Though the Arabs practiced nudism in the performance of certain

	they practiced it because this custom had been enjoined by Allah.
	This claim was based on the wrong notion that their religion was
	from Allah. But the Qur'an refutes their claim by arguing like this:
	&quot;You yourselves consider nudism to be an indecent thing.
	Therefore your claim that Allah has enjoined the practice of nudism
	is absolutely false. As a corollary to this, if this indecent custom

	were prompted and influenced by these. At first he himself catches
	the infection of a venereal disease and then communicates it to his
	own generation and to countless successive generations: he causes
	illegitimate births and then throws the burden of nourishment on
	others and makes them unlawful inheritors at the expense of the
	lawful inheritors, and the evil results of this injustice may
	continue to influence countless generations. Moreover, he seduces
	some innocent girl and induces her to surrender herself to sexual
	immorality, and then she, in her turn, spreads the evil to others
	and causes the ruin of countless families. Then he sets a bad
	example for his own children, his relatives and his friends and for
	the other people of his society and becomes a cause of the moral
	ruin of many persons, who, in their turn, leave the evil heritage,
	with all its evil influences on the countless succeeding

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Every

	misunderstandings of those who regard this worldly life to be quite
	sufficient for retribution, and also of those who believe that this
	purpose is achieved by the process of the transmigration of souls.
	As a matter of fact, neither of the groups has fully grasped the
	extent, the effects and the consequences of human acts, nor the full
	requirements of just retribution. Obviously it is not possible today
	to punish here the countless generations, which contributed to the
	good or bad acts of a person during his life in this world. Moreover
	the effects of his good or bad acts do not cease with his death, but
	will continue through the countless centuries and will go on
	influencing the lives of countless people after him. Justice
	requires that these should he credited to his account as long as the
	effects last. Therefore the requital of justice is impossible in
	this worldly life, when even the smallest part of the effects of
	Iris acts has not yet appeared. Then there are not enough means for
	awarding fully the rewards or the punishments for the acts of a man
	in the limited life of this world and its limited means. Just
	imagine the extent of the guilt of a man who kindles the fire of a
	World War and destroys and ruins the lives of millions of people and
	leaves a legacy of evil that will continue to influence the lives of
	billions of people for centuries. Can any punishment in this world,
	physical or moral, or spiritual, however severe that may be, fully
	meet the requirements of justice? Or can any reward in this world,
	however great, fully recompense a man for his lifelong work for the
	good of humanity, which goes on benefiting millions of people for
	thousands of years? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Anyone,
	who will consider the problem of retribution from this point of
	view, will come to the inevitable conclusion that for the requital
	of full justice, there should be another world, where all the
	generations should be mustered together with their accounts: then
	there should be an all-knowing and all-aware judge to administer
	justice and there should also be human beings with eternal lives to
	receive the reward or punishment, as the case may be, and all kinds
	of means for the dispensation of justice as well. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This way
	of thinking also helps expose the basic error of the doctrine of
	transmigration, which has led its advocates to believe in the
	passage of souls after death into other bodies according to their
	merits or demerits. This is because they have not been able to grasp
	the fact that for the retribution of the acts of this short worldly
	life, a thousand times longer life is required. It is thus obvious
	that another reborn life of the same length in this world will not
	help solve the problem of retribution because it is quite
	insufficient for the purpose. On the contrary, this will make it all
	the more complex, for the circle of transmigration will go on
	multiplying such acts-good or bad-and increasing their effects more
	and more in an endless chain. Thus, according to the doctrine of
	transmigration, the account of person will remain unsettled for
	ever. &nbsp;

	is very difficult for us to comprehend the nature of &quot;He sat
	upon the Throne&quot;. It is just possible that after the creation
	of the universe, He fixed some place as the center of His limitless
	Kingdom, which may have been called &quot;The Throne,&quot; from
	where He is showering His blessings on the whole universe and it is
	also possible that the Arabic word &quot;Al- 'Arsh&quot; &quot; may
	have been used figuratively to express His Sovereignty and &quot;seating
	Himself on the Throne&quot; may mean &quot;the taking of the reins
	of His Kingdom in His hands&quot; . Anywise, whatever be the details
	of the Text, the Qur'an mentions this to impress the fact that Allah
	is not only the Creator of the universe but also its Sovereign as
	well as Ruler, that after its creation He has not cut off all
	connections with it and has not become disinterested in its affairs,
	but is practically governing each and every minute part of it; all
	the powers of Sovereignty are, in fact, in His hands; that
	everything is under His Command and is obedient to Him, and the
	destinies of everyone and everything are permanently in His hands.
	In this way the Qur'an cuts across the basic misunderstanding that
	gives rise to the errors like shirk and rebellion against Him. The
	creed that God has nothing to do with the affairs of the universe,
	inevitably leads to the belief that someone else is the maker or

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, it is worth while to consider the use of words akin to
	&quot;kingdom&quot; and &quot;kingship&quot;, which the Qur'an
	usually employs to express the relation between Allah and man.
	Though it is dune obvious that the Qur'an has employed such words,
	technical terms, figures of speech and a style as may be within the
	comprehension of human beings, yet some critics with perverted minds
	have inferred from this use the strange conclusion that this Book is
	the invention of Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him). The line of
	their argument is this: &quot;The frequent use of the words like
	`king' shows that the 'author' of the Qur'an was irresistibly
	influenced by the system of kingship that was prevalent all around
	him during the period when this Book was composed; therefore its
	author cannot be Allah, Who knows that there can be no comparison
	between Him and a king, etc., etc.&quot; Obviously, this argument is
	very flimsy. The conception of the Sovereign of the earth and the
	heavens put forward in the Qur'an clearly shows that in contrast to
	the mortal weak kings of this world, having only a limited authority
	for a limited period, the King, Allah, is Eternal, All-Powerful,
	having the supreme Authority, above all others and for all times.
	This conception of the Sovereignty of `King' Allah falsifies the
	very basis of the theory of the critics, for no human king can fit
	in the conception of the `King' laid down in the Qur'an. For in this
	conception there is no scope for anyone to claim or assume powers of
	sovereignty like the King, because it requires that man should
	acknowledge Allah alone as the sole object of worship in the

	adopts the guidance of others instead for the building up of his
	morality, society and culture. As this creates disorder and gives
	birth to many other kinds of disorder, the Qur'an aims at its
	eradication. At the same time it warns that disorder is not inherent
	in the system of the world so that it may be replaced by order. But
	it so happens that disorder over-whelms the order that was set in
	it, as a result of man's ignorance and rebellion. In other words,
	man did not start his life on the earth in ignorance, barbarism,
	shirk, rebellion and moral disorder, and then reforms were
	introduced afterwards to remove them by degrees. The fact is that he
	started life in peace and order, which was corrupted afterwards by
	the follies and mischiefs of the evil-doers. Then Allah sent His
	Messengers to eradicate that disorder and to set right the system of

	reformed by degrees. In contrast to this, the Qur'an declares that
	Allah settled man on the earth in full light and started his life
	with a system based on peace and order. Then afterwards man himself
	repeatedly followed the guidance of Satan and went into darkness and
	corrupted the original right and orderly system. Then Allah sent His
	Messengers over and over again to invite the people to come out of

	should be noted here that the allegorical use of rain and its
	blessings etc. does not only aim to describe the powers of Allah and
	to give a proof of the life-after-death (though that has been
	mentioned incidentally). Its main object is to present Prophethood
	and its blessings, as also how it helps to distinguish good from
	bad, pure from impure. The coming of the Messenger and the sending
	down of the Guidance and the teachings have been likened to the
	winds laden with clouds and the life-giving rainfall. Just as the
	rainfall brings back to life the dead soil, which begins to bring
	forth the treasures of life, so the teachings of the Prophet and his
	guidance bring back to life the dead humanity, which begins to pour
	out the treasures of goodness. Further on, the allegory points out
	that all these blessings profit only that soil which is
	intrinsically rich and fertile, and is only waiting for rainfall to
	bring forth its treasures. In the same way, only those people can
	benefit from the blessings of the guidance and teachings of the
	Messengers, who had the required capability but could not develop
	their latent qualities for lack of right guidance. As regards the
	mischievous and impure people, they are incapable of benefiting from
	the blessings of Prophethood for they are just like the bad soil,
	which brings forth only useless thorny bushes, if rain falls on it.
	That is why all their hidden mischiefs come into full play at the
	coming of the Messenger. The lesson derived from this allegory has
	been illustrated by citing a series of historical events in the
	succeeding passages, and it has been shown that on the coming of

	first of the historical events referred to in E.N. 46, is being
	related here. According to the Qur'an, Prophet Noah was sent to his
	people, who were the first to corrupt the Right Way of life followed
	by Adam (Allah's peace be upon him) and taught by him to his
	descendants. We learn from the brief hints in the Qur'an and the
	details in the Bible that the people of Noah lived in the country
	which is now called Iraq. The same is confirmed by the tablets found
	in the archaeological remains of Babel which are older than the
	Bible. They tell a story similar to the one related in the Bible and
	the Qur'an, and fix the place of its occurrence near Mosul.
	Moreover, the traditions that have come down from the most ancient
	times from Kurdistan and Armenia say that the ark of Noah anchored
	at some place in the same region. They also point out to some relics
	connected with the story of Noah near Mt. Ararat and the inhabitants
	of Nakhchiwan claim even today that the town was founded by Prophet
	Noah.

	Europe and America are also similar to it. All this shows that this
	story is connected with the period when all the descendants of Adam
	lived in the same region from where they dispersed all over the

	verse and others, in which the story of Noah has been related, show
	that his people did neither deny the existence of Allah nor were
	they ignorant of it, nor did they deny His worship. But the root
	cause of their deviation was that they were involved in shirk and
	had set up other partners with Allah in His Godhead and regarded
	them worthy of worship along with Him. This basic deviation led them
	to numerous other evils. For instance, this gave birth to a special
	class to represent the false gods they had set up. By and by, this
	class took possession of all the religious, political and economic
	powers of the community and created artificial barriers of high and
	low among people. Consequently, chaos, tyranny and immorality were
	rampant everywhere and humanity sank to the lowest depths of
	degradation, Prophet Noah was sent to reform this state of affairs.
	Accordingly, he exerted his utmost with great wisdom and fortitude
	for a very long time to bring about the desired reform, but that
	corrupt class had cunningly deluded the common people so much that
	all his efforts proved fruitless. When no more hope of their reform
	was left, Prophet Noah prayed to Allah and said, &quot;My Lord, do
	not leave upon the earth even one of these disbelievers for, if Thou
	leave anyone of them alive, he will lead astray Thy servants and
	will give birth only to wicked and ungrateful descendants.&quot;

	Noah (Allah's peace be upon him) and his people was exactly taking
	place at that time between Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) and
	his people. His Message was the same as that of Noah and the

	raised by the chiefs of the people of Noah thousands of years before

	said by Noah. Further on, it has been shown in the stories of the
	Messengers that the attitude of their people towards their Message
	was the same that was being shown by the chiefs of Makkah. Thus, the
	Qur'an impresses on its addressees the fact that in every age, the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote50sym" HREF="#sdfootnote50anc">50</A>The
	brief descriptions of certain events from the mission of Prophets at
	certain places in the Qur'an have given rise to the conjecture that
	the whole thing was finished in a couple of meetings. They think
	that a prophet presented his claim before his people and they raised
	some objections against it. Then the Prophet answered them, but they
	rejected him, and declared the Message to be false. This was
	repeated a couple of times; then God sent down His scourge. This is
	a wrong conjecture made by those who are ignorant of the style of
	the Qur'an. These things arc only parts of the long struggle, for
	the Qur'an does not give all the details of a story at one and the
	same place. In relating some historical event, it confines itself
	only to that part of the story which is directly connected with the
	theme under discussion and leaves out all other details. As an
	illustration, let us cite instances of this from the story of
	Prophet Noah. Here the aim is to warn the people of the consequences
	of the denial and rejection of the Message of the Prophet. So it was
	not necessary to mention the long period during which the Prophet
	continued preaching the Message to his people. But at places where
	the story is related to teach fortitude to Prophet Muhammad and his
	Companions, a special mention has been made of the long period
	during which Prophet Noah went on preaching the Message. This is to
	encourage them that they should not lose heart by seeing no great
	and immediate result of their efforts of a few years but should
	learn a lesson from the story of Prophet Noah, who went on
	performing his mission with fortitude for centuries in very adverse
	circumstances, without losing heart. (Sec XXIX: 14). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Likewise,
	some people become skeptical when they read, over and over again,
	such a thing as this: &quot;We drowned (destroyed) those who denied
	the Message and treated it as false&quot;: they ask, &quot;Why do
	such things not happen now a-days?&quot; They admit that though the
	rise and fall of nations is always taking place in the world, this
	change is of a different nature from the one described in the
	Qur'an, e.g., instant destruction of a nation by an earthquake or
	flood or storm or lightning after due notice by a Prophet. In order
	to remove this doubt, one should understand the difference between
	the case of that community in which a Prophet is born and raised
	from among themselves, and the one where a Prophet is not present in
	person. He conveys Allah's Message directly to them in their own
	language and presents a perfect and excellent model of it in his own
	person in such a convincing way as to leave no excuse whatever for
	them to reject it. Therefore such a community deserves the severest
	punishment on the spot for rejecting the Messenger of Allah after
	such clear Signs. Obviously the case of such a community is
	basically different from the case of that community which does not
	receive the Message directly from the Prophet but received it
	through indirect means. So there is no wonder if such chastisements
	arc not inflicted on the spot now, as they were during the times of
	the Prophets. This is because after the Prophethood of Muhammad, the
	last in the line of prophets (Allah's peace be upon them all), no
	prophet has been sent, nor shall any be sent up to the Last Day.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This does
	not, however, mean that Allah has now totally given up the
	infliction of chastisements. The fact is that even now He sends
	disasters by way of warning or punishment on those communities which
	rebel against Him and deviate into error. But it is a pity that
	people do not turn their attention towards the real cause. Instead
	of looking at these as the consequences of their own evil ways,
	their scientists, their historians and their philosophers, who
	cannot go beyond physical causes, mislead them by ascribing these to
	some physical and historical laws. These so-called scholars do not
	let them turn their attention to the fact that there is Allah above
	them, Who first warns them of their evil ways by inflicting minor
	disasters, and then, if they persist in the wrong ways, He throws
	them into the abyss of destruction.

	Before the revelation of the Qur'an, their stories were very common

	Salih drank water, and told them to drink water only from that well.
	Then he showed them a pass over a hill and said that the she-camel
	used to come through it to the well for drinking water. That pass is

	clear proof&quot;, which has been called &quot;a Sign&quot; in the

	tribe had themselves demanded from Prophet Salih to bring a clear
	Sign of his appointment as Messenger of Allah. In response to this,
	the Prophet presented the she-camel as a Sign. This is a positive
	proof of the fact that the birth of the she-camel had taken place in
	some miraculous manner and her appearance was a miracle of the same
	kind as presented by other Prophets to the disbelievers at their
	demand of a proof of their Prophethood. Another proof of her
	miraculous birth is the fact that Prophet Salih presented the
	she-camel to the disbelievers with a warning to this effect: &quot;Your
	lives are directly connected with the life of this she-camel. She
	shall graze freely in your fields and she shall be privileged to
	drink water at the well one day all alone by herself, and all your
	cattle shall drink water the following day, turn by turn; and if you
	touch her with an evil intention, Allah's scourge will overtake you
	all of a sudden&quot;. It is obvious from this that the she-camel
	could have been presented in such a forcible manner only if the
	people had seen with their own eyes that she was an extraordinary
	animal. That is why they let her graze freely in their fields and
	let her drink water throughout the day all by herself, though in
	their heart of hearts they were not willing to accede to this. They
	were so much afraid of her that in order to kill her they had to
	hold long consultations and hatch secret plots, though Prophet Salih
	had no worldly power to prevent them from this. This shows that they

	satisfaction of sex urges and for the service of the natural
	function of reproduction of the species. Therefore the one who
	satisfies this sex urge in an unnatural way becomes guilty of many
	crimes at one and the same time. (1) Such a one, so to speak, wages
	a war against the natural and physical functioning of his own organs
	and those of the victims of his lust. This inevitably produces very
	harmful effects on their physiques, their minds and their morality.
	(2) He becomes guilty of treachery and dishonesty against Nature for
	he enjoys sexual pleasure, without performing the necessary service
	of his species and civilization and without fulfilling the rights
	and obligations attached to it. (3) He commits a breach of trust
	against the society in general for he enjoys all the benefits of the
	civilized society, but in his turn does not take on himself the
	responsibilities of the married life and wastes all his powers in
	the unnatural gratification of his sexual desires. This selfish and
	unworthy attitude is not only useless but also positively harmful to
	the collective morality. Thus he makes himself unfit for the service
	of the family and of the human race and produces unnatural feminine
	characteristics in, at least, one other male, and opens the way to
	adultery and moral degradation for at least two women.</P>

	citing the individual case of every Prophet and his people, now the
	general and comprehensive procedure has been enunciated, that Allah
	adopted at the appointment of each one of His Messengers. Whenever a
	Messenger was sent, Allah afflicted his people with adversities and
	calamities so that they should become meek and humble, and be
	conditioned for the acceptance of the Message. Accordingly, He sent
	famines and epidemics to them and made them suffer economic losses,
	defeats in wars, and the like, in order to humble their pride and
	haughtiness and to frustrate their over-confidence in their powers,
	riches, resources, capabilities etc. This was to make them realize
	that there is a Higher Power above them that controls their
	destinies so that their hearts should be inclined to admonition and
	they should bow down humbly before their Lord. But, if this failed
	to incline their hearts to the acceptance of the Truth, they were
	tempted with prosperity. And this was the beginning of their end. As
	a rule, when such people, as are afflicted with adversity and
	calamities, begin to flourish and are enriched with blessings, they
	do not show any gratitude to their Master, and even forget the days
	of adversity. Then their intellectuals delude them by arguing like
	this: &quot;There is nothing unusual in this. History tells us that
	the vicissitudes of fortune have always been taking place
	independent of moral values and these are not taking place under the
	control of Allah or in accordance with moral laws but blind nature
	is always working and bringing about adversity or prosperity. That
	is why our forefathers also had had their adversities and
	prosperities. It is, therefore, a sign of mental weakness to draw
	any moral lesson from these and to bow down and humble oneself
	before Allah.

	this furnace cleansed of all impurities. But the case of a hypocrite
	in affliction is that of an ass, who does not realize why his master
	tied him and why he untied him.&quot; This implies that if a
	community does not turn to Allah, even when adversities and
	calamities are inflicted on it or does not remember Allah in
	gratitude, when He showers His blessings upon it and is not inclined
	at all to reform itself in any way whatsoever, it is doomed and its
	destruction is imminent.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection it should also be noted that the Divine procedure
	mentioned in vv. 94-95 was at work at' Makkah at the time when this
	Surah was revealed. The Quraish were showing the same antagonistic
	attitude and were consequently suffering from a severe famine. We
	learn from a Tradition, related by Ibn Mas'ud and Ibn `Abbas, that
	when the Quraish began to oppose the mission of the Holy Prophet, he
	prayed, &quot;O Lord, help me against these people by a seven-year
	famine, like the one that visited Egypt during the time of Joseph&quot;.
	Accordingly, Allah sent a very severe famine to Makkah and things
	came to such a pass that they began to eat dead animals, skins,
	bones and even wool. Then the people of Makkah, under the leadership
	of Abu Sufyan, went to the Holy Prophet, and beseeched him to pray
	to Allah to remove the famine. But when Allah removed the famine and
	they began to flourish, they became all the more arrogant and their
	evil geniuses began to hinder even those from it whose hearts were
	somewhat inclined towards the Faith, saying, &quot;The famine was
	due to the vicissitudes of time, and was not different from the ones
	that visited us even before the advent of Muhammad (Allah's peace be
	upon him). Therefore you should not fall into his trap by its
	visitation.&quot; Such things as &quot;Our forefathers also had
	their adversity and prosperity&quot; were being repeated at the time
	when this Surah was sent down. As these verses applied very
	appropriately to the condition of the Quraish at the time, this

	According to the creed of the ancient Egyptians, every ruler based

	ruled from 1292 to 1225 B.C. And the second Pharaoh who has been
	mentioned in these verses was Mineptah, who assisted his father
	Rameses II in the affairs of the government, and succeeded as ruler
	after his death. But these dates appear to be doubtful because,
	according to the calendar of the Israelites, the year of the death
	of Moses was 1272 B.C. These are, however, mere historical guesses

	two Signs were given to Prophet Moses as a proof that he was a
	representative of Allah, the Creator and Sovereign of the whole
	universe. We have already stated that whenever the Messengers
	presented themselves before the people as the representatives of
	Allah, the people always demanded: &quot;If you are really a
	representative of Allah, let such and such an event take place
	through you as may not be capable of being explained by the ordinary
	laws of nature, and which may clearly show that it has happened by
	the direct intervention of Allah to prove that you are really a
	representative of Allah&quot;. In answer to this demand, the
	Prophets showed those Signs that are called 'ayat' by the Qur'an and
	miracles by the common people. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is a
	pity that sane learned Muslims try to explain away these Signs or
	miracles as ordinary events that took place according to the known
	physical laws of nature. They do not realize that in this way they
	arc adopting a skeptical attitude towards the Book of Allah, for, in
	the context, the Qur'an cites a supernatural event, and it presents
	the same as a Sigh of Allah as a proof of his Prophethood. Therefore
	to explain it away as an ordinary event is, in fact, to disbelieve
	the Book. Thus such people make their own position ridiculous. On
	the one hand, they do not sincerely believe in the Qur 'an as a Book
	of Allah just because it upholds miracles; en the other, they do not
	have the courage to declare openly their disbelief in the Book'
	which upholds supernatural events, because it would deprive them of
	the benefit of the religion they profess, as it would adversely
	affect their worldly interests.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	decisive question about miracles is whether Allah suspended His
	activities after starting the system of the universe according to
	certain laws, and now cannot interfere in any way whatever with the
	working of that system, Or, whether He keeps the reins of His
	kingdom in His own hands and enforces His commands every moment in
	this kingdom and He has full powers to make any change, partial or
	complete, in shaping things and the course of events, as and when He
	wills. Those who believe in the first alternative cannot believe in
	the miracles for it goes against their conception of Allah and His
	universe, but the most proper course for such people is to deny the
	Divine Revelation of the Qur'an instead of writing any commentary on
	it so as to refute the Quranic conception of Allah and prove their
	own. On the other hand, if one is convinced by the arguments of the
	Qur'an and accepts the second alternative he would readily
	understand and believe in the miracles. It is quite obvious that if
	one believes that a serpent can come into being only through a
	biological process and it is not possible for Allah to create it in
	any other way, then such a one should consider it false that a staff
	was changed into a serpent and again into the staff. On the
	contrary, if one believes that lifeless matter can come to life by
	the command of Allah, Who has the power to give any kind of life to
	anything He wills, he will readily believe that the staff was
	changed into a serpent just as he believes that a live chicken comes
	out of a lifeless egg. To such a person, there will be nothing
	extraordinary, just because the staff was changed into a serpent
	only thrice and a chicken comes out of an egg over and over again.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote88sym" HREF="#sdfootnote88anc">88</A>Naturally
	some questions arise here: How was Prophet Moses a danger to Pharaoh
	and his kingdom? How could a destitute person of a slave community
	like him be a menace to a powerful and rich king like Pharaoh, who
	was the object of worship of his subjects as well? How was the
	turning of the staff into a serpent menace to his great kingdom
	which extended from Syria to Libya and from the Mediterranean Sea to
	Abyssinia? Why did they then raise the alarm that Prophet Moses
	intended to deprive the great Pharaoh and the members of the royal
	dynasty and the big chiefs of their kingdom, and drive them out of
	Egypt? Above all, why was there a danger at all of a revolution,
	when he had put forward no other claim than that he was a Prophet of
	Allah; and demanded the freedom of the Israelites? These questions
	are specially important because so far no political talk had taken
	place between them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	answer is that the claim to Prophethood in itself implied that
	Prophet Moses meant to bring about a complete revolution in the
	existing system of life, including the political system as well. The
	very fact that a person claims to be a Delegate of the Lord of the
	universe, contains in itself the demand for total submission of
	human beings to himself. This is because the Delegate of the Lord of
	the universe does not come to live as a subject of and subordinate
	to anyone else but as the ruler and the guardian. For, it is the
	negation of his claim to Prophethood to acknowledge the sovereignty
	of an unbeliever. That is why Pharaoh and his courtiers felt the
	menace of a political, social and cultural revolution when Moses
	made a claim to Prophethood. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Let us
	consider the question: Why did the court of the great Pharaoh of
	Egypt attach so much importance to the claim of Moses, who had no
	other helper than his own brother, and no other emblem of his
	appointment from Allah than his miraculous staff and his shining
	hand? In my opinion there were two main reasons: First, Pharaoh and
	his courtiers were fully acquainted with the great personality of
	Prophet Moses. They knew that he possessed a pure and strong
	character and an extraordinary ability, and was a born leader and
	commander. Besides this, if we rely on the stories of the Talmud and
	Josephus, Prophet Moses had acquired education in all the sciences
	of the age, and was fully trained in the art of war and
	administration, because these things were considered essential for
	the members of the royal family in which he was brought up, and had
	proved himself to be an excellent general in the campaign against
	Abyssinia. Above all, the hard desert life of eight years or so in
	Midian had helped to remove the effects of a life of ease in the
	royal palace. Therefore, when this grand, serene and pious man stood
	in the court of Pharaoh with the claim of Prophethood, they could
	not brush aside his. claim as hollow. Secondly, when they saw the
	miracles of the staff and the shining hand, they were all filled
	with awe and were inclined to admit that there was, indeed, some
	supernatural force at his back. Thus there was an apparent
	contradiction in their calling him a magician and, at the same time,
	expressing a fear that he would drive them out of the country. This
	also showed that they had been nonplussed by the very first
	appearance of the Signs of Prophethood: If they had really
	considered Prophet Moses to be a magician, they would have never
	felt and expressed the danger of a revolution from him, for magic
	has never brought about any revolution in the world.

	produced by magic was merely an illusion. That is why they tried to
	refute the claim of Prophet Moses, saying, &quot;this man is an
	expert magician&quot;. They meant to say that the staff had not
	actually turned into a serpent but had only appeared so to them to
	be a serpent because of his magic and they would not acknowledge it

	sky was covered with clouds to protect them from the scorching heat

	there were those who were openly and boldly violating the Divine
	rules and regulations. Then there were some who did not violate the
	laws themselves but silently saw others violating them: they told
	admonishers that it was no good to give any piece of advice to those
	hardened law-breakers. Lastly, there were others who were so much

	that they would return to the Right Way, or at least, they
	themselves would be in a position to present the proof before their
	Lord that they, on their part, did their duty to admonish those
	law-breakers. Accordingly, when the scourge of Allah befell that
	township, the only people who were delivered from it were those who
	belonged to the third group. According to the Qur'an, they were
	delivered because they had shown their concern for the eradication
	of evil. The other two groups were counted among the workers of
	iniquity and punished in proportion to the nature and extent of
	their crime. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	commentators are of the view that it cannot be said with certainty
	whether the second group was among those who were delivered or among
	those who were punished, for the Qur'an is not explicit about this.
	According to a tradition from Ibn `Abbas (Allah be pleased with
	him), he was at first of the opinion that the second group was among
	those who were punished, but afterwards his disciple 'Ikrimah
	convinced him that it was among those who were delivered. But when
	we consider deeply the words of the Qur'an, we feel that his tirst
	opinion was correct for it is obvious that on the occasion of a
	scourge, the concerned township was divided into two groups only.
	One group consisted of those who were visited by the scourge, and
	the other of those who were delivered from it. Now when the Qur'an
	is explicit that the group that was delivered consisted of those who
	were forbidding evil, the other two groups must have been among
	those who were not delivered. This conclusion is supported by &quot;in
	order to offer an excuse before your Lord&quot;, and also by the
	succeeding verse, It is quite clear from this that the whole
	township, wherein the law of Allah is openly violated, is seized by
	His wrath, with the only exception of those who forbid evil. One
	will not be delivered simply because one did not violate the Law but
	shall (rave to show practically that one did exert one's utmost to
	establish virtue and eradicate vice. This view is further supported
	by other passages from the Qur'an and Hadith that this is the Law of
	Allah concerning collective crimes. The Qur'an says, &quot;Fear that
	trial which will not involve in scourge only those who will be
	guilty of transgression from among you .......&quot; (VIII: 25).
	Explaining this verse, the Holy Prophet says, &quot;Allah dces not
	punish the common people for the sins of sinful people unless the
	common people connive at those glaring sins that are committed
	before their very eyes and show no displeasure at them, in spite of
	the fact that they are in a position to do so. When they degenerate

	We are of the opinion that the scourge in the first case was
	inflicted on both the first and the second groups, but in the second

	Allah. But, instead of making the Covenant in an ordinary way, these

	occasion of the creation of Adam. At that time the angels were
	gathered together and commanded to bow down before him and man's
	appointment as Allah's vicegerent was proclaimed; likewise the whole
	of mankind that was to be born up to the Day of Resurrection was
	brought into existence at one and the same time and imbued with
	common-sense and brought forth in His presence and asked to testify
	that Allah is their Lord.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A
	tradition of Hadrat Ubayy-bin-Ka`ab which is most probably based on
	the knowledge he received from the Holy Prophet, is the best
	commentary or this verse. He says: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Allah
	gathered the whole of mankind and arranged it into separate groups
	according to their kinds or periods and gave them human shape and
	power of speech. Then He took a Covenant from them and made them
	witnesses concerning themselves and asked, `Am I not your Lord?'
	They answered, 'Most certainly, You alone are our Lord.' Then Allah
	said, `I ask the earth and the heavens and your father Adam to bear
	witness to this effect lest you should say on the Day of
	Resurrection that you had no knowledge of this. So note it well that
	none other than I is worthy of worship and that there is no other
	Lord than I. You should not set up any partner with Me. I will send
	to you My Messengers, who will remind you of this Covenant that you
	are Making with Me; I will also send My Book to you . At this the
	whole of mankind replied, &quot;We bear witness to this: You alone
	are our Lord and our Deity: we have no other lord or deity than
	You.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people take vv.172-173 as a symbolic narration: They are of the
	opinion that in this way the Qur'an intends merely to impress the
	fact that Allah's Divinity is implanted in the human nature and
	relates it in a way as if it had happened as a tangible event. But
	we do not consider this interpretation as correct because the Qur'an
	and the Hadith describe it as an event which actually took place.
	More than that it has been asserted that on the Day of Judgment the
	event of the Covenant will be brought forward as an authentic proof
	against mankind. Therefore there is no reason why we should regard
	this event as a symbolic narration. We believe that this event
	actually took place in the physical world. The All-Powerful Allah
	did actually bring into existence and gave understanding and power
	of speech to each and every individual in the posterity of Adam whom
	He intended to create up to the Day of Resurrection and assembled
	before Himself at one and the same time and took the Covenant from
	all of them to the effect that they had no other lord or god than
	Himself and that they had no other right way of life than Islam
	(surrender and submission to Allah). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Those who
	consider such an assemblage as impossible are in fact skeptical of
	the limitless powers of Allah: otherwise they would not have
	entertained any doubts about it because this is as easy for Allah as
	the gradual birth of mankind. The All-Powerful Allah, Who is
	bringing human beings into existence in the way he is doing now, has
	also the power to assemble all mankind before its birth and after
	its death. It meals to reason that Allah let all mankind know that
	He was going to make His vicegerents after giving them wisdom and
	understanding and authority and the right to exploit the resources
	of the earth, and that He also took the oath of allegiance from
	them. Thus it is obvious and clear that there is nothing impossible
	or strange in this assemblage of the whole of mankind on the

	this verse the object, for which the Covenant was taken from the
	whole of mankind has been stated: it was to make each and every
	individual fully and consciously responsible for his deeds so that
	those who would rebel against their Lord should be held accountable
	for their guilt. It has been made plain that after this Covenant
	they could not justify any sin on the ground that they had committed
	it in ignorance nor could they shift the responsibility for
	deviation on to their predecessors. Allah warns that by taking this
	Covenant He has imbued in the heart of every individual that He
	alone is his Allah and Lord. Therefore none can absolve himself from
	the responsibility for a deviation, saying, &quot;I was quite
	unaware of this&quot;, or &quot;I was led astray by my wrong
	environment.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, let us now consider a few questions that might arise.
	Supposing that this Covenant did take place, do we have any
	remembrance of this? Is anyone of us conscious that he was brought
	before his Allah on the occasion of the Creation and that the said
	dialogue did actually take place? If the answer is in the negative,
	then how can it be justified to bring such a Covenant as evidence
	against us, when we do not remember it nor are conscious of this
	Covenant? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	answer is that this will be brought against us as an evidence
	because, though its remembrance and consciousness has been removed
	from the memory and the conscious mind, it has been retained in the
	subconscious mind. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As to why
	it has been removed from the memory and the conscious mind the
	answer is obvious. If the impression of the Covenant had remained
	fresh in the memory and the conscious mind, then everyone would have
	automatically observed it, and the trial and test would have become
	meaningless. Thus the very object for which man has been created
	would have been tendered meaningless. It has, however, been retained
	in the subconscious mind as a potentiality, and can be brought into
	consciousness by intuition and internal factors as in the case of
	all other branches of subconscious knowledge. The fact is that
	whatever man has achieved in culture, civilization, morality,
	sciences and all other aspects of human activities, lay hidden as
	potentialities and was brought out by external factors and
	intuition. But it is also a fact that no education, no training, no
	environment, no external factor, no intuition is capable of creating
	any other thing than the one that already lies potentially in the
	subconscious mind. Likewise none of these factors is in any way
	capable of totally effacing the things that lie hidden potentially
	in the subconscious mind. The most that these factors can do is to
	pervert its nature, but in spite of all efforts to pervert it, it
	will still remain latent in the subconscious mind and will try to
	come to the surface in response to external factors. The following
	is true of all the branches of potential knowledge: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">All these
	exist as potentialities in our subconscious minds and prove their
	existence when they appear as actual actions. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">All
	potentialities require external stimuli, teaching and training to
	take practical shapes which, in fact. are a response of our
	potentialities to the external stimuli. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">All these
	things can be suppressed and made dormant by wrong desires and
	environment and perversions but can never be effaced totally from
	the subconscious mind. Therefore these can be reformed and converted
	by the help of inner feelings and external efforts. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Exactly
	the same is true of the intuitional knowledge we have regarding our
	own position in the universe and our relationship to the Creator of
	the universe. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">That this
	knowledge does really exist is proved by the fact that it has been
	appearing every now and then in every period of human life in every
	pan of the earth, in every habitation, in every posterity and in
	every generation and that no earthly power has been successful in
	effacing it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">That this
	conforms to the reality is shown by the fact that whenever this
	knowledge has actually been applied to practical life, it has always
	produced good and useful results. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There has
	always been need of some external appeal to cause them to appear and
	take practical shapes. Accordingly the Prophets, the Books, and
	inviters to the Truth from among the followers of the Prophets have
	been performing this service. That is why the Qur'an calls them
	remembrancers: for the Prophets, the Books and the inviters to the
	Truth do not create anything new in the minds of the people but
	refresh and bring to the surface by reminders what was already
	latent in them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	proof of the existence of this hidden knowledge in the human mind is
	that in every age, it has made a positive response to the call of
	the inviter and has come out as soon as it recognized his voice. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Above
	all, the greatest proof of the existence of this knowledge is that
	it Has survived in the human heap in spite of the strenuous and
	continuous efforts to suppress, conceal and pervert it. Though the
	powers of ignorance and folly, lusts and prejudices, misguidance and
	temptations, have succeeded in producing shirk, atheism,
	irreligiousness, deviation, they have failed to efface the impress
	of this inherent knowledge from the human heart. That is why it
	comes to the surface whenever efforts are made to revive it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the evidence of this inherent knowledge on the Day of
	Judgment, Allah will refresh and revive the memory of this Covenant,
	whereby they all acknowledged Allah alone as their Lord and Deity.
	Then He will show that this remained embedded in their hearts, in
	spite of its persistent denial in this world and will provide from
	their own selves the proof of the fact that the impress of this
	Covenant was always present in their minds and will show from the
	records of their lives how and when they suppressed the voice of
	this inherent knowledge: how and when their intuitional knowledge
	rebelled against their deviations, and how often it urged theta to
	respond to the invitation of the inviters to the Truth and how they
	silenced their inner voice by means of different pretexts. At that
	time, when all the secrets will be exposed, none will be able to put
	forward any excuses. Everyone shall have to confess one's guilt in
	plain and clear words. That is why the Qur'an says that they shall
	not say, &quot;We had no knowledge of this Covenant,&quot; but will
	have to confess, &quot;We were disbelievers and knowingly denied the
	Truth&quot;. They will stand witness against themselves to the

	benefits, lusts and comforts of the world and succumbed to
	temptations. He was so overpowered by avarice of these lower desires
	that he discarded all the higher things and let go waste all the

	avarice and lust. The dog is proverbial for these characteristics:
	its ever hanging tongue and watering mouth point to its insatiable
	greed: it goes on smelling the earth even when it is hit with a

	because of these things that the worldly man, who transgresses all

	questions have been posed to refute the charge that their comrade,

	was born and bred among them and had been their comrade before he
	claimed that he was appointed a Messenger by Allah. During all those
	years they had known him to be of a sound mind and of a good nature.
	Thus it is obvious that they charged him of having a distracted mind
	not because of what he said before his Prophethood but because of
	what he proclaimed as a Prophet. That is why they have been asked to
	reflect upon and point out anything from his Message which they
	regarded as meaningless, unreal and irrational. If they had ever
	reflected upon the wisdom of the wonderful administration of the

	order to understand this passage, it should be kept in mind that it
	criticizes the pagan Arabs for associating partners with Allah in
	the matter of the birth of children. They have been told to remember
	that the first man and his mate were brought into being by Allah:
	and they could not deny this. Then they also knew that it is He Who
	has arranged the birth of human beings after the first pair: that it
	is He by Whose will a woman becomes pregnant and who nourishes the
	child in her womb in a wonderful manner, and that it is He Who
	imbues it with a sound body and sound mind with various powers and
	capabilities and lets it come out as a healthy human being. They
	could not deny that all this is in the power of Allah alone. If
	Allah willed, He could have created a monkey, a serpent or any other
	animal in her womb or made the child deformed or physically or
	mentally defective. They knew that no one had the power to make any
	change in Allah's creation. That is why all their hopes were centred
	in Allah during the period of pregnancy and prayers were invoked for
	the birth of a perfect child. But it is an irony that the pagans as
	well as the Believers change their whole attitude after the birth of
	a child, and, instead of being grateful to Allah, they make their
	grateful offerings to some god or goddess or saint or the like and
	give such names as smack of shirk-Pir Bakhsh, &quot;Favor of the
	Saint,&quot; or Abdur-Rasul, &quot;Servant of the Prophet&quot; etc.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Though
	the passage is quite clear, yet a misunderstanding has arisen about
	it, which has been supported by weak traditions. The mention of the
	first man and woman (Adam and Eve) in the beginning, and immediately
	after it of a man and a woman, has led to the confusion that both
	the pairs were one and the same. Therefore some commentators were of
	the opinion that the man was Adam and the woman who became pregnant
	was Eve and that they prayed to Allah for their child in the womb,
	but when it was born, they associated others with Allah in this
	favor. Then, with the help of weak traditions they concocted a
	complete story about it: When several children of Eve died soon
	after their birth, Satan came to her at the birth of one, and
	seduced her saying, &quot;If you give him the name of `Abdul Harith,
	the servant of Satan, he will survive.&quot; It is all the more
	regrettable that some of these traditions have been linked up to the
	Holy Prophet. But the fact is that all these traditions are
	unauthentic and are not supported by the wording of the Qur'an and
	by the context in which they occur. The Qur'an criticizes the pagans
	for associating others with Allah in the matter of birth, when they
	themselves acknowledge that it is He Who is the Creator of the
	children which are born as a result of the cohabitation of a man and
	a woman. That is why they also invoke Allah for the safe delivery of
	the child; when they are not sure of the perfection of the child.
	But after the safe delivery of a sound child, they turn to others
	with gratitude and offerings. It is thus clear that it is not any
	particular man and woman who have been admonished for their
	behavior, but every man and every woman, (including pagan men and
	women) who behave like that. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection it should also be noted that the condition of the
	present-day Muslims is even worse than that of the pagan Arabs whom
	the Qur'an has condemned in this passage. They committed shirk after
	the delivery of the child, though before this they prayed to Allah
	for the child. But the Muslims of today, who claim to be the bearers
	of the creed of Tauhid, go far beyond this. These wretched people
	pray to others even for the birth of a child and make vows to others
	during the period of pregnancy, and after the delivery of the child
	make offerings to the associates they set up with Allah. Yet they
	consider those Arabs as pagans who deserved Hell, and themselves as
	Believers in One Allah, for whom Paradise has been guaranteed! &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote151sym" HREF="#sdfootnote151anc">150</A>In
	this passage Allah has taught His Messenger some very important
	things about the methods of inviting people to promulgating the
	Message of Islam, and of guiding and reforming people. The object is
	to instruct the Holy Prophet and, through him, his successors to
	enable them to carry on his mission after him. Some salient points
	are given below and should be considered in the order they are
	given: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	most important thing is that the inviter to the Truth should have a
	large and tender heart, and should be forgiving and forbearing. He
	should be friendly to his companions, kind to the common people, and
	should show forbearance to his opponents. He should tolerate the
	weaknesses of his comrades and endure patiently the persecution of
	his enemies. He should keep cool even under the greatest provocation
	and connive at the most unpleasant things. He should bear patiently
	the bitterest words, the most wicked slanders and the most cruel
	persecutions. Harsh treatment, hard-heartedness, bitter talk, and
	vindictive retaliations are as harmful as poison for this work: this
	spoils the work and does not mend it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is
	a tradition of the Holy Prophet to the same effect: &quot;My Lord
	has enjoined me to utter what is just whether I am in a state of
	anger or happiness: to try my best to have cordial relations even
	with those who are inimical to me: to render their rights even to
	those who deprive me of my rights: to forgive even those who are
	cruel to me.&quot; He advised those whom he sent on this Mission:
	&quot;Wherever you go, your visit should be a harbinger of happiness
	and not of hatred: you should become the source of comfort to the
	people and not of bringing hardships on them&quot;. Allah has also
	praised this characteristic of the Holy Prophet: (&quot;O Messenger,
	) it is a great blessing of Allah that you are very lenient towards
	and gentle with them. If you had been harsh and hard-hearted, they
	would have scattered away from you. . . &quot; (III: 159). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	second formula for the success of this Mission is to avoid
	philosophizing and to enjoin those simple and well-known virtues
	that are universally accepted to be virtues, and are easily
	recognized by common sense which an ordinary person possesses. Thus
	the appeal of the inviter to the Truth convinces every one. Its
	greatest advantage is that it helps win over the common people to
	the side of promulgators of the Truth, against its antagonists. When
	the common people, in spite of their prejudices, see on one side a
	gentle and kind person inviting them towards simple virtues, which
	they themselves wider stand well, and on the other, his antagonists
	opposing his noble mission with unmoral and inhuman devices, they
	turn away by and by from those degraded opponents and come to the
	inviter of the Truth. As a result of this, in the end, only those
	remain in tire field to oppose the Truth, whose own interests are
	closely linked with falsehood or those who are slaves of the
	traditions of their forefathers and of the customs of ignorance. The
	Holy Prophet owed his great success in Arabia to this wise policy.
	Then his successors achieved the same in the adjoining countries,
	where Islam spread by leaps and bounds and was accepted by the
	overwhelming majority of the people. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	other important instruction that has been given for the promulgation
	of Islam is to avoid useless discussions with the ignorant people.
	The inviter to the Truth should always be strictly on the guard
	against involvement in useless talk and discussion with mischievous
	and quarrelsome people. He should take the utmost care to approach
	and converse with those people only who adopt a reasonable and
	rational attitude towards his Message. As soon as he feels that his
	addressees are adopting the attitude of ignorance and are resorting
	to argumentations, wranglings and taunts, he should make an
	honorable retreat from them. This is because it is not only useless
	to be involved in such things but it is harmful to the mission, as
	valuable time and energy, that could have been usefully employed for
	the promulgation of the Message, go to waste. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) In
	case the inviter to the Truth feels that the provocations from the
	mischievous people are becoming too much for him to bear and he
	cannot withstand their tyrannies, mischiefs, foolish objections and
	accusations, he should at once realize that it is Satan who is
	tempting him to retaliate. Then the best thing is to seek refuge in
	Allah, and invoke His help to protect His servant from doing in
	anger anything that might be harmful to his Mission. This is
	possible only if one remains cool-headed even under the greatest
	provocations, for one can never think or act wisely if one is easily
	excited by anger, insult, injustice or cruelty etc. But Satan who
	does not like this Mission to succeed and is always devising schemes
	to defeat it, first incites own disciples to attack the inviter to
	the Truth and then incites him to make counter-attacks on them. As
	Satan's appeal is couched in very alluring words and pious terms, it
	is not an easy thing to withstand it. That is why pious people have
	been fore-warned, in vv. 201-202, of this serious danger and
	instructed that if they intend to refrain from evil, they should
	immediately get alarmed as soon as they feel the evil effects of the
	temptation of Satan and its incitement in their hearts and stand on
	their guard. Then they will clearly see the right course that they
	should adopt on such occasions and under such circumstances for the
	sake of their Mission. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	&quot;the brethren of Satan&quot;, they become self-seekers under
	their influence, and cannot withstand their temptation. So they
	follow satans, who tempt them to retaliate, and resort to every kind
	of abuse and dishonesty like their enemies. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides
	the above-mentioned particular implications of this passage, it
	bears a general meaning as well. It helps differentiate the way of
	the pious from that of the impious. Those who really fear Allah and
	sincerely desire to refrain from evil, are so sensitive that even if
	an evil thought so much as touches their hearts, it pricks their
	consciences and rankles in their hearts and they seek Allah's refuge
	from Satan. This is because they are not used to evil thoughts, evil
	desires and evil intentions, for these are foreign to their nature.
	As soon as they become conscious of their presence in their minds,
	their eyes are opened and their consciences recognize them. Then
	they seek Allah's refuge from Satan in order to cleanse their hearts
	of those dirty things. In contrast to them, those, who do not tear
	Allah nor desire to refrain from evil and those who have satans as
	their brethren, go on cherishing evil thoughts, evil intentions and
	evil designs in their hearts without feeling anything strange in
	them. So much so that no sense of cleanliness is left in their
	minds: and in due course, these ding things take practical shapes
	and expose them before the world.

	interpretation. According to Imam Abu Hanifah and his companions,
	the followers in the congregation should not recite anything whether
	the Imam is reciting the Qur'an aloud or silently in his mind.
	However, Imam Malik and Imam Ahmad arc of the opinion that only in
	that case when the Imam is reciting the Qur'an aloud, the followers
	should not recite anything, but in the other case they should recite
	Surah Al-Fatihah. But according to Imam Shafi'i, the followers must
	recite Surah AI-Fatihah, whether the Imam is reciting loudly or
	silently in his mind. He bases his opinion on the Traditions

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the manner of the performance of sajdah. we learn from

	Sometimes while the Holy Prophet was reciting a verse that required
	the performance of sajdah, he himself would prostrate then and
	there, and everyone in the gathering did the same so much so that if
	one did not find room fur it on the ground. he would perform it by
	laying his head on the back of the man in front of him. We also
	learn from Traditions that on the occasion of the Conquest of
	Makkah, when the Holy Prophet was reciting the Qur'an, a verse
	requiring the performance of sajdah occurred. Then those who were
	standing on the ground performed it on the ground, while those who
	were riding their horses or caramels performed it on the backs of

	resumed his address.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	majority of the Muslims arc of the opinion that the conditions for
	the performance of sajdah are the same as for the performance of
	Salat. But there is no proof for these conditions in the Traditions
	concerning sajdah. we find from them that when a person hears a
	verse requiring sajdah, he should bend down his head wherever and in
	whatever position he may be irrespective of these conditions. He
	should not mind whether he is in a state of ablutions or not;
	whether he can turn his face towards the qiblah or not; whether it
	is possible for hull to prostrate his head on the ground or not. We
	trod examples of the lcarncd and pious people in the past following
	the same practice. According to Imam Bukhari, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin
	'Umar would perfom sajdah whether he was In a state of ablutions or
	not. It is cited in Fatehulbari that Abu 'Abdur-Rehman Sulami would
	recite the Qur'an while he was walking and would merely bend down
	his head when he read a verse requiring sajdah, whether he was in a
	state of ablutions or not and whether he was facing qiblah or not.
	From these we have come to the conclusion that, though the method
	followed by the majority is more prudent, if a person follows a
	practice different from that of the majority, he should not be
