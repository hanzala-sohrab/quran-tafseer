<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
commentators and traditionists are unanimous about the occasion of
the revelation of this Surah. According to them, once some big chiefs
of Makkah were sitting in the Holy Prophet's assembly and he was
earnestly engaged in trying to persuade them to accept Islam. At that
very point, a blind man, named Ibn Umm Maktum, approached him to seek
explanation of some point concerning Islam. The Holy Prophet (upon
whom be peace) disliked his interruption and ignored him. Thereupon
Allah sent down this Surah. From this historical incident the period
of the revelation of this Surah can be precisely determined. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the first place, it is confirmed that Hadrat Ibn Umm Maktum was one
of the earliest converts to Islam. Hafiz Ibn Hajar and Hafiz Ibn
Kathir have stated that he was one of those who had accepted Islam at
a very early stage at Makkah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Secondly,
some of the traditions of the Hadith which relate this incident show
that he had already accepted Islam and some others show that be was
inclined to accept it and had approached the Holy Prophet in search
of the truth. Hadrat Aishah states that coming to the Holy Prophet he
had said: &quot;O Messenger of Allah, guide me to the straight path.&quot;
(Tirmidhi, Hakim, Ibn Hibban, Ibn Jarir, Abu Ya'la. According to
Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas, he had asked the meaning of a verse of the
Qur'an and said to the Holy Prophet: &quot;O Messenger of Allah,
teach me the knowledge that Allah has taught you.&quot; Ibn Jarir,
Ibn Abu Hatim). These statements show that he had acknowledged the
Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace as a Messenger of Allah and the
Quran as a Book of Allah. Contrary to this, Ibn Zaid has interpreted
the words </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">la
allahu yazzakka</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">of verse 3 to mean: </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">la
allahu yuslim</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">:
&quot;maybe that he accepts Islam.&quot; (Ibn Jarir) And Allah's own
words: &quot;What would make you know that he might reform, or heed
the admonition, and admonishing might profit him?&quot; and &quot;The
one who comes to you running, of his own will, and fears, from him
you turn away&quot;, point out that by that time he had developed in
himself a deep desire to learn the truth: he had come to the Holy
Prophet with the belief that he was the only source of guidance and
his desire would be satisfied only through him; his apparent state
also reflected that if he was given instruction, he would benefit by
it. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thirdly,
the names of the people who were sitting in the Holy Prophet's
assembly at that time, have been given in different traditions. In
this list we find the names of `Utbah, Shaibah, Abu Jahl, Umayyah bin
Khalaf, Ubayy bin Khalaf, who were the bitterest enemies of Islam.
This shows that the incident took place in the period when these
chiefs were still on meeting terms with the Holy Prophet and their
antagonism to Islam had not yet grown so strong as to have stopped
their paying visits to him and having dialogues with him off and on.
All these arguments indicate that this is one of the very earliest
Surahs to be revealed at Makkah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
view of the apparent style with which the discourse opens, one feels
that in this Surah Allah has expressed His displeasure against the
Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) for his treating the blind man with
indifference and attending to the big chiefs exclusively. But when
the whole Surah is considered objectively, one finds that the
displeasure, in fact, has been expressed against the disbelieving
Quraish, who because of their arrogant attitude and indifference to
the truth, were rejecting with contempt the message of truth being
conveyed by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). Then, besides
teaching him the correct method of preaching, the error of the method
that he was adopting at the start of his mission has also been
pointed out. His treating the blind man with neglect and disregard
and devoting all his attention to the Quraish chiefs was not for the
reason that he regarded the rich as noble and a poor blind man as
contemptible, and, God forbid, there was some rudeness in his manner
for which Allah reproved him. But, as a matter of fact, when a caller
to Truth embarks on his mission of conveying his message to the
people, he naturally wants the most influential people of society to
accept his message so that his task becomes easy, for even if his
invitation spreads among the poor and weak people, it cannot make
much difference. Almost the same attitude had the Holy Prophet (upon
whom be peace) also adopted in the beginning, his motive being only
sincerity and a desire to promote his mission and not any idea of
respect for the big people and hatred for the small people. But Allah
made him realize that that was not the correct method of extending
invitation to Islam, but from his mission's point of view, every man,
who was a seeker after truth, was important, even if he was weak, or
poor, and every man, who was heedless to the truth, was unimportant,
even if he occupied a high position in society. Therefore, he should
openly proclaim and convey the teachings of Islam to all and sundry,
but the people who were really worthy of his attention, were those
who were inclined to accept the Truth, and his sublime and noble
message was too high to be presented before those haughty people who
in their arrogance and vanity thought that they did not stand in need
of him but rather he stood in need of them. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
is the theme of vv. 1-16. From verse 17 onward the rebuke directly
turns to the disbelievers, who were repudiating the invitation of the
Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom be peace). In this, first they
have been reproved for their attitude which they had adopted against
their Creator, Providence and Sustainer. In the end, they have been
warned of the dreadful fate that they would meet in consequence of
their conduct on the Day of Resurrection. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>The
	style of this first sentence is elegant and subtle. Although in the
	following sentences the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been
	directly addressed, which by itself shows that the act of frowning
	and turning aside had issued forth from him, the discourse has been
	opened in a manner as though it was not he but some one else who had
	so acted. By this style the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace), by a
	subtle method, has been made to realize that it was an act unseemly
	for him. Had somebody familiar with his high morals witnessed it, he
	would have thought that it was not he but some other person who had
	behaved in that manner. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The blind
	man referred to here implies, as we have explained in the
	Introduction, the well-known Companion, Hadrat Ibn Umm Maktum. Hafiz
	Ibn 'Abdul Barr in Al-Isti'ab and Hafiz Ibn Hajar in Al-Isbah have
	stated that he was a first cousin of the Holy Prophet's wife, Hadrat
	Khadijah. His mother, Umm Maktum, and Hadrat Khadijah's father,
	Khuwailid, were sister and brother to each other. After one knows
	his relationship with the Holy Prophet, there remains no room for
	the doubt that he had turned away from him regarding him as a poor
	man having a low station in life, and attended to the high-placed
	people, for he was the Holy Prophet's brother-in-law and a man of
	noble birth. The reason why the Holy Prophet had shown disregard for
	him is indicated by the word a ma (blind man), which Allah Himself
	has used as the cause of the Holy Prophet's inattention. That is,
	the Holy Prophet thought that even if a single man from among the
	people whom he was trying to bring to the right path, listened to
	him and was rightly guided, be could become a powerful means of
	strengthening Islam. On the contrary, Ibn Umm Maktum was a blind
	man, who could not prove to be so useful for Islam because of his
	disability as could one of the Quraish elders on becoming a Muslim.
	Therefore, he should not interrupt the conversation at that time;
	whatever he wanted to ask or learn, he could ask or learn at some
	later time.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>This
	is the real point which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had
	overlooked in the preaching of Islam on that occasion, and for
	teaching him the same Allah first reproved him on his treatment of
	Ibn Umm Maktum, and then ' told him what really deserved to occupy
	his attention as preacher of the Truth and what did not. There is a
	man whose apparent state clearly shows that he is a seeker after
	truth: he fears lest he should follow falsehood and invite Allah's
	wrath; therefore, he comes all the way in search of the knowledge of
	the true faith. There is another man, whose attitude clearly
	reflects that he has no desire for the truth; rather on the
	contrary, he regards himself as self-sufficient, having no desire to
	be guided to the right way. Between these two kinds of men one
	should not see whose becoming a Muslim would be of greater use for
	Islam and whose becoming a believer could not be of any use in its
	propagation. But one should see as to who was inclined to accept the
	guidance and reform himself, and who was least interested in this
	precious bargain. The first kind of man, whether he is blind, lame,
	crippled. or an indigent mendicant, who might apparently seem
	incapable of rendering any useful service in the propagation of
	Islam, is in any case a .valuable man for the preacher to the Truth.
	To him therefore he should attend, for the real object of this
	invitation is to reform the people, and the apparent state of the
	person shows that if he was instructed he would accept guidance. As
	for the other kind of man, the preacher has no need to pursue him,
	no matter how influential he is in society. For his attitude and
	conduct openly proclaim that he has no desire for reform; therefore,
	any effort made to reform him would be mere waste of time. If he has
	no desire to reform himself, he may nor the loss would be his, the
	preacher would not at all be accountable for it.&nbsp;
