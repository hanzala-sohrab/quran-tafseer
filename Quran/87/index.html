subject matter shows that this too is one of the earliest Surahs to
be revealed, and the words: &quot;We shall enable you to recite, then
you shall never forget&quot; of verse 6 also indicate that it was
sent down in the period when the Holy Messenger (upon whom he Allah's
peace) was not yet fully accustomed to receive Revelation and at the
time Revelation came down he feared lest he should forget its words.
If this verse is read along with verse 114 of Surah Ta Ha and verses
16-19 of Al-Qiyamah and the three verses are also considered with
regard to their styles and contexts, the sequence of events seems to
be that first in this Surah the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was
reassured to the effect: &quot;Do not at all worry: We shall enable
you to recite this Word, then you shall not forget it.&quot; Then
after a lapse of time, on another occasion, when the Surah Al-Qiyamah
was being revealed, the Holy Prophet involuntarily began to rehearse
the words of the Revelation. Thereupon it was said: &quot;O Prophet
do not move your tongue to remember this Revelation hastily. It is
for Us to have it remembered and read. Therefore when We are reciting
it, listen to its recital carefully. Again, it is for Us to explain
its meaning.&quot;Last of all, on the occasion of the revelation of
Surah Ta Ha, the Holy Prophet on account of human weakness, again
became afraid lest his memory should fail to preserve some portion of
the 113 verses which were continuously revealed at that time, and
therefore, he began to memorize them. Thereupon, it was said: &quot;And
see that you do not hasten to recite the Quran before its revelation
is completed to you.&quot;After this, it never so happened that he
felt any such danger, for apart form these three places, there is no
other place in the Quran where there might be a reference to this
matter. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

your only duty is to convey the truth, and the simplest way of
conveying the truth is that admonition be given to him who is
inclined to listen to the admonition and accept it, and the one who
is not inclined to it, should not be pursued. The one who fears the
evil consequences of deviation and falsehood, will listen to the
truth and accept it, and the wretched one who avoids listening to and

who adopt purity of belief, morals and deed, and remember the name of
their Lord and perform the Prayer. But, on the contrary, the people
are wholly lost in seeking the ease, benefits and pleasures of the
world, whereas they should actually endeavor for their well being in
the Hereafter, for the world is transitory and the Hereafter
everlasting and the blessings of the Hereafter are far better than
the blessings of the world. This truth has not been expressed only in
the Qur'an but in the books of the Prophets Abraham and Moses too, it
had been brought to the notice of man. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) Allah
	should be remembered by the names which fit Him, and no such name
	should be used for His exalted Being which, with regard to its
	meaning and sense, does not fit Him, or which reflects some aspect
	of deficiency, lack of reverence, polytheism about Him, or which
	refers to some wrong belief in respect of His Being, attributes, or
	works. For this purpose, the safest way is that only such names be
	used for Allah, which He himself has mentioned in the Qur'an, or
	which are a correct translation of these names in other languages. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) Allah
	should not be remembered by the names as are used generally for the
	created beings, or the created beings should not be called by names
	as are specifically meant for Allah. And if there are some
	attributive names which are not specifically meant for Allah, but
	may also be used for the created beings, such as Ra'uf (Kind), Rahim
	(Compassionate), Karim (Generous), Sami` ( I Hearing), Basir
	(Seeing), etc. one should exercise due care not to use them for man
	as they are used for Allah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) Allah
	should not be mentioned in a way or in a state which reflects lack
	of respect for Him; for example, to mention His name when engaged in
	mockery or jest, or when in the lavatory, or while committing a
	sinful act, or before the people who might behave insolently in
	response or in assemblies where the people are engaged in absurd
	things and might laugh off His mention, or on an occasion when it is
	feared that the hearer will hear it disdainfully. About Imam Malik,
	it is related that when a beggar begged him for something and he did
	not have anything to give, he would not turn away the beggar, saying
	that Allah would help him, as is commonly done by the people, but he
	would excuse himself in some other way. When asked why he did so, he
	replied: &quot;When the beggar is not given anything and one makes
	an excuse, it inevitably displeases him. On such an occasion, I do
	not like to mention Allah's name, for I do not like that somebody
	should hear His name in a state of annoyance and displeasure.&quot;

	gave everything He created the best form&quot; (v. 7) Thus, the
	creation of everything in the world giving it due order and

	come about without a pre-conceived plan, haphazardly, but for it the
	Creator had a full plan before Him, and everything is happening
	according to that plan. (For further explanation, see E.N.'s 13, 14

	is, nothing was just created and left to itself, but whatever was
	created to perform a certain function, it was also taught the method
	of performing that function. In other words, He is not merely the
	Creator but Guide too. He has taken the responsibility to give
	guidance to whatever He has created in a particular capacity to fit
	its nature and to guide it in the way suitable for it. One kind of
	guidance is for the earth, the moon, the sun, and the stars and
	planets, which they are following in performing their role. Another
	kind of guidance is for water, air, light and the solid and mineral
	elements, and they are performing the same services for which they
	have been created accordingly. Still another kind of guidance is for
	vegetables, according to which they take root and spread in the
	earth, sprout up from its layers, obtain food from wherever Allah
	has created it for thetas, produce stem, branches, leaves, blossom
	and fruit, and fulfill the function which has been appointed for
	each of them. Still another kind of guidance is for the countless
	species of animals of the land, and water, and for each member of
	the species, the wonderful manifestations of which are clearly
	visible in the life of the animals and in their works, so much so
	that even an atheist is compelled to concede that different kinds of
	animals possess some sort of inspirational knowledge which man
	cannot obtain even through his instruments, not to speak of his
	senses. Then, there are two different kinds of guidance for man,
	which correspond to his two different capacities. One kind of
	guidance is for his animal life, by which each child learns to suck
	milk spontaneously on birth, by which the eyes of man, his nose,
	ear, heart, brain, lungs, kidney, liver, stomach, intestines,
	nerves, veins and arteries, all are performing their respective
	functions, without man's being conscious of it, or his will having
	anything to do with the functions of these organs. This is the
	guidance under which all physical and mental changes pertaining to
	childhood, maturity, youth and old age go on taking place in man,
	independent of his will, choice, even his consciousness. The second
	kind of guidance is for his intellectual and conscious life, the
	nature of which is absolutely different from the guidance for
	unconscious life, for in this sphere of life a kind of freedom has
	been transferred to man, for which the mode of guidance meant for
	voluntary life is not suitable. For turning away from this last kind
	of guidance, man may offer whatever arguments and excuses he may
	like, it is not credible that the Creator Who has arranged guidance
	for everything in this universe according to its capacity, might
	have set for man the destiny that he may appropriate numerous things
	in His world freely, but might not have made any arrangement to show
	what is the right way of using his choice and what is the wrong way.

	Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be

	forget them. Mujahid and Kalbi say that even before Gabriel finished
	recitation of the Revelation the Holy Prophet would start repeating
	the initial verses lest he should forget them. On this very basis
	Allah assured him that he should listen quietly when the Revelation
	was coming down, for, &quot;We shall enable you to recite it; then
	you will remember it for ever. You should have no fear that you will
	forget any word of it. &quot; This is the third occasion where the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been taught the method of
	receiving the Revelation. The first two occasions have been referred
	to in Ta Ha: 114 and Al-Qiyamah: 16-19 above. This verse proves that
	just as the Qur'an was sent down to the Holy Prophet as a miracle,
	so also its each word was preserved in his memory as a miracle and
	no possibility was allowed to remain that he should forget anything
	of it, or that he should utter another synonymous word for any word

	manifestation of your own power but the result of Allah Almighty's
	bounty and grace; otherwise if Allah so willed, He could cause it to
	be forgotten. &quot; This same theme has been expressed at another
	place in the Qur'an, thus: &quot;O Muhammad! We may, if We so will,
	take back from you all of what We have revealed to you.&quot; (Bani
	Isra'il: 86). Another meaning also can be: &quot;Your forgetting
	something temporarily, or your forgetting a verse or a word
	occasionally is an exception froth this promise. What has been
	promised is: `You will not forget any word of the Qur'an
	permanently'.&quot; This meaning is confirmed by the following
	tradition of Bukhari: Once while leading the Fajr Prayer the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace) happened to omit a verse during the
	recitation. After the Prayer hadrat Ubayy bin Ka`b asked if the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote10sym" HREF="#sdfootnote10anc">10</A>Generally,
	the commentators take these as two separate sentences. They
	interpret the first sentence to mean: &quot;We are giving you a
	simple code of law, which is easy to practice and act upon&quot;,
	and the second sentence to mean: &quot;Admonish the people if
	admonishing be useful. &quot; but in our opinion, the word
	&quot;fa-dhakkir&quot; connects the two sentences in meaning, and
	the theme of the second sentence bears upon the theme of the first
	sentence. Therefore, we interpret these sentences to mean: &quot;O
	Prophet! We do not want to put you to any hardship concerning the
	preaching of Islam by demanding that you should snake the deaf to
	hear and the blind to see the way, but We have appointed an easy way
	for you, which is this: Give admonition when you feel that the
	people are inclined to benefit by it. As to who is inclined to
	benefit by the admonition and who is not, this you can only know
	through general preaching. Therefore, you should continue your
	general preaching, but your object should be to search out those
	from among the people who will benefit by it and adopt the right
	way. Such people alone are worthy of your attention and you should
	pay full attention only to their instruction and training. You need
	not abandon them and pursue those about whom you find by experience
	that they are not inclined to accept any admonition.&quot; Almost
	this very theme has been expressed in Surah 'Abasa in another way,
	thus: &quot;As for him who is indifferent, to him you attend, though
	you would not be responsible if he does not reform. And the one who
	comes to you running, of his own will and fears, from him you turn
	away. By no means: This is but an Admonition. Let him who wills,
	accept it.&quot; (vv. 5-12).&nbsp;
