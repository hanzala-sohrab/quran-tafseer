<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">As
we have explained in E. N. 4 of Surah Al-Buruj above, in retaliation
for the persecution of the followers of the Prophet Jesus Christ
(peace be on him) in Najran by the Jewish ruler Dhu-Nuwas of Yemen,
the Christian kingdom of Abyssinia invaded Yemen and put an end to
the Himyarite rule there, and in 52S A. D. this whole land passed
under Abyssinian control. This happened, in fact, through
collaboration between the Byzantine empire of Constantinople and the
Abyssinian kingdom, for the Abyssinians at that time had no naval
fleet. The fleet was provided by Byzantium and Abyssinia sent 70,000
of its troops by it across the Red Sea to Yemen. At the outset one
should understand that all this did not happen under the religious
zeal but there were economic and political factors also working
behind it, and probably these were the real motive, and retaliation
for the Christian blood was just an excuse. Since the time the
Byzantine empire had occupied Egypt and Syria, it had been trying to
gain control over the trade going on between East Africa, India,
Indonesia, etc., and the Byzantine dominions: from the Arabs, who had
been controlling it for centuries, so as to earn maximum profits by
eliminating the intermediary Arab merchants. For this purpose, in 24
or 25 B. C., Caesar Augustus sent a large army under the Roman
general, Aelius Gallus, which landed on the western coast of Arabia,
in order to intercept and occupy the sea route between southern
Arabia and Syria. (See map of this trade route on p. 111 of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
Meaning of the Qur'an</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
vol. iv). But the campaign failed to achieve its objective on account
of the extreme geographical conditions of Arabia. After this, the
Byzantines brought their fleet into the Red Sea and put an end to the
Arab trade which they carried out by sea, with the result that they
were left only with the land route. To capture this very land route
they conspired with the Abyssinian Christians and aiding them with
their fleet helped them to occupy Yemen. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Arab historians statements about the Abyssinian army that invaded
Yemen are different. Hafiz Ibn Kathir says that it was led by two
commanders, Aryat and Abrahah, and according to Muhammad bin Ishaq,
its commander was Aryat, and Abrahah was included in it. Then both
are agreed that Aryat and Abrahah fell out, Aryat was killed in the
encounter, and Abrahah took possession of the country; then somehow
he persuaded the Abyssinian king to appoint him his viceroy over
Yemen. On the contrary, the Greek and Syrian historians state that
when after the conquest of Yemen, the Abyssinians started putting to
death the Yamanite chiefs, who had put up resistance, one of the
chiefs, named As-Sumayfi Ashwa (whom the Greek historians call
Esymphaeus) yielded to the Abyssinians and promising to pay tribute
obtained the Abyssinian king's warrant to be governor over Yemen. But
the Abyssinian army revolted against him and made Abrahah governor in
his place. This man was the slave of a Greek merchant of the
Abyssinian seaport of Adolis, who by clever diplomacy had come to
wield great influence in the Abyssinian army occupying Yemen. The
troops sent by the Negus to punish him either warned him or were
defeated by him. Subsequently, after the death of the king, his
successor was reconciled to accept him as his vice regent of
Yemen.(The Greek historians write him as Abrames and the Syrian
historians as Abraham. Abrahah perhaps is an Abyssinian variant of
Abraham, for its Arabic version is Ibrahim). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
man through passage of time became an independent ruler of Yemen. He
acknowledged the sovereignty of the Negus only in name and described
himself as his deputy. The influence he wielded can be judged from
the fact that after the restoration of the dam of Marib in 543 A. D.
he celebrated the event by holding a grand feast, which was attended
by the ambassadors of the Byzantine emperor, king of Iran, king of
Hirah, and king of Ghassan. Its full details are given in the
inscription that Abrahah installed on the dam. This inscription is
extant and Glaser has published it.(For further details, see E. N. 37
of the commentary of Surah Saba). </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
stabilizing his rule in Yemen Abrahah turned his attention to the
objective which from the very beginning of this campaign had been
before the Byzantine empire and its allies, the Abyssinian
Christians, i. e. to spread Christianity in Arabia, on the one hand,
and to capture the trade that was carried out through the Arabs
between the eastern lands and the Byzantine dominions, on the other.
The need, for this increased because the Byzantine struggle for power
against the Sasanian empire of Iran had blocked all the routes of the
Byzantine trade with the East. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To
achieve this objective, Abrahah built in Sana, the capital of Yemen,
a magnificent cathedral, called by the Arabian historians al-Qalis,
al-Qullais, or al-Qulais, this word being an Arabic version of the
Greek word Ekklesia, church. According, to Muhammad bin Ishaq, after
having completed the building, he wrote to the Negus, saying: &quot;I
shall not rest until I have diverted the Arabs pilgrimage to it.&quot;Ibn
Kathir writes that he openly declared his intention in Yemen and got
it publicly announced. He, in fact, wanted to provoke the Arabs into
doing something which should provide him with an excuse to attack
Makkah and destroy the Ka'bah. Muhammad bin Ishaq says that an Arab,
enraged at this public proclamation somehow went into the cathedral
and defiled it. Ibn Kathir says this was done by a Quraishite and
according to Muqatil bin Suleman, some young men of the Quraish had
set fire to the cathedral. Either might have happened, for Abrahah's
proclamation was certainly provocative and in the ancient pre-Islamic
age it cannot be impossible that an Arab, or a Quraishite youth,
might have been enraged and might have defiled the cathedral, or set
fire to it. But it may well also be that Abrahah himself got this
done secretly by his own agent so as to have an excuse for invading
Makkah and thus achieving both his objectives by destroying the
Quraish and intimidating the Arabs. In any case, whatever happened,
when the report reached Abrahah that the devotees of the Ka'bah had
thus defiled his cathedral, he swore that he would not rest until he
had destroyed the Ka'bah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>So,
in 570 or 571 A. D., he took 60,000 troops and 13 elephants
(according to another tradition, 9 elephants) and set off for Makkah.
On the way, first a Yamanite chief, Dhu Nafr by name, mustering an
army of the Arabs, resisted him but was defeated and taken prisoner.
Then in the country of Khath'am he was opposed by Nufail bin Habib
al-Khath'am, with his tribe, but he too was defeated and taken
prisoner, and in order to save his life he accepted to serve him as
guide in the Arab country. When he reached near Ta'if, Bani Thaqif
felt that they would not be able to resist such a big force and
feeling the danger lest he should destroy the temple of their deity
Lat, too; their chief, Mas'ud. came out to Abrahah with his men, and
he told him that their temple was not the temple he had come to
destroy. The temple He sought was in Makkah, and they would send with
him a man to guide him there. Abrahah accepted the offer, and Bani
Thaqif sent Abu Righal as guide with him. When they reached
al-Mughammas (or al- Mughammis), a place about 3 miles short of
Makkah, Abu Righal died, and the Arabs stoned his grave and the
practice survives to this day. They cursed the Bani Thaqif too, for
in order to save the temple of Lat they had cooperated with the
invaders of the House of Allah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>According
to Muhammad bin Ishaq, from al- Mughammas Abrahah sent forward his
vanguard and they brought him the plunder of the people of Tihamah
and Quraish, which included two hundred camels of Abdul Muttalib, the
grandfather of the Holy Messenger of Allah (upon whom be His peace).
Then, he sent an envoy of his to Makkah with the message that he had
not come to fight the people of Makkah but only to destroy the House
(i. e. the Ka'bah). If they offered no resistance, there would be no
cause for bloodshed. Abrahah also instructed his envoy that if the
people of Makkah wanted to negotiate, he should return with their
leading chief to him. The leading chief of Makkah at that time was
Abdul Muttalib. The envoy went to him and delivered Abrahah's
message. Abdul Muttalib replied:&quot;We have no power to fight
Abrahah. This is Allah's House. If He wills He will save His House.&quot;
The envoy asked him to go with him to Abrahah. He agreed and
accompanied him to the king. Now Abdul Muttalib was such a dignified
and handsome man that when, Abrahah saw him he was much impressed; he
got off his throne and sat beside him on the carpet. Then he asked
him what he wanted. Abdul Muttalib replied that he wanted the king to
return his camels which he had taken. Abrahah said: &quot;I was much
impressed when I saw you but your reply has brought you down in my
eyes: you only demand your camels but you say nothing about this
House which is your sanctuary and the sanctuary of your forefathers.&quot;
He replied: &quot;I am the owner of my camels and am requesting you
to return them. As for the House, it has its own Owner: He will
defend it.&quot; When Abrahah said that He would not be able to
defend it against him, Abdul Muttalib said that that rested between
Him and him. With this Abdul Muttalib left Abrahah and he restored to
him his camels. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ibn
Abbas tradition is different. It does not mention the demand for the
camels at all. According to the traditions related from him by Abd
bin Humaid, Ibn al-Mundhir, lbn Marduyah, Hakim, Abu Nuaim and
Baihaqi, he states that when Abrahah reached As-Sifah (a place
situated between Arafat and Taif in the mountains near the sacred
bounds of Makkah), Abdul Muttalib went to him and said: &quot;There
was no need for you to come so far. You should have ordered us and we
would have brought before you whatever you needed.&quot; He said: &quot;I
hear that this House is the House of peace: I have come to destroy
its peace.&quot;Thereupon, Abdul Muttalib said: &quot;This is Allah's
House. He has not allowed anyone so far to dominate it.&quot;Abrahah
replied: &quot;We will not return until we have destroyed it.&quot;Abdul
Muttalib said:&quot;You may take whatever you like from us and
return.&quot;Abrahah refused to budge and ordered his troops to
advance, leaving Abdul Muttalib behind. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Leaving
the two traditions as they are, one thing which becomes evident is
that the tribes living in and around Makkah did not have the power to
fight such a big force and save the Ka'bah. Therefore, obviously, the
Quraish did not try to put up any resistance. The Quraish on the
occasion of the Battle of the Trench (Ahzab) had hardly been able to
muster &amp; strength numbering ten to twelve thousand men in spite
of the alliance with the pagan and Jewish tribes; they could not have
resisted an army 60,000 strong. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

bin Ishaq says that after returning from the camp of Abrahah Abdul
Muttalib ordered the Quraish to withdraw from the city and go to the
mountains along with their families for fear of a general massacre.
Then he went to the Ka'bah along with some chiefs of the Quraish and
taking hold of the iron ring of the door, prayed to Allah Almighty to
protect His House and its keepers. There were at that time 360 idols
in and around the Ka'bah, but on that critical moment they forgot
them and implored only Allah for help. Their supplications which have
been reported in the books of history do not contain any name but of

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Ibn

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
making these supplications Abdul Muttalib and his companions also
went off to the mountains. Next morning Abrahah prepared to enter
Makkah, but his special elephant, Mahmud, which was in the forefront,
knelt down. It was beaten with iron bars, goaded, even scarified, but
it would not get up. When they made it face south, north, or east, it
would immediately start off, but as soon as they directed it towards
Makkah, it knelt down. In the meantime swarms of birds appeared
carrying stones in their beaks and claws and showered these on the
troops. Whoever was hit would start disintegrating. According to
Muhammad bin Ishaq and Ikrimah, this was smallpox, which was seen in
Arabia for the first time in that year. Ibn Abbas says that whoever
was struck by a pebble, would start scratching his body resulting in
breaking of the skin and falling off of the flesh. In another
tradition Ibn Abbas says that the flesh and blood flowed like water
and bones in the body became visible. The same thing happened with
Abrahah too. His flesh fell in pieces and there arose bores on his
body emitting pus and blood. In confusion they withdrew and fled
towards Yemen. Nufail bin Habib, whom they had brought as guide from
the country of Khatham, was searched out and asked to guide them back
to Yemen, but he refused and said: &quot;Now where can one flee when
God pursues? The split nose (Abrahah) is the conquered; not the
conqueror.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Surah al-Fil is studied in the light of the historical details as
given above, one can fully well understand why in this Surah only
Allah's inflicting His punishment on the people of the elephant has
been referred and described so briefly. It was an event of recent
occurrence, and everyone in Makkah and Arabia was fully aware of it.
The Arabs believed that the Ka'bah had been protected in this
invasion not by any god or goddess but by Allah Almighty Himself.
Then Allah alone had been invoked by the Quraish chiefs for help, and
for quite a few years the people of Quraish having been impressed by
this event, had worshiped none but Allah. Therefore, there was no
need to mention the details in Surah al-Fil, but only a reference to
it was enough so that the people of Quraish, in particular, and the
people of Arabia, in general, should consider well in their hearts
the message that the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
peace and blessings) was giving. For the only message that he gave
was that they should worship and serve none but Allah, the Only and
One. Then, they should also consider that if they used force to
suppress this invitation to the truth, they would only be inviting
the wrath of God, Who had so completely routed and destroyed the
people of the elephants. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Maulana
	Hamid-ad-Din Farahi, who in the present age has done valuable work
	on the research and determination of the meaning and content of the
	Qur'an regards the people of Makkah and other Arabians as the
	subject of tarmihim in this verse, who are the addressees of alam
	tara. About the birds he says that they were not casting stones but
	had come to eat the dead bodies of the people of the elephant. A
	resume of the arguments he has given for this interpretation is that
	it is not credible that `Abdul Muttalib should have gone before
	Abrahah and demanded his camels instead of pleading for the Ka`bah,
	and this also is not credible that the people of Quraish and the
	other Arabs who had come for Hajj, did not resist the invaders and
	leaving the Ka`bah at their mercy had gone off to the mountains.
	Therefore, what actually happened was that the Arabs pelted the army
	of Abrahah with stones, and Allah by sending a stormy wind charged
	with stones, destroyed it completely; then the birds were sent to
	eat the dead bodies of the soldiers. But, as we have already
	explained in the Introduction, the tradition does not only say that
	`Abdul Muttalib had gone to demand his camels but it says that he
	did not demand the camels at all but tried to dissuade Abrahah from
	attacking the Ka`bah. We have already explained that according to
	all reliable traditions, Abrahah's army had come in Muharram when
	the pilgrims had gone back and also it was beyond the power of
	Quraish and other Arab tribes living in the surrounding areas to
	resist and fight an army 60,000 strong. They had hardly been able to
	muster a force ten to twelve thousand strong on the occasion of the
	Battle of the Trench (Ahzab) with the help of the Arab pagans and
	Jewish tribes then how could they have mustered courage to encounter
	an army, 60,000 strong? However. even if all these arguments are
	rejected and the sequence of the verses of Surah Al-Fil only is kept
	in view, this interpretation is seen to go against it. If it were so
	that the stones were cast by the Arabs and the people of the
	elephant were rendered as chaff, and then the birds came to eat
	their dead bodies, the order would be this: &quot;You were pelting
	them with stones of baked clay, then Allah rendered them as chaff
	eaten up, and then Allah sent upon them swarms of birds. &quot; but
	here we see that first Allah has made mention of sending swarms of
	birds; this is immediately followed by tarmihim bi-hijarat-im
	min-sijjil (which were pelting them with stones of baked clay); and
	then at the end it is said that Allah made them as straw eaten up.&nbsp;
