<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
style of the Surah and its subject matter clearly show that it was
revealed in the earliest stage at Makkah, when surah after surah was
being revealed to impress the doctrine of the Hereafter on the
people's minds. This Surah was revealed when they had started
ridiculing the Muslims and disgracing them publicly in the streets
and in their assemblies, but persecution and manhandling of the
Muslims had not yet started. Some commentators regard this as a
Madani Surah. This misunderstanding has been caused by a tradition
from Ibn Abbas according to which when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) arrived in Madinah, the evil of giving short weight and
measure was widespread among the people there. Then Allah sent down

ul-lil mutaffifin</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">and the people began to give full
weight and measure. (Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Marduyah, Ibn Jarir,
Baihaqi: </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Shu`ab-il-Iman</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">)
But, as we have explained in the introduction to Surah Ad-Dahr, the
common practice with the Companions and their successors was that
when they found that a verse applied to a certain matter of life,
they would say that it had been sent down concerning that particular
matter. Therefore, what is proved by the tradition of Ibn Abbas is
that when after his emigration to Madinah the Holy Prophet (upon whom
be peace) saw that the evil was widespread among the people there, he
recited this Surah before them by Allah's Command and this helped
them mend their ways. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
theme of this Surah too is the Hereafter. In the first six verses the
people have been taken to task for the prevalent evil practice in
their commercial dealings. When they had to receive their due from
others, they demanded that it be given in full, but when they had to
measure or weigh for others, they would give less than what was due.
Taking this one evil as an example out of countless evils prevalent
in society, it has been said that it is an inevitable result of the
heedlessness of the Hereafter. Unless the people realized that one
day they would have to appear before God and account for each single
act they performed in the world, it was not possible that they would
adopt piety and righteousness in their daily affairs. Even if a
person might practice honesty in some of his less important dealings
in view of &quot;honesty is the best policy,&quot; he would never
practice honesty on occasions when dishonesty would seem to be &quot;the
best policy&quot;. Man can develop true and enduring honesty only
when he fears God and sincerely believes in the Hereafter, for then
he would regard honesty not merely as &quot;a policy&quot; but as &quot;a
duty&quot; and obligation, and his being constant in it, or
otherwise, would not be dependent on its being useful or useless in
the world. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

after making explicit the relation between morality and the doctrine
of the Hereafter in an effective and impressive way, in vv. 7-17, it
has been said: The deeds of the wicked are already being recorded in
the black list of the culprits, and in the Hereafter they will meet
with utter ruin. Then in vv. 18-28, the best end of the virtuous has
been described and it has been laid that their deeds are being

	is, they have no good reason for regarding the meting out of rewards
	and punishments as unreal. What has made them say this, is that
	their hearts have become rusty because of their sins; therefore, a
	thing which is thoroughly reasonable appears unreal and unreasonable
	to them. The explanation of this rust as given by the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) is as follows: &quot;When a servant commits a
	sin, it marks a black stain on his heart. If he offers repentance,
	the stain is washed off, but if he persists in wrongdoing. it
	spreads over the whole heart.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i,
	Ibn Majah, Ibn Jarir, Hakim, Ibn Abi Hatim, Ibn Hibban and others).&nbsp;

	meaning of the words khltamu-hu misk is that the vessels containing
	the wine will carry the seal of musk instead of clay or wax.
	Accordingly the verse means: This will be the choicest kind of wine,
	which will be superior to the wine flowing in the canals, and it
	will be served by the attendants of Paradise in vessels sealed with
	musk to the dwellers of Paradise. Another meaning also can be: When
	that wine will pass down the throat, its final effect will be of the
	flavor of musk. This state is contrary to the wines of the world
	which give out an offensive smell as soon as the bottle opens and
	one feels its horrid smell even while drinking and also when it
	passes down the throat.</P>

	the gains and enjoyments of the world and have experienced dangers
	and undergone hardships only for the reason that Muhammad (upon whom
	be Allah's peace and blessings) has deluded them with the Hereafter,
	Heaven and Hell. They are giving up whatever is present and here on
	the false hope that the promise of some Paradise has been held out

	used to persecute the believers, thinking it was an act of virtue.
	In the Hereafter, the believers will be enjoying life in Paradise,
