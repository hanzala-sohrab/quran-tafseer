one sitting at Makkah. Asma, a daughter of Yazid and a first cousin

Surah, the Holy Prophet was riding on a she-camel and I was holding
her nose-string. The she-camel began to feel the weight so heavily
that it seemed as if her bones would break under it.&quot; We also

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
determining the period of its revelation, it is easier to visualize
the background of the Surah. Twelve years had passed since the Holy
Prophet had been inviting the people to Islam. The antagonism and
persecution by the Quraish had become most savage and brutal, and the
majority of the Muslims had to leave their homes and migrate to
Habash (Abyssinia). Above all, the two great supporters of the Holy
Prophet. Abu Talib and Hadrat Khadijah, were no more to help and give
strength to him. Thus he was deprived of all the worldly support. But
in spite of this, he carried on his mission in the teeth of
opposition. As a result of this, on the one hand, all the good people
of Makkah and the surrounding clans gradually began to accept Islam ;
on the other hand, the community as a whole, was bent upon obduracy
and rejection. Therefore, if anyone showed any inclination towards
Islam, he was subjected to taunts and derision, physical violence and
social boycott. It was in these dark circumstances that a ray of hope
gleamed from Yathrib, where Islam began to spread freely by the
efforts of some influential people of Aus and Khazraj, who had
embraced Islam at Makkah. This was a humble beginning in the march of
Islam towards success and none could foresee at that time the great
potentialities that lay hidden in it. For, to a casual observer, it
appeared at that time as if Islam was merely a weak movement it had
no material backing except the meager support of the Prophet's own
family and of the few poor adherents of the Movement. Obviously the
latter could not give much help because they themselves had been cast
out by their own people who had become their enemies and were
persecuting them. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Background of Makki Surahs</FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
this is the first long Makki Surah in the order of the compilation of
the Quran, it will be useful to explain the historical background of
Makki Surahs in general, so that the reader may easily understand the
Makki Surahs and our references to its different stages in connection
with our commentary on them. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First
of all, it should be noted that comparatively very little material is
available in regard to the background of the revelation of Makki
Surahs whereas the period of the revelation of all the Madani Surahs
is known or can be determined with a little effort. There are
authentic traditions even in regard to the occasions of the
revelation of the majority of the verses. On the other hand, we do
not have such detailed information regarding the Makki Surahs. There
are only a few Surahs and verses which have authentic traditions
concerning the time and occasion of their revelation. This is because
the history of the Makki period had not been compiled in such detail
as that of the Madani period. Therefore we have to depend on the
internal evidence of these Surahs for determining the period of their
revelation: for example, the topics they discuss, their subject.
matter, their style and the direct or indirect references to the
events and the occasions of their revelation. Thus it is obvious that
with the help of such evidence as this, we cannot say with precision
that such and such Surah or verse was revealed on such and such an
occasion. The most we can do is to compare the internal evidence of a
Surah with the events of the life of the Holy Prophet at Makkah, and
then come to a more or less correct conclusion as to what particular
stage a certain Surah belongs. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If
we keep the above things in view, the history of the mission of the
Holy Prophet at Makkah can be divided into four stages. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
first stage began with his appointment as a Messenger and ended with
the proclamation of Prophethood three years later. During this period
the Message was given secretly to some selected persons only, but the
common people of Makkah were not aware of it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
second stage lasted for two years after the proclamation of his
Prophethood. It began with opposition by individuals: then by and by,
it took the shape of antagonism, ridicule, derision,, accusation,
abuse, and false propaganda then gangs were formed to persecute those
Muslims who were comparatively poor, weak' and helpless. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
third stage lasted for about six years from the beginning of the
persecution to the death of Abu Talib and Hadrat Khadijah in the
tenth year of Prophethood. During this period, the persecution of the
Muslims became' so savage and brutal that many of them were forced to
migrate to Habash. Social and economic boycott was applied against
the Holy Prophet and the members of his family, and those Muslims who
continued to stay in Makkah were forced to take refuge in
Shi'b-i-A'bi Talib which was besieged. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
fourth stage lasted for about three years from the tenth to the
thirteenth year of Prophethood. This was a period of hard trials and
grievous sufferings for the Holy Prophet and his followers. Life had
become unendurable at Makkah and there appeared to be no place of
refuge even outside it. So much so that when the Holy Prophet went to
Ta'if, it offered no shelter or protection. Besides this, on the
occasion of Haj, he would appeal to each and every Arab clan to
accept his invitation to Islam but met with blank refusal from every
quarter. At the same time, the people of Makkah were holding
counsels' to get rid of him by killing or imprisoning or banishing
him from their city. It was at that most critical time that Allah
opened for Islam the hearts of the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ansar</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

that we have divided the life of the Holy Prophet at Makkah into four
stages, it has become easier for us to tell, as far as possible, the
particular stage in which a certain Makki Sarah was revealed. This is
because the Surahs belonging to a particular stage can be
distinguished from those of the other stages with the help of their
subject matter and style. Besides this, they also contain such
references as throw light on the circumstances and events that form
the background of their revelation. In the succeeding Makki Surahs,
we will determine on the basis of the distinctive features of each
stage, and point out in the Preface, the particular stage in which a
certain Makki Surah was revealed. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Our Messengers only to give good news to the righteous people and to
warn the evil-doers: then those, who accept their Message and reform
their own conduct, will have no cause for fear and sorrow and those

O Muhammad, say, &quot;I have been forbidden to worship those, whom
you invoke beside Allah. &quot; Say, &quot;I will not follow your
wishes for if I did that I should have gone astray, and would not be
of the right guided. &quot; Say, &quot;I take my stand on a clear
proof from my Lord, and you have rejected it. Now, that which you
demand to be hastened is not in my power,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote39anc" HREF="#sdfootnote39sym"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
for Allah alone has the sole authority of passing judgment: He
declares the Truth and He is the best of arbiters&quot; . Say, &quot;Had
I the power to hasten that which you are demanding, the dispute
between you and me would have been settled long before this, but
Allah knows best how to deal with evil-doers. He alone has the keys
of the &quot;unseen&quot;, of which none has the knowledge but He. He
knows all that is in the land and in the sea; there is not a leaf
that falls from a tree but He knows about it; there is not a grain in
the darkest bowels of the earth of which He is not aware; everything
fresh and dry has been recorded in an open Book. It is He Who recalls
your souls at night and knows what you do during the day; then next
day He returns you to your usual work to complete the fixed term of
your life. At long last, you shall all return to Him and He will let
you know what you had been doing. He reigns supreme over His servants
and appoints those, who keep watch over you<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote40anc" HREF="#sdfootnote40sym"><SUP>40</SUP></A>

sent by Him take away his soul and do not show the least negligence

judgment rests with Him alone and He is the swiftest at reckoning.&quot;

shining, he said, &quot;This is my Lord.&quot; But when it also set,
he cried, &quot;If my Lord had not guided me, I, too would have been

Those people formed quite a wrong estimate of Allah, when they said,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote59anc" HREF="#sdfootnote59sym"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
&quot;Allah has not sent down anything to any man.&quot; Ask them:
&quot;Then who sent down the Book, which Moses brought: which was
Light and Guidance for mankind: which you have divided into
fragments, a part of which you show to the people and most of it you
hide from them: by which you were given that knowledge which neither
you nor your forefathers possessed?&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote60anc" HREF="#sdfootnote60sym"><SUP>60</SUP></A>
-- Just say, &quot;Allah&quot;, and then leave them alone to play
with their useless arguments. (Like that Book) this is a Book which
We have sent down; it is a blessed Book, it confirms that which was
sent down before it, and this has been sent down so that you should
warn the people of this central place (Makkah) and those who dwell
around it. Those, who believe in the Hereafter, believe in this Book,
and observe their prescribed Prayers punctually.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote61anc" HREF="#sdfootnote61sym"><SUP>61</SUP></A>
And who could be more wicked than the one who invents a falsehood
about Allah or says, &quot;A Revelation has come to me,&quot; whereas
no Revelation has come to him, or says, &quot;I will also send down
the like of what God has sent down?&quot; Would that you could see
these wicked people, when they are in the agonies of death, and the
angels are out-stretching their hands and saying, &quot;Come, yield
up your soul; today you shall be awarded a disgraceful torment for
the false things you attributed to Allah and for the rebellion you
showed against His Revelations.&quot; (And Allah will add,) &quot;So,
you have come before Us all alone, as We created you at first. Now,
you have left behind all that We gave to you in the world; and now We
do not see with you those intercessors who, you believed, had a share
in molding your destinies: all the relations between you have been
cut off, and all those, in whom you trusted, have left you in the
lurch.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	opportunity to make use of his knowledge for the purpose of
	discovering the Reality, and showing him the signs guiding towards
	it. We daily notice instances of these types. There are millions of
	people before whose eyes countless Signs are spread in their own

	not learn any lessons from them. Then there are the physicists,
	chemists, zoologists, botanists, biologists, geologists,
	astronomers, physiologist, anatomists, historians, archaeologists,
	social scientists, etc., who observe such Signs as may enlighten the
	minds and the hearts with Faith, but they seem to see no &quot;Sign&quot;
	to lead them to the Reality, just because they begin their study
	with prejudiced minds, merely for the sake of material gains. Not
	only this, but every Sign leads them to atheism, disbelief,
	materialism and nature worship. In contrast to them, there are
	those, who observe the wonders of the universe and the phenomena of
	Nature with open eyes and open hearts, and find the Signs of God all

	answer to the demand of the disbelievers for a Sign, they were told
	that there was not one Sign, but innumerable Signs scattered all
	around them and their attention has been drawn in v. 38 to study the
	mystery of the life of any bird or beast and they would find Sign of
	God. Now in v. 40-42, they have been directed to another Sign that
	they can fmd in their own selves. When some affliction befalls a man
	or death confronts him with all its dreads, then he sees no refuge
	in any other than Allah. On such occasions even the most confirmed
	polytheists forget their gods and invoke Allah's help. Likewise the
	most obdurate atheists, in their utter helplessness, involuntary
	pray to Allah for rescue, this Sign-man's own state of mind is being
	presented here as a pointer to the Reality, for this is a clear
	proof of the existence of One God, and of the urge of God-worship
	that has been embedded deep in the heart of every human being.
	Though it might have been kept suppressed by negligence and

	some misfortune.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Ikrimah,
	son of Abu Jahl, who was an arch enemy of Islam, was led towards
	Islam by witnessing such a Sign. When the Holy Prophet conquered
	Makkah, 'Ikrimah fled to Jaddah and sailed for Abyssinia. During the
	voyage, there came a furious storm which threatened to sink the
	boat. At first the passengers began to invoke their gods and
	goddesses for help. But when the storm became so violent that they
	feared that the boat was going to sink. they all cried out, &quot;This
	is not the time to call any open except Allah, because He alone can
	save us. &quot; This opened the eyes of `Ikrimah and the locked
	doors of his heart: &quot;If there is none here except Allah to help
	us, how can there be any to help us in any other place? This is what
	Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) has been teaching us for the
	last twenty years any we have been fighting it out with him&quot;.
	That as the most decisive moment in the life of `Ikrimah. He made a
	solemn pledge with Allah to this effect: &quot;If I escape from this
	storm, I will directly go to Prophet Muhammad Allah's peace be upon
	him) to become a follower of his.&quot; Allah rescued him from that
	storm and he fulfilled his pledge. He not only became a Muslim, but
	spent the rest of his life in the service of Islam by performing
	Jihad.

	absurd objections raised against the claim of Prophethood by
	Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him). The foolish people have always
	had the silly notion that a Prophet of Allah must be supernatural
	and capable of performing wonderful miracles. For instance, they
	expected that a whole mountain should turn into a mass of gold at
	his bidding: that the earth should throw out treasures by his
	orders: that he should be able to tell the people all about their
	past and future: that he should be able to locate a lost thing and
	foretell whether a sick person will get well or die and whether a

	believed that such a person should be above the common human
	limitations. They could not conceive anyone to be a prophet, if he
	suffered from hunger or thirst and needed sleep, or, if he had wife

	from him. They would also raise the objection that he was merely a
	common man, who needed food and drank water like them: who had wife
	and children and who moved about in the bazaars. In answer to these

	suspicion and resorted to litigation on minor grounds. Their prayers
	to their gods generally consisted of supplications for long life,
	prosperity and flourishing business. The population was divided into
	three classes: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	Amelu : This was the highest class which consisted of the priests,
	state officials and military officers, etc. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	Mushkenu : These were the merchants, craftsmen, and farmers. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	Ardu : The slaves. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The Amelu
	class enjoyed special distinctions and privileges: they had greater
	rights both in the criminal and in the civil law than those of other
	people and their life and property were held sacred and precious. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Such was
	the city and the society in which the Prophet Abraham opened his
	eyes. According to the Talmud, he was a member of the Amelu class,
	and his father was the chief official of the state (Please see also
	Al-Baqarah: E.N. 290). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	tablets excavated at Ur mention the names of about 5,000 gods. Each
	city had its own god and also a special deity, who was regarded as
	the chief god or the city god and was entitled to greater reverence
	than the others. The city god of Ur was &quot;Nannar&quot; (the moon
	god) and scholars of the later ages have also called this city
	&quot;Qamrinah&quot; after that god. The other big city was &quot;Larsah&quot;
	which afterwards became the seat of government instead of Ur; its
	chief god was &quot;Shamash&quot; (the sun god). Under these chief
	gods there were many minor gods also, most of whom had been adopted
	from among the stars and planets and a few from among the earthly
	objects. People thought that their prayers for less important things
	were granted by these minor gods. The symbols of all these heavenly
	and earthly gods and goddesses had been formed in the shape of idols
	and all rites of worship were performed before them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The idol
	of &quot;Nannar&quot; had been kept in a grand shrine built on the
	highest peak at Ur and near it the sanctuary of his wife &quot;Ningil&quot;
	had been built. The shrine of &quot;Nannar&quot; was just like a
	royal palace where every night a different female worshiper would go
	and become his bride. Thus there lived a large number of women in
	the shrine who had been dedicated to the god and their position was
	no better than religious prostitutes. The woman who would sacrifice
	her virginity in the name of the &quot;god&quot; was regarded very
	respectable. The common belief was that a women must surrender
	herself at least once in her lifetime to another man &quot;in the
	way of god&quot; in order to attain salvation. It is obvious that
	the people to benefit most from this religious prostitution were the
	male priests themselves. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Nannar&quot;
	was not merely a god; he was the biggest landlord of the country,
	the biggest merchant, the biggest craftsman and the chief executive
	of the country's political life, for a very large number of gardens,
	houses and fields had been dedicated to his shrine. Besides the
	income from these sources, farmers, landlords and merchants also
	brought their offerings of corn, milk, gold, cloth, etc., to the
	shrine. Naturally there was a big staff to look after these
	offerings. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Many
	factories were run and business on a large scale was done on behalf
	of the Temple. The highest court of justice had been established in
	the shrine and the priests acted as judges and their judgments were
	regarded as from &quot;God&quot;. The royal dynasty also derived its
	sovereignty from &quot;Nannar&quot;, who was the real sovereign. The
	king ruled over the country on his behalf and was, therefore,
	himself raised to the rank of a deity and worshiped like the other
	gods. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	dynasty which was ruling over Ur in the time of the Prophet Abraham
	had been founded by Ur-Nammu who in 2300 B.C. had established a vast
	empire, which extended to Susa in the east and to Lebanon in the
	west. It was from him that the dynasty received the title of Nammu
	which became Namrud in Arabic. After the emigration of the Prophet
	Abraham this dynasty and this nation were visited by continuous
	disasters. Their downfall was hastened by the destruction of Ur and
	the capture of Namrud along with the idol of Nannar by the people of
	Elam. Then the Elamis established their rule at Larsah which
	dominated over the land of Ur also. The last blow was dealt by
	Babylon, which had grown powerful under an Arab dynasty and brought
	both Larsah and Ur under its control. As a result of this downfall,
	the people of Ur lost their faith in Nannar who had failed to
	protect them from humiliation, shame and ruin. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Nothing
	can be said with certainty about the response the people of this
	!and made to the teachings of the Prophet Abraham after his
	emigration, but the law promulgated in 1910 B.C. by Hamurabi
	(Amraphel of Gen. xiv), king of Babylon, bears evidence that it had
	been influenced directly or indirectly by the Guidance of
	Prophethood. A pillar inscribed with this complete Code was
	discovered by a French archaeologist in 1902 A.D. and its English
	version was published in 1903 A.D. by C. H. W. John under the title,
	&quot;'The Oldest Code of Law.&quot; Most of the principles and
	details of this Law and the Law of the Prophet Moses, are, in
	general, alike. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If the
	results of the archaeological research, which has been carried out
	so tar, are correct, one thing that clearly stands out is that shirk
	was not merely a religious belief and basis of polytheistic rituals
	with the people of Abraham but it was indeed the very basis of their
	economic, cultural, political and social system of life. In contrast
	to this, the Message of the Prophet Abraham not only clearly struck
	at the root of idol-worship, but also hit hard upon the sovereignty
	and worship of the royal dynasty and the social, economic and
	political status of the priests and nobles and the collective life
	of the whole country. Therefore, the acceptance of his invitation
	had far-reaching implications: It called for a complete
	metamorphosis of the prevailing social pattern and demanded its
	re-construction on the basis of Tauhid. That is why, as soon as the
	Prophet Abraham (Allah's peace be upon him) began to deliver the
	Message, the common people and the nobles, the priest class and
	Nimrod, all stood up together to suppress his voice which gave rise
	to the bitter dispute, mentioned in the Qur'an. &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote53sym" HREF="#sdfootnote53anc">53</A>In
	vv. 76 - 78, the way of thinking which led the Prophet Abraham
	(Allah's peace be upon him) to the Reality before his appointment as
	a Messenger of Allah has been stated. It teaches that if a person
	uses his brain and eyes rightly, he can reach the Reality, even if
	he is born and bred, like Prophet Abraham, in surroundings
	surcharged with shirk in which one might have had no chance of
	learning anything about the Oneness of God. The only condition is
	that one makes the right sort of observation of the phenomena of
	Nature and reflects upon them carefully and exercises one's
	reasoning to reach the truth by a connected, logical train of
	thought. It appears from the preceding verse that the Prophet
	Abraham, from the beginning of his conscious life, was surrounded by
	the people, who worshiped the stars, the moon and the sun. It was,
	therefore, natural that the starting point of his search for the
	truth should be the question: Can any of these objects really be the
	Lord and Sustainer? That is why his thinking centered round this
	question and when he discovered that all the gods of his people were
	bound tightly by an un-alterable law and were revolving in
	accordance with it, he came to the inevitable conclusion that none
	of these gods possessed, in the least, any quality that might
	entitle it to be the Lord. The Lord and Sustainer is only that One,
	Who has created them and bound them to His own obedience. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	wording in which the event has been couched, has generally given
	rise to an objection. &quot;When the night outspread over him, he
	saw a star and said.... I am not one of those who set up partners
	with God. &quot; The question arises in the mind of the common
	reader: Did the night not outspread over Prophet Abraham every day
	of his life ever since he was a child and did he not see the stars,
	the moon and the sun rise and set before this particular occasion?
	Though he saw them every night, it is obvious that he began to
	deliberate like this only when he had attained his maturity. Why has
	then the event been described in such a way (&quot;...... When the
	night outspread over him) as to give rise to the doubt as if he had
	never seen the stars and the moon and the sun ever before this? As
	such an assumption cannot hold good in ordinary circumstances, some
	people have had to invent an extraordinary story to remove this
	seeming anachronism. They say that the Prophet Abraham was born and
	brought up in a cave, where it was arranged that he should not see
	the stars, the moon and the sun before he attained his maturity. The
	matter, however, is so simple that it does not need the invention of
	a fantastic story to explain it. It can be easily understood by a
	well-known incident in the life of Newton. One day when he saw an
	apple fall down from the tree to the ground, his mind suddenly
	turned to the problem: Why do things fall down to the ground? At
	last his deliberation led him to formulate and prove the law of
	gravity. Here, too, the question might arise: Had not Newton ever
	seen anything falling to the ground before this incident? it is
	obvious that he must have seen many things fall to the ground many
	times before this. How is it then, that the fall of that particular
	apple on that particular day stirred up that particular mental
	activity which the daily fall of hundreds of things to the ground
	had not roused before this? The simple answer is that the minds are
	not always excited in the same way by the same kind of observations.
	Many a time, it so happens that one sees a thing over and over again
	but that does not stir up one's mind to any mental activity; then
	there comes a moment when the sight of that very thing diverts the
	mental activity towards a particular problem. Or, if one's mind is
	engaged in the solution of a problem and one suddenly catches sight
	of a particular thing which had always been before one's eyes, it
	excites the mind to a mental activity that helps solve the problem.
	The same thing happened in the case of the Prophet Abraham. Nights
	came and passed away, the stars, the moon and the sun rose and set
	for years, but on one particular night the observation of one
	particular star excited that mental activity which led him to the
	central Reality of the Oneness of God. It may be that ever since he
	attained maturity, he might have been thinking over the problem of
	the worship of the stars, the moon and the sun, because this was the
	religion of his people and on this was based the whole system of the
	life of that community. Then one night the observation of the star
	suddenly excited the mental activity that helped him solve the
	problem. It is also possible that the observation of the star was
	the starting point of that mental activity. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, there is another possible doubt that must also be
	removed. Was the Prophet Abraham guilty of shirk (even though
	temporarily), when seeing the star and the moon and the sun
	severally, he said, &quot;This is my Lord.&quot; A little thinking
	will convince one that he was not at all guilty of shirk for in his
	search for Reality, a seeker-after-truth has, inevitably, to pass
	through several stages of deliberations about shirk. Therefore, what
	determines his creed is not the temporary deliberation but the
	direction of one's research and the ultimate destination where he
	stops. These intervening stages of deliberation have to be made by
	every seeker-after-truth in his search for Reality. These are made
	for the sake of research and should not be taken as the final
	decision. The deliberation about any form of shirk is in a
	questioning manner and is not its practice. When a
	seeker-after-truth stops to deliberate about anything and says, &quot;It
	is so,&quot; it is not his final judgment. What he means to say is,
	&quot;Is it so?&brvbar; That is why he proceeds further in his
	research as soon as he gets a negative answer at any of these
	stages. &nbsp;

	have already explained in E.N. 73 above the fact of this matter, but
	the fine distinction between Allah's &quot;will&quot; (mashiyat) and
	His approval (rada) should also be kept in mind; otherwise there
	might arise very serious misunderstandings. It must be clearly
	understood that nothing whatsoever can happen without the &quot;will&quot;
	and permission of Allah, for no incident can happen, unless Allah
	makes room for it in His vast scheme and provides means for its
	happening. But it does not necessarily mean that Allah also.
	approves of and is pleased with that incident. For instance, no
	thief can commit theft, no murderer can kill, no tyrant can be
	tyrannical, no breaker of peace can cause disorder, no unbeliever
	can disbelieve and no mushrik can commit shirk, etc., etc., without
	the &quot;Will&quot; of Allah. Likewise, no believer can have Faith
	and no pious person can be pious unless it be the &quot;Will&quot;
	of Allah; yet He is not pleased with the first kind of bad deeds,
	whereas He is pleased with and approves of and likes the second kind
	of good deeds. It is true that the &quot;Will&quot; of Allah is
	working for an ultimate great good, but that can only come about by
	means of a conflict between light and darkness, good and bad, peace
	and disorder. Therefore, He allows, for the sake of His great good
	designs, the necessary freedom both to the powers of obedience and
	to those of disobedience, of piety and sin, of Prophethood and the
	forces of evil, so that both might be allowed to perform the deeds
	of their own choice and to those of His creatures (men and jinn) who
	have been delegated with a limited authority and the consequent
	responsibility. Everyone is free to make a choice of good deeds or
	of bad deeds for himself in this world. Both the good and the bad
	people are allowed to have the necessary means, as far as it suits
	and fits into the Divide Design, but only those who make a choice of
	good works merit His pleasure and approval, for Allah likes that His
	servants should make the right use of their freedom of choice and
	adopt good instead of evil. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, it will be worthwhile to understand why Allah mentions
	over and over again that it is by His &quot;Will&quot; that the
	enemies of Truth have been allowed to carry on their nefarious
	activities. This is to impress upon the Holy Prophet, and through
	him on his followers, that the nature of their work is different
	from that of the angels, who carry out the Commands of Allah without
	meeting with any resistance. Their Mission, requires that in their
	conflict with the wicked and rebellious people, they should exert
	their utmost to make the Way of Allah dominant over their ways. That
	is why it is the &quot;Will&quot; of Allah to allow such people as
	have deliberately chosen the way of rebellion against Allah to exert
	their worst in pursuance of their choice. Likewise, He allows the`
	Believers also full opportunity to exert their utmost in the service
	and obedience of Allah that they have deliberately chosen. Though He
	is pleased with and gives His help and succor to the Believers and
	guides them to the Right Way because they do the deeds He likes them
	to do, yet they should not expect that Allah will force, by His
	supernatural intervention, the unbelievers to believe, if they do
	not want to believe by their free choice; or that He will remove by
	force from their way those satans amongst men and jinn who have
	deliberately chosen to use all the powers of their hearts and minds
	and bodies against the Truth in order to block its way. They should
	note it well that, if they sincerely intend to work for the cause of
	truth, virtue and righteousness, they will have to prove this by
	putting up hard struggle and exerting their utmost in their conflict
	with the worshipers of falsehood. If Allah had willed to demolish
	falsehood and make the Truth dominate by miracles, there was no need
	to entrust this work to the Believers for in that case He Himself
	could have arranged the things so as to leave no satan in the world
	and no room for shirk and disbelief to make their appearance.

	because He was their Creator as well. But at the same time, they

	family or clan, for they believed that Allah showed His kindness to
	them, because their gods, goddesses, angels, jinn, stars and the
	souls of their dead ancestors interceded with Him in their behalf.
	They also expected that in this way they would continue their

	task for the iniquity they were committing, so as to say, &quot;It
	is sheer ingratitude that you are making offerings to others of the
	things that I have created and given you with My own mercy and

	their own presumptions .This is because they have become their own
	law-makers and assign to Allah and to others whatever share they
	deem proper , when in fact ,Allah is the real giver of everything.
	Therefore, the portion to be assigned to Him in gratitude should be
	determined by His Law, which should also decide the shares of the

	assigned to Allah happened to go to the other side, but would return
	it, if anything happened to go to the share of Allah from the share
	of their gods. In case of drought, if they were forced to make use

	case, they would not take even the smallest thing from the share of
	their gods to make up for the deficiency in Allah's share. Obviously

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let

	lawful. But there are several Traditions to the effect that the Holy
	Prophet prohibited other animals besides these four or held them in
	detestation, e.g., domestic donkeys and fanged beasts of prey and
	birds with claws. Therefore most jurists do not consider the
	prohibition to be confined to these four things only, but extend it
	to others; then there is also a difference of opinion among the
	jurists about the prohibition or otherwise of certain animals. For
	instance, Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik and Imam Shafi`i declare the
	domestic donkey to be unlawful, but there are others who assert that
	the domestic donkey, is not unlawful and say that it was prohibited
	by the Holy Prophet on one occasion only for some special reason.
	The Hanafi s consider the carnivorous beasts and birds of prey and
	the animals that live on dead flesh to be absolutely unlawful, but
	according to Imam Malik and Auza`i, the birds of prey are lawful and
	Laith considers the cat to be lawful. According to Imam Shafi i.
	only those carnivorous beasts are unlawful that (like the lion,
	wolf, tiger) attack man. According to ' Ikrimah, the crow and the
	badger are both lawful. Then according to the Hanafi s, all crawling
	creatures are unlawful, whereas Ibn AbiLaila, Imam Malik and Auza' i

	and that there are certain other animal foods that are detestable in
	various degrees. Therefore those things, which according to
	authentic Traditions were held in detestation by the Holy Prophet,
	are almost unlawful, but those things about which there is a
	difference of opinion among the jurists, their detestation is
	doubtful. As far as personal detestation of certain things by some
	people is concerned, the Islamic Law does not compel anyone to eat
	what one dislikes. The same applies to the detestation of certain
	things by some groups or nations. Conversely, the Law does not allow
	any person or community or nation to force others to consider as
	unlawful anything that they detest, or to .prohibit its use to those
	who consider them unlawful.

	certain things were made unlawful for them as punishment for their
	rebellion has been mentioned in the Qur'an at three places: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) &quot;All
	the articles of food, which are lawful in the Muhammadan Law, were
	also lawful for the children of Israel, except those which Israel
	had forbidden for himself before the Torah was sent down. Say to
	them, Bring the Torah and read out any passage from it (in support
	of your objection), if you are in the right. &quot; (Al- `Imran,
	111): 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) &quot;It
	is because of the criminal attitude of those who became Jews......
	that We had made unlawful many pure things which were formerly
	lawful for them&quot;. (An-Visa' IV:160) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) Here
	in this Surah, in verse 146. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From the
	above three verses, we conclude that the difference between the
	Muhammadan and the Jewish Laws in regard to the legality or
	otherwise of animal food is based on two things. First, centuries
	before the revelation of the Torah, the Prophet Jacob (Israel) had
	given up the use of several things, and after him, his offspring
	also did the same. This went on for such a long time that the
	jurists of the Jewish Law began to believe that those things were
	unlawful in their religion. Accordingly, they inserted in the Torah
	the prohibition of those things, the three of which were the camel,
	the hare and the Coney. That is why the Torah, as contained in the
	existing Bible prohibits their eating. (Levit. 11: 4-6 and Deut.
	14:7). But, the open challenge of the Qur'an to them to bring the
	Torah in proof thereof shows that the commandments referred to above
	did not exist in the Torah at that time and were inserted
	afterwards; otherwise the Jews would have at once accepted the
	challenge of the Qur'an and presented the commandments thereof. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second difference between the two laws was caused by the rebellious
	attitude of the Jews against the Divine Law. They became their own
	law-makers and made many things unlawful by their hair-splitting and
	Allah let them remain involved in that misunderstanding as a
	punishment. These things comprise two categories : (1) Animals with
	claws such as the ostrich, the cuckoo, the swan, etc., and (2) the
	fat of the cow and the goat, etc. Afterwards both kinds of
	&quot;prohibitions&quot; were incorporated in the existing Torah.
	(Levit. 11 : 16-18, Deut. 14 : 14-17, Levit. 3 : 17, 7 : 22-23). But
	it is obvious from An - Nisa, IV : 160 that at first these things
	were not unlawful i the Torah, but were made so after the Prophet
	Jesus Christ. History also bears evidence that the existing Jewish
	Law was formulated by Rabbi Judas at the end of the second century
	of the Christian Era. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the objection that might arise regarding the above
	explanation. If these things were made unlawful in the manner
	explained above, why has, then, Allah used the word harramna (&quot;We
	prohibited&quot;) here in verse 130 and in verse 160 of An-Nisa In
	considering the objection, we should keep in mind the two ways in
	which things are made unlawful by Allah. (1) He prohibits a thing
	through a Messenger and a Book, and this is the blessing from Him.
	(2) He sets false religious law-givers and counterfeit law-makers
	over His rebellious servants and they declare pure things as
	unlawful. As such a prohibition' is the curse of God and a
	punishment from Him, it has been attributed to Him.&nbsp;

	order to understand the significance of this decisive answer to
	their lame excuse, let us analyze it: (1) It warns: &quot;The `will
	of God' has always been made an excuse by the criminals of all ages
	to justify their wicked acts and erroneous conduct. This misled them
	so much that they rejected the Truth and consequently met with ruin
	that overtakes those who fight against the Truth.&quot; (2) &quot;The
	excuse which you are putting forward is not based on knowledge but
	on conjecture and guess-work. The whole of your argument is based on
	hearsay about the will of Allah. You do not understand the meaning
	of `the will of Allah' in regard to man. Therefore you wrongly
	believe that if a thief commits theft he is not to be regarded as a
	thief, because he had done this under `the will of Allah. Its real
	meaning is that Allah will open for a man whatever way he would
	choose for himself -- the way of gratitude or ingratitude, guidance
	or deviation, obedience or disobedience. Then Allah will let the man
	do anything, good or bad, he chooses, and will provide for its
	fulfillment the means that fit in His vast universal designs.
	Therefore if you and your forefathers were allowed to commit shirk
	and declare lawful things unlawful under the will of Allah, they had
	to bear its consequences, for it does not mean that Allah approved
	of these things. Likewise you shall be responsible and accountable
	for your wrong choice and for your evil intentions and wicked
	deeds.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The last
	sentence, &quot;..... had Allah so willed, He would have shown
	guidance to all of you,&quot; settles the issue decisively. It
	implies: &quot;Your argument, `had Allah willed, we would not have
	committed shirk,' is incomplete. The complete thing will be this:
	`Had Allah willed, He would have shown guidance to all of us.&quot;
	In other words, &quot;You yourselves do not intend to choose the
	right way, but you desire that Allah should make you inherently
	righteous like angels. You should, however, note it well, that Allah
	could have done so if He had so willed. But this is not His will.
	Therefore He will let you go astray on the wrong way that you
	yourselves have chosen to follow.&quot;

	them introduced new things into it, others made changes in it to
	suit their lusts; still others mixed things in it because of their
	exaggerated reverence. Then they tampered with its creed by mixing
	with it their whims, their speculations and their philosophies. They
	changed it also by adding to its commandments their innovations and
	their self-made laws and by corrupting its regulations by
	hair-splitting and exaggerating the differences in its details and
	by rendering important things unimportant and vice versa. They went
	to two extremes: they adored some Prophets too much and opposed and
	rejected others. In this way numerous new religions and sects came
	into existence and divided humanity into fighting groups. Therefore
	it is essential for a follower of the True Religion to have nothing
	to do with any of these sects and to keep his own path clear of
	them.

	&quot;Abraham's Way&quot; has been used because both the Jews and
	the Christians acknowledged Abraham as a true Prophet. They also
	knew it well that he died long before the births of Judaism and
	Christianity. The Arab mushrikin also could not deny that his &quot;Way&quot;
	was the Right Way, for they believed that he was a righteous man and
	in spite of their ignorance, they had to acknowledge that the

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	each and every thing in the universe belongs to Allah and all human
	beings are His vicegerents on the earth in the sense that He has
	entrusted many of His things to them and delegated powers to exploit
	them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) That
	Allah has ascribed different ranks to His vicegerents in regard to
	the trusts. He has entrusted some with a large number of His things,
	while others with a small number and endowed some with a greater
	capacity for work than others. Likewise there is a difference in the
	powers He has delegated to them: nay, he has even given powers to
	some human beings over other human beings. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) That
	this worldly life is merely a test and all the things and powers
	that have been given as trusts are the means of the test. An
	accurate record is being kept of how each man is making use of his
	trust and how far he is exploiting these things in accordance with
	the terms of the trust and how he is using or abusing his abilities,
	capabilities, etc. in this regard. The result of his test will
	determine man's rank in the Next World.
