<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
it some of the evils prevalent among the materialistic hoarders of
wealth in the pre-Islamic days have been condemned. Every Arab knew
that they actually existed in their society; they regarded them as
evils and nobody thought they were good. After calling attention to
this kind of ugly character, the ultimate end in the Hereafter of the
people having this kind of character has been stated. Both these
things (i.e. the character and his fate in the Hereafter) have been
depicted in a way which makes the listener automatically reach the
conclusion that such a man fitly deserves to meet such an end. And
since in the world, people of such character do not suffer any
punishment, but seem to be thriving instead, the occurrence of the
Hereafter becomes absolutely inevitable. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If
this Surah is read in the sequence of the Surahs beginning with
Az-Zilzal, one can fully well understand how the fundamental beliefs
of Islam and its teachings were impressed on the peoples minds in the
earliest stage in Makkah. In Surah Az-Zilzal, it was said that in the
Hereafter man's full record will be placed before him and not an
atom's weight of good or evil done by him in the world will have been
left unrecorded. In Surah Al-Adiyat, attention was drawn to the
plunder and loot, bloodshed and vandalism, prevailing in Arabia
before Islam; then making the people realize, that the way the powers
given by God were being abused, was indeed an expression of sheer
ingratitude to Him, they were told that the matter would not end up
in the world, but in the second life after death not only their deeds
but their intentions and motives too would be examined, and their
Lord fully well knows which of them deserves what reward or
punishment. In Surah Al-Qariah after depicting Resurrection the
people were warned that in the Hereafter a man's good or evil end
will be dependent on whether the scale of his good deeds was heavier,
or the scale of his evil deeds was heavier:In Surah At-Takathur the
people were taken to task for the materialistic mentality because of
which they remained occupied in seeking increase in worldly benefits,
pleasures, comforts and position, and in vying with one another for
abundance of everything until death overtook them. Then, warning them
of the evil consequences of their heedlessness, they were told that
the world was not an open table of food for then to pick and choose
whatever they pleased, but for every single blessing that they were
enjoying in the world, they would have to render an account to their
Lord and Sustainer as to how they obtained it and how they used it.
In Surah Al-Asr it was declared that each member, each group and each
community of mankind, even the entire world of humanity, was in
manifest loss, if its members were devoid of Faith and righteous
deeds and of the practice of exhorting others to truth and patience.
Immediately after this comes Surah Al-Humazah in which after
presenting a specimen of leadership of the pre-Islamic age of
ignorance, the people have been asked the question: &quot;What should
such a character deserve if not loss and perdition?&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>The
	words used in the original are humazat il-lumazah. In Arabic hamz
	and lamz are so close in meaning that they are sometimes used as
	synonyms and sometimes with a little difference in the shade of
	meaning. But this difference is not definite and clear, for the
	meaning given to lamz by some Arabic speaking people themselves is
	given to lamz by other Arabic speaking peoples. On the contrary, the
	meaning given to harm by some people is given to hamz by others.
	Here, since both the words appear together and the words humazat
	il-lumazat have been used, they give the meaning that it has become
	a practice with the slanderer that he insults and holds others in
	contempt habitually. He raises his finger and winks at one man,
	finds fault with the lineage and person of another, taunts one in
	the face and backbites another; creates differences between friends
	and stirs up divisions between brothers; calls the people names and
	satirizes and defames them.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>This
	second sentence after the first sentence by itself gives the meaning
	that he slanders others because of his pride of wealth. The words
	jama `a malan for collecting money suggest the abundance of wealth;
	then the words &quot;counting it over and over again&quot; depict
	the person's miserliness and his selfish hoarding of wealth.&nbsp;

	meaning also can be: &quot;He thinks that his wealth will make him
	immortal.&quot; That is, he is so engrossed in amassing wealth and

	never bothers to consider that a time will come when he will have to

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>The
	word in the original is la yrtnbadhanna. Nabdh in Arabic is used for
	throwing away a thing regarding it as worthless and mean. This by
	itself indicates that because of his wealth he thinks that he is a
	great man but on the Day Of Resurrection he will be hurled into Hell
	as a mean and contemptible object.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>The
	word hutamah in the original is from hatm, which means to smash,
	crush and break into pieces. Hell has been described by this epithet
	because it will crush and break to pieces whatever is thrown into it
	because of its depth and its fire.</P>

	else in the Qur'an has the fire of Hell been called the fire of
	Allah. Here, its ascription to Allah not only expresses its
	dreadfulness but it also shows how the wrath and contempt of Allah
	envelops those who become proud and arrogant with the worldly
	wealth. That is why Allah has described that fire as His own Fire
	into which they will be hurled.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote7sym" HREF="#sdfootnote7anc">7</A>Tattali'u
	is from ittala a, which means to climb and mount to the top, and
	also to be aware and informed. Afidah is plural of fuwad, which
	means the heart. But this word is not used for the organ which
	throbs in the breast, but for the seat of man's understanding and
	consciousness, his'feelings and desires, beliefs and thoughts,
	motives and intentions, Thus, one meaning of the rising of the fire
	to the hearts is that this. fire will reach the place which is the
	center of man's evil thoughts, false beliefs, impure desires and
	feelings, and wicked motives and intentions. The second meaning is
	that the Fire of Allah will not be blind like the tire of the world,
	which burns up the deserving and the non-deserving alike, but it
	will reach the heart of every culprit and discover the nature of his
	crime and then punish him according to his guilt.&nbsp;
