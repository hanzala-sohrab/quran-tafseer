<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>There
are clear indications in the subject matter of this Surah to the
conditions in which it was revealed. The disbelievers of Makkah at
that time were engaged in two kinds of the activities against the
Holy Prophet. First, they were creating every kind of suspicion and
misgiving in the minds of the people about the teaching of the Quran
and the message of Islam and about the Holy Prophet himself by
starting many disputes and discussions, raising irrelevant objections
and bringing ever new accusations so that the Holy Prophet and the
believers were sick of trying to answer them. Second, they were
preparing the ground for putting an end to the Holy Prophet himself.
They were devising one plot after the other, and on one occasion had
even taken the practical steps to execute a plot. Bukhari has related
a tradition on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin Amr bin 'As
saying that one day when the Holy Prophet was offering his Prayer in
the precinct's of the Kabbah, suddenly 'Uqbah bin Abi Mu'ait, rushed
forward and putting a piece of cloth round his neck started twisting
it so as to strangle him to death. Hadrat Abu Bakr, who happened to
go there in time, pushed him away. Hadrat Abdullah says that when Abu
Bakr was struggling with the cruel man, he was saying words to the
effect: &quot;Would you kill a man only because he says: Allah is my
Lord?&quot; With a little variation this event has also been
mentioned in Ibn Hisham, Nasa'i and Ibn Abi Hatim . </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) and his followers have
	been taught the lesson: &quot;These wicked people may apparently be
	very strong and powerful and you very weak and helpless against
	them, yet you should rest assured that the might of that God Whose
	Word you are trying to raise high is superior to every other power.
	Therefore, you should only seek Allah's refuge in response to every
	and any dreadful threat that they utter against you, and then busy
	yourself after this in fearlessly performing your mission. The
	God-worshiper has only one answer to every threat of the tyrant: `I
	have taken refuge in my Lord and your Lord against every arrogant
	person who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.' (v. 27) Thus,
	if you go on performing your mission fearless of every danger and
	with full trust in God, His succor will ultimately reach you, and
	the Pharaohs of today shall be doomed just as the Pharaohs of
	yesterday. Till that time you will have to face and bear patiently

	society, who had been convinced in their hearts that the Truth was
	only on the side of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
	peace), and that the disbelieving Quraish were being unjust and
	cruel. But in spite of the conviction they were watching quietly and
	unconcerned the conflict between the Truth and falsehood. Allah here
	has aroused their conscience as if to say: &quot;When the enemies of
	the Truth have openly plotted, in front of your very eyes, it would
	be a sad reflection on you if you still remained indifferent. Under
	such conditions, unless a person's conscience has wholly become
	dead, he should rise and perform the duty, which a righteous man
	from among the courtiers of Pharaoh himself had performed at a time
	when the Pharaoh had made up his mind to kill the Prophet Moses. The
	circumstances that prevent you from raising your voice had also
	obstructed the way of the Believer, but he had full faith in Allah
	and disregarded all expediency; then note that the Pharaoh was not
	able to do him any harm.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

the real basis of the dispute between the Holy Prophet and the
disbelievers, and it has been stated plainly and openly that the
disbelievers are wrangling over those truths without any knowledge.
On the other, the motives which were the real cause of the Quraishite
chiefs' conflict against the Holy Prophet, have been exposed.
Apparently they were trying to have the common people believe that
they had some genuine objections against the teaching of the Prophet
and his claim to prophethood; that is why they were not prepared to
listen to him. But, in fact, this was their struggle for power. In
verse 56, they have been openly warned, so as to say&quot; &quot;The
real cause of your denial is your arrogance and vanity. You think
that if you acknowledge the prophethood of Muhammad (upon whom be
Allah's peace), your power and authority will come to an end. That is

<DIV ID="sdfootnote1">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>This
	is the introduction to the discourse. By this the listener has been
	forewarned to the effect: &brvbar;What is being presented before
	you, is not the word of an ordinary being but of that God Who has
	infinite power.&quot; After this, some of Allah's attributes have
	been mentioned, one after the other, which bear a deep relevance to
	the following theme: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that He is &quot;All-Mighty&quot;, i.e. He is Dominant over
	everything. His every decree concerning anybody is always enforced;
	none can fight Him and win; none can escape His grasp. Therefore, a
	person who expects to be successful after turning away from His
	Command and expects to frustrate His Message after having a dispute
	with Him is himself foolish. Such notions are only deceptions. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second,
	that He is &quot;All-Knowing&quot;, i.e. He does not say anything on
	mere conjecture, but has the direct knowledge of everything.
	Therefore, whatever information He gives about the supernatural
	realities, is lure, and the one who does not accept it, is following
	nothing but ignorance. Likewise, He knows in what lies the true
	success of man and what rules and laws and commands are necessary
	for his well-being. His every teaching is based on wisdom and
	correct knowledge, which does not admit of any error. Therefore, if
	a person does not accept His guidance, he only wants to follow the
	path of his own ruin. Then, nothing from the acts and deeds of man
	can remain hidden from Him; so much so that He even knows the
	intentions of man, which arc the real motives of his deeds.
	Therefore, man can never escape His punishment. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	attribute is that He is &quot;Forgiver of sin and Acceptor of
	repentance. &quot; This attribute brings hope and causes inducement,
	which has been mentioned so that the people who have led lives of
	sin, should not despair but should reform themselves with the hope
	that if they refrained from their behavior even now, they could
	still be redeemed by Allah's mercy. Here, one should understand well
	that forgiving of sins and accepting of repentance are not
	necessarily one and the same thing, but in most cases Allah forgives
	sins even without the repentance. For example, a person commits
	errors as well as does good, and his good acts become the means of
	forgiveness for his mistakes, whether or not he had opportunity to
	show repentance for the errors, but might even have forgotten them.
	Likewise, all the troubles and hardships and diseases and calamities
	that afflict man and cause him grief in the world, serve as penance
	for his mistakes. That is why mention of forgiveness of sins has
	been made separately from the acceptance of repentance. But one
	should remember that the concession of forgiveness of errors without
	repentance only refers to those believers, who are free from
	defiance and who committed sins due to human weakness and not
	persistence in pride and sin. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	fourth attribute is that &quot;He is stern in punishment.&quot; By
	this the people have been warned that just as Allah is Merciful for
	those who adopt the way of His service, so He is stern for those who
	adopt an attitude of rebellion against Him. When a person (or
	persons) transgresses the limits where he can still deserve pardon
	and forgiveness from Allah, then he becomes worthy of His
	punishment, and His punishment is so dreadful that only a fool would
	persist in his wrongdoing. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The fifth
	attribute is that &quot;He is Bountiful&quot;, i.e. He is Generous
	and Beneficent: all creatures are being showered with His blessings
	and favors every moment: whatever the servants are getting, they are
	getting only through His bounty and beneficence. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After
	these five attributes, two realities have been stated expressly: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	none but Allah is the Deity no matter how many false gods the people
	might have set up; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	to Him everyone must return: there is no other deity which can call
	the people to account and reward or punish them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Therefore,
	if somebody makes another his deity, apart from Him, he will himself
	face the consequences of his folly.&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote2">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>&quot;To
	dispute&quot; means using crooked arguments in reasoning, raising
	irrelevant objections, isolating a word or a sentence from its
	context, subjecting it to hair-splitting and making it the basis of
	doubts and accusations, misconstruing words from their true sense
	and intention so that neither should one understand the meaning
	oneself nor let others understand it. Such a way of dispute is
	adopted only by those whose difference of opinion is based on
	ill-will and malice. If a well-intentioned opponent disputes a
	point, he does so for the sake of arriving at the truth, and wants
	to be satisfied through discussion whether his own point of view is
	correct. Such a discussion is engaged in quest of truth and not for
	refutation. Contrary to this, the real purpose of the malicious
	opponent is not to understand anything nor to help others to
	understand, but to degrade and humiliate the other man; he joins a
	discussion only with the intention that he would not let the other
	man carry his point. That is why he never faces the real problems
	but launches his attacks only on the irrelevant issues.&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>Here,
	the word kufr&quot; has been used in two meanings: for ingratitude
	and for denial of the truth. According to the first meaning, the
	sentence would mean: As against the Revelations of Allah this sort
	of behavior is adopted only by those who have forgotten His bounties
	and who have even lost the feeling that it is by His bounty that
	they are flourishing. According to the second, it would mean: &quot;This
	sort of behavior is adopted only by those who have turned away from
	the truth and are determined not to accept it. &quot; From the
	context it becomes obvious that here the disbeliever does not imply
	every non-Muslim, for a non-Muslim who disputes a point in good
	faith for the sake of understanding Islam, and who tries to grasp
	thoroughly those things which he fends hard to follow, although a
	non Muslim technically, yet that which has been condemned in this
	verse does not apply to him.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote4">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>There
	is a gap between the previous sentence and this, which has been left
	for the listener to fill. From the context and style it becomes
	evident that those who adopt the attitude of disputation as against
	the Revelations of Allah Almighty, can never escape the punishment.
	Therefore, they shall inevitably meet their doom. Now, if one sees
	that those people, even after adopting such an attitude, arc
	strutting about, their business is flourishing, their governments
	functioning in a grand style. and they are enjoying the good things
	of life, one should not be misled into thinking that they have
	escaped Allah's punishment, or that war against Allah's Revelations
	is a sport which can be adopted as a pastime and its evil
	consequences warded off easily. This, in fact, is a respite which
	they have been granted by Allah. Those who abuse this respite for
	doing more mischief arc indeed preparing for an ignominious end.&nbsp;

</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote5">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>That
	is, `The torment that seized them in the world was not their final
	punishment, but Allah has also decreed that they shall go to Hell.'
	Another meaning can be: &quot;Just as the nations of the past have
	gone to their doom, so will those people also who arc committing
	disbelief go to Hell, according to the fixed decree of Allah.&quot;</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote6">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote6sym" HREF="#sdfootnote6anc">6</A>This
	thing has been said for the consolation of the Holy Prophet's
	Companions, who were feeling greatly discouraged at the impudence
	and rebellious attitude of the disbelievers of Makkah as against
	their own helplessness, as if to say: Why do you feel grieved at
	what these mean and worthless people say? You have the support of
	the angels who bear the Divine Throne and of those who stand around
	it; they are interceding with Allah for you.&quot; The mention of
	the angels who bear the Divine Throne and of those who stand around
	it, has been made, instead of the common angels, to impress the fact
	that not to speak of the common angels of Divine Kingdom, even the
	angels who are the pillars of this Kingdom, being nearest in rank
	and station to Allah, bear deep sympathy and regard for you. Then
	the words: &brvbar;They affirm faith in Him and ask forgiveness for
	the believers&quot;, show that the relationship of the faith is the
	real relationship, which has joined the heavenly creatures and the
	earthly creatures together, and which has induced sympathy and
	esteem in the angels stationed around the Throne for the mortal
	humans inhabiting the earth, who affirm faith in Allah just like
	them. The angels' affirming the faith in Allah does not mean that
	they could disbelieve, and they adopted belief instead of disbelief,
	but it means that they believe in the sovereignty of Allah, the One,
	alone there is no other being that may be commanding them and they
	submit before it in utter obedience. When the same attitude and
	behavior was adopted by the human believers, a strong relationship
	of cherishing a common creed and faith was established between them
	and the angels in spite of the great disparity in species and
	remoteness in rank and station.&nbsp;

	of the Prophet Moses' story, as given in the Qur'an, it becomes
	obvious as to what were those Signs which are being described here
	as 'a clear authority of his appointment&quot; as a Prophet by
	.Allah. In the first place, even this was strange that a person who,
	a few years earlier, had fled the country after killing a man of
	Pharaoh's nation and whose warrants of arrest had been issued,
	should make a sudden appearance directly in the fill-packed coup of
	Pharaoh, with a staff in hand, and should boldly and fearlessly
	address the king and his nobles and demand that they should
	acknowledge him as the representative of Allah, Lord of the worlds,
	and should act according to what he says, and none dares to lay iris
	hands on him. whereas the nation to which Moses belonged, had been
	so suppressed under slavery that if he had been apprehended
	immediately on the charge of murder, no one would have voiced even a
	protest, not to speak of rising in rebellion. This shows that
	Pharaoh and his courtiers had been awe-inspired just at the
	appearance of the Prophet Moses, even before they witnessed the
	miracles of the staff and the shining hand, and they had realized in
	the very beginning that he had some greater power behind him, Then
	each of the wonderful miracles that he performed, one after the
	other, was enough to bring about the conviction that it was not a
	manifestation of magic but of Divine Power. After all, what power of
	magic could cause a staff to change into a serpent? or cause a whole
	country to suffer from famine? or cause different sorts of disasters
	to strike vast areas of the land on a sudden notice by Moses and be
	removed on a notice by him? That is why. according to the Qur'an,
	Pharaoh and all the responsible people of his kingdom had been
	convinced in their hearts, whether they might be refusing to profess
	with the tongue, that Moses had indeed been appointed a Prophet by
	Allah. (For details, see Al-A'raf: 106-117; Ta Ha: 56 78;

	Kuranic story of a believer at the court of Pharaoh who wants to

	they must find fault with everything that the Qur'an presents. Now,
	if they do not find any ground for criticising a statement of it,
	they should at least say this much out of mischief that the story is
	not entirely clear, and also should incidentally create this doubt
	in the reader's mind that the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
	peace) might have heard from somewhere the story of Jethro mentioned
	in the Haggada taking place even before the birth of Prophet Moses,
	and inserted it here in this form. This is the type of literary
	research&quot; which these people have adopted with regard to Islam
	and the Qur'an and the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's

	and economic system that was prevalent in Egypt on the basis of
	Pharaoh's and his family's sovereignty, and Pharaoh was afraid that
	Moses' message would change that very din. But like the cunning and
	deceitful rulers of every age he also did not say that he feared
	being deposed from his position of authority and, therefore, he
	wanted to kill Moses, but he presented the case like this: &quot;O
	people, the danger is for you, not for me; for if Moses' movement
	succeeded your din would change. I am not worried for myself: I am
	worried for your sake as to what would become of you when you have

	presence, and the Prophet might have given this direct answer there
	and then, addressing him and his courtiers. The other probability is
	that Pharaoh might have expressed this intention in the absence of
	Moses in a meeting with the responsible people of his government and
	a report of this conversation might have been conveyed to the
	Prophet by some of the believers, whereupon he might have said these
	words in some gathering of his followers. Whatever be the case, it
	is apparent from the words that the threat of Pharaoh could not
	cause any state of fear in Moses' heart and with trust in Allah he
	flung his threat back at Pharaoh. The context in which this event
	has been related in the Qur'an by itself shows that the same also
	was the reply from the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's

	Reckoning, were devising plots to kill him.&nbsp;

	opposition. Though this desire in itself was not a sin, which should
	have called for repentance, the high rank with which Allah had
	blessed the Holy Prophet demanded great grit and will power; so the
	little impatience shown by him was regarded as inconsistent with his
	high rank. Therefore, he was required to ask Allah's forgiveness for
	showing the weakness and was told to stand his ground like a rock as
	a man of a high rank like him should.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote83">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote83sym" HREF="#sdfootnote83anc">83</A>That
	is, &quot;all the powers to answer our prayers vest in Me only; so
	you should not pray to others but pray to Me.&quot; To understand
	the spirit of this verse well, three points should be comprehended
	properly: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	man prays only to that being whom he regards as all-Hearing and
	all-Seeing and Possessor of supernatural powers. And the real motive
	of prayer for man is the internal feeling that the natural means and
	resources of the material world are not enough to remove any of his
	troubles and to fulfill any of his needs, or are not proving to be
	enough, Therefore, it is inevitable that he should turn to a being
	who is possessor of supernatural powers and authority. Man invokes
	that Being even without having seen Him; he invokes Him at all
	tithes, at all places, and under all circumstances; he invokes Him
	in solitude, aloud as well as in a low voice, and even in the depths
	of his heart. He does so inevitably on the basis of the belief that
	that Being is watching him everywhere, is also hearing whatever he
	has in his heart, and possesses such absolute powers that, it can
	come to the help of the supplicant wherever he is, and can help him
	out of every trouble and difficulty. After having known this truth
	about the prayer, it remains no longer difficult for man to
	understand that the one who invokes another than Allah for help,
	commits shirk absolutely and purely and clearly, for he believes
	those attributes to be belonging to the other being, which only
	belong to Allah. Had he not believed the other being to be an
	associate of Allah in the Divine attributes, he would never have
	even thought of invoking it for help. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second,
	one should. fully understand that man's merely thinking about a
	being that it is the possessor of powers and authority, does not
	necessitate that it should actually become possessor of the powers
	and authority. Being possessor of powers and authority is a factual
	matter, which is not dependent on somebody's understanding or not
	understanding it. The one who is actually the Possessor of the
	powers will in any case remain the Possessor whether man regards Him
	so or not. And the one who is not in reality the possessor, will not
	be able to have any share whatever in the powers only because man
	has believed it to be possessing the powers Now, the fact of the
	matter is that the Being Who is all-Powerful, all-Hearing,
	All-Seeing, and Who is actually controlling the whole Universe is
	only Allah, and He alone is Possessor of all powers and authority.
	There is none else in this Universe, who may have any power to hear
	the prayers and to answer them or reject them. As against this
	factual matter if some people of themselves start entertaining the
	belief that some prophets, saints, angels, jinns, planets or
	imaginary gods also are share-holders in the powers, the reality
	will not change in any way whatever. The Owner will remain the Owner
	and the helpless servants the servants. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly,
	the one who invokes others than Allah behaves like the supplicant
	who takes his petition to a government office, but leaving aside the
	real officer who has authority, presents it before one of the other
	supplicants who may be present there with his petition, and then
	starts imploring him humbly, saying Sir, you possess all the powers,
	and yours is the only authority here; so, you alone can fulfill my
	needs. &quot; Such a conduct, in the first place, is in itself
	highly foolish, but in a case like this it also amounts to high
	insolence, because the real officer who has the authority, is
	present and before his very eyes applications and petitions are
	being made before another, apart from him. Then this ignorance and
	folly reaches its height when the person before whom the petition is
	being presented makes the petitioner understand over and over again
	that he himself is a petitioner like him and possesses no power at
	all, and that the real officer who has the powers is present, and he
	should make his petition before him. But in spite of this counsel
	and warning, , the foolish person goes on saying: `Sir, you are my
	lord: you alone can fulfill my need.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Keeping
	these three things in view, one should try to understand what Allah
	has said here:`Call upon Me: I shall answer your prayers: it is for
	Me to accept them. &quot;&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote84">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote84sym" HREF="#sdfootnote84anc">84</A>Two
	things deserve special attention in this verse: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) Du'a
	(prayer) and 'ibadat (worship) have been used as synonyms here. The
	&quot;prayer&quot; of the first sentence has been called `worship&quot;
	in the second. This makes it explicit that prayer itself is worship,
	rather the essence of worship; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) the
	words they disdain My worship on account of pride&quot; have been
	used for those who do not pray to Allah. This shows that praying to
	Allah is the very requirement of one's servitude to Him, and turning
	away from Him amounts to being vain and arrogant. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to Hadrat Nu'man bin Bashir, the Holy Prophet said: The prayer is
	the very essence of worship. Then he recited this verse.&quot;
	(Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Abu Hatim, Ibn
	Jarir). According to Hadrat Anas, the Holy Prophet said. &quot;Prayer
	is the marrow of worship.&quot; (Trimidhi) Hadrat Abu Hurairah says
	that the HolyProphet said: 'Allah becomes angry with him who does
	not ask Him for anything.&quot; (Tirmidhi) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	light of the above, the enigma that often causes confusion in the
	minds is also resolved. In connection with prayer, people say that
	when the evil or the good destiny is in the control of Allah, and
	whatever He has already decreed in accordance with His dominant
	wisdom and expedience has to take place inevitably. what is then the
	use of the prayer? This is a serious misunderstanding which destroys
	the importance of prayer from the heart of man, and with this false
	notion even if man prays, his prayer would be soulless. The above
	verse of the Qur'an removes this misunderstanding in two ways: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	first place, Allah says in clear words: &brvbar;Call upon Me: I will
	answer your prayers.&quot; This proves that fate or destiny is not
	something which. God forbid, might have tied the hands of Allah
	Himself also, and the powers to answer the prayer might have been
	withdrawn froth Him. The creatures have no doubt no bower to avert
	or change the decrees of Allah: but Allah Himself certainly has the
	power to change His decrees and decisions on hearing a servant's
	prayer and petition. The other thing that has been stated in this
	verse is that whether a prayer is accepted or not, it is never
	without an advantage. The servant by presenting his petition before
	his Lord and by praying to Him acknowledges His Lordship and
	Supremacy and admits his own servitude and helplessness before Him.
	This expression of servitude is in itself &quot;worship&quot;,
	rather the essence of worship of whose reward the servant will in no
	cast be deprived, irrespective of whether he is grained the
	particular thing for which he had prayed or not. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">We get a
	full explanation of these two themes in the Sayings of the Holy
	Prophet. The following Traditions throw light on the first theme:
	Hadrat Salman Farsi (relates that the Holy Prophet said: 'Nothing
	can avert destiny but the prayer.&quot; (Tirmidhi) that is, no one
	has the power to change the decisions of Allah but Allah Himself can
	change His decisions, and this happens when the servant prays to
	Him. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Jabir bin 'Abdullah says that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Whenever
	man prays to Allah, Allah either gives him the same which he prayed
	for, or prevents a calamity of the same degree from befalling him
	provided that he does not pray for a sin or for severing relations
	with the kindred.&quot; (Tirmidhi) Another Hadith on the same
	subject has been reported by Hadrat Abu Said Khudri in which the
	Holy Prophet said: &quot;Whenever a Muslim prays, unless it be a
	prayer far .r sin or for severing relations with a kindred, Allah
	grants it in one of the three ways: Either his prayer is granted in
	this very world, or it is preserved for rewarding him in the
	Hereafter, or a disaster of the same degree is prevented from
	befalling him.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Abu Hurairah says that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;When-ever one of
	you prays,, he should not say: O God, forgive me if You so please,
	show me mercy if You so please, grant me provisions if You so
	please, but he should say definitely: O God, fulfill my such and
	such need.&quot; (Bukhari). According to another Tradition from Abu
	Hurairah, the Holy Prophet said: `Pray to Allah with the certainty
	that He will answer it.&quot; (Tirmidhi). In still another Tradition
	Hadrat Abu Hurairah has reported that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;The
	servant's prayer is granted provided that he does not pray for a sin
	or for severing connections with the kindred, and is not hasty. It
	was asked: What is being hasty, 0 Messenger of Allah? He replied:
	Being hasty is that man should say: I have prayed much, too much,
	but I see that my prayer is nor being answered. Then he should be
	tired of it and give up praying.&quot; (Muslim). The other theme is
	explained by the following Traditions: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Abu Hurairah relates that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Nothing is as
	praiseworthy in the sight of Allah as the prayer.&quot; (Tirmidhi,
	Ibn Majah). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Ibn Mas'ud says that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Ask of Allah His
	bounty, because Allah likes that He should be asked.&quot;
	(Tirmidhi) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Ibn 'Umar and Hadrat Mu'adh bin Jabal state that the Holy Prophet
	said: &quot;The prayer is in any case beneficial, both with respect
	to those calamities which have descended and with respect to those
	which have not yet descended. So, O servants of Allah, you must
	always pray.&quot; (Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Anas says that the Holy Prophet said: `Each one of you should ask
	his every need of Allah; so much so that even if his shoe-lace
	breaks, he should pray for it to Allah.&quot; (Tirmidhi). That is,
	even in matters which man feels are in his own power, he should
	invoke Allah's help for it before planning his own devices for it,
	for in no matter can man succeed only on the basis of his own
	devices without the help and succor of Allah, and praying before
	devising plans means that the servant is at all times acknowledging
	the supremacy of Allah and admitting his own helplessness.&nbsp;

	living. The creation of a wonderful thing like life from the
	lifeless substances of the earth, then the coming into being of a
