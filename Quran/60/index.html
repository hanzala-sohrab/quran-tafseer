<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Surah deals with two incidents, the time of the occurrence of which
is well known historically. The first relates to Hadrat Hatib bin Abz
Balta'a, who, a little before the conquest of Makkah, had sent a
secret letter to the Quraish chiefs informing them of the Holy
Prophet's intention to attack them. The second relates to the Muslim
women, who had started emigrating from Makkah to Madinah, after the
conclusion of the Truce of Hudaibiyah, and the problem arose whether
they also were to be returned to the disbelievers, like the Muslim
men, according to the conditions of the Truce. The mention of these
two things absolutely determines that this Surah came down during the
interval between the Truce of Hudaibiyah and the Conquest of Makkah.
Besides, there is a third thing also that has been mentioned at the
end of the Surah to the effect; What should the Holy Prophet (upon
whom be Allah's peace) make the women to pledge when they come to
take the oath of allegiance before him as believers?About this part
also the guess is that this too was sent down some time before the
conquest of Makkah, for after this conquest a large number of the
Quraish women, like their men, were going to enter Islam
simultaneously and had to be administered the oath of allegiance
collectively. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
Surah has three parts; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
first part consists of vv. 1-9, and the concluding verse 13 also
relates to it. In this strong exception has been taken to the act of
Hadrat Hatib bin Abi Balta'a in that he had tried to inform the enemy
of a very important war secret of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
Allah's peace) only for the sake of safe guarding his family. This
would have caused great bloodshed at the conquest of Makkah had it
not been made ineffective in time. It would have cost the Muslims
many precious lives; many of the Quraish would have been killed, who
were to render great services to Islam afterward; the gains which
were to accrue from conquering Makkah peacefully would have been
lost, and all these serious losses would have resulted only because
one of the Muslims had wanted to safeguard his family from the
dangers of war. Administering a severe warning at this blunder Allah
has taught the believers the lesson that no believer should, under
any circumstances and for any motive, have relations of love and
friendship with the disbelievers, who are actively hostile to Islam,
and a believer should refrain from everything which might be helpful
to them in the conflict between Islam and disbelief. However, there
is no harm in dealing kindly and justly with those disbelievers, who
may not be practically engaged in hostile activities against Islam
and persecution of the Muslims. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
second part consists of vv. 10-11. In this a social problem has been
settled, which was agitating the minds at that time. There were many
Muslim women in Makkah, whose husbands were pagans, but they were
emigrating and reaching Madinah somehow. Likewise, there were many
Muslim men in Madinah, whose wives were pagans and had been left
behind in Makkah. The question arose whether the marriage bond
between them continued to be valid or not. Allah settled this problem
for ever, saying that the pagan husband is not lawful for the Muslim
women, nor the pagan wife lawful for the Muslim husband. This
decision leads to very important legal consequences, which we shall
explain in our notes below. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
third section consists of verse 12, in which the Holy Prophet (upon
whom be Allah's peace) has been instructed to ask the women who
accept Islam to pledge that they would refrain from the major evils
that were prevalent among the womenfolk of the pre-Islamic Arab
society, and to promise that they would henceforth follow the ways of
goodness which the Messenger of Allah may enjoin. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

O you who have believed, when the believing women come to you as

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>It
	would be appropriate to give at the outset the details of the
	incident concerning which these verses were sent down so that the
	subject that follows is understood easily. The commentators are
	agreed, and Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, Qatadah, 'Urwah bin Zubair and
	others also have unanimously reported, that these verses were
	revealed at the time when a letter of Hadrat Hatib bin Abi Balta'a
	to the pagans of Makkah was intercepted. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It so
	happened that, when the Quraish broke the Treaty of Hudaibiyah, the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) started making
	preparations for an invasion of Makkah, but he did not tell anyone,
	except a few close Companions, what was the goal of the expedition.
	By chance at about the same time a woman arrived from Makkah, who
	had been a slave-girl of the Bani 'Abdul Muttalib, and then after
	her freedom had adopted singing as her profession. She complained of
	poverty to the Holy Prophet and requested for financial help. The
	Holy Prophet appealed to the Bani 'Abdul Muttalib and the Bani
	al-Muttalib and satisfied her need. When she was about to leave for
	Makkah, Hadrat Hatib bin Abi Balta'a met her and quietly gave her a
	letter addressed to some of the Makkah chiefs and paid her ten
	dinars so that she kept the secret and carried the letter to the
	addressees secretly. When she had just left Madinah, Allah informed
	the Holy Prophet (Upon whom be Allah's peace) of it. So the Holy
	Prophet immediately sent Hadrat 'AIi, Hadrat Zubair and Hadrat
	Miqdad bin Aswad after her with the instruction: &quot;Make haste:
	At Raudah khaki (12 miles from Madinah on the road to Makkah) you
	will meet a woman, who carries a letter from Hatib to the pagans of
	Makkah Seize that letter by any means you like. If she delivers the
	letter willingly, let her go; if she refuses to deliver it, kill
	her.&quot; When these Companions reached the place, they found the
	woman there They demanded the letter from her. She replied that she
	had a letter. They searched her but could find no letter. At last,
	they told her to deliver the letter, otherwise they would strip her
	and search her. When she saw that there was no way of escape, she
	took out the letter from her hair-plait and delivered it to them,
	and they brought it to the Holy Prophet. When the letter was opened
	and read it was found to contain information to the Quraish that the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) was making preparations to
	attack them. (In different traditions different wordings of the
	letter have been reported but the purport of all is one and the
	same). The Holy Prophet asked Hadrat Hatib what induced him to act
	thus. He replied: &quot;Sir, do not make haste in this matter of
	mine. I have not done this because I have become a disbeliever or an
	apostate, and have started preferring disbelief to Islam. But the
	truth is that my near and dear ones are still in Makkah. I do not
	belong to the tribe of the Quraish, but had settled there under the
	guardianship of some of them. The families of the Emigrants, which
	are still in Makkah, will be defended and protected by their tribes
	and clans, but 1 have no tribe, which could give protection to my
	family. Therefore, I sent this letter in order to keep the Quraish
	under obligation so that they did not harm my children. &quot;
	(According to Hadrat Hatib's .son `Abdur Rahman, Hadrat Habit had
	his children and brother still in Makkah at that time, and according
	to Hadrat Hatib's own report his mother also was there). Hearing
	what Hatib had to say, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)
	said to the people: &quot;Hatib has told you the truth. &quot; That
	is, the real motive of his action was this and not any treachery
	against Islam or any intention to support disbelief. Hadrat `Umar
	rose and said: &quot;Permit me, O Messenger of Allah, that I should
	cut off this hypocrite's head: he has been treacherous to Allah and
	His Messenger and the Muslims.&quot; The Holy Prophet said: &quot;This
	man has participated in the Battle of Badr: You may not know, O
	`Umar, Allah may have looked favorably at the people of Badr and
	said: &quot;Do as you please, I have forgiven you. &quot; (The words
	in the last sentence are different in different traditions. In some
	these are to the effect: &quot;I have granted you forgiveness&quot;;
	in some other: I am your Forgiver&quot;; and in still an other: &quot;I
	will forgive you.&quot;) Hearing this Hadrat 'Umar wept and said:
	&quot;Allah and His Messenger have the best knowledge. &quot; This
	is a resume of those many traditions which Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad,
	Abu Da'ud, Timidhi Nasa'i, Ibn Jarir Tabari, Ibn Hisham, Ibn Hibban
	and Ibn Abi Hatim have related on the authority of several reliable
	transmitters. The most authentic of these is the tradition which
	Hadrat `Ali's secretary, 'Ubaidullah bin Abu Rafi', heard from
	Hadrat `Ali himself, and from him Hadrat 'Ali's grandson, Hasan bin
	Muhammad bin Hanafiyah, heard and conveyed to the later reporters.
	In none of these there is .any mention that Hadrat Hatib was
	pardoned when he presented this excuse. But there is no hint either
	to show that he was awarded some punishment. That is why the Muslim
	scholars have concluded that Hadrat Hatib's excuse was accepted and
	he was pardoned.&nbsp;

	following conclusions arc deduced from the details of the cast of
	Hadrat Hatib, as mentioned above, and the verses which were sent
	down in this connection: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Whatever the motive of the person, it was in itself an act of
	espionage, and a very dangerous kind of espionage on a critical
	occasion. The enemy, who was absolutely unaware, had been informed
	of the immanent attack from Madinah. Then it was not a case based on
	suspicion but a letter written by the concerned person himself had
	been intercepted, after which no other proof of the guilt was
	required. These were not peace but war time conditions; yet the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) did not place Hadrat Hatib in
	confinement without giving-him a chance of self-defense: This chance
	also was not given him in private but publicly before the people.
	This makes it manifest that there is no room in Islam for such, laws
	and regulations under which the ruler may have the right in any case
	to imprison a person only on the basis of his own knowledge or
	suspicion. Islam also does not recognize the method of trying a
	person secretly in secret. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Hadrat Hatib was not only one of the Emigrants but also a
	participant in the Battle of Badr, and enjoyed a distinguished place
	among the Companions. But despite this a serious crime happened to
	be committed by him and Allah took him to task for this in the
	Qur'an as is evident from the above verses. In the Hadith too, his
	case has been narrated in detail and among the commentators also
	there may be none who has not made a reference to it. These arc some
	of the evidences which prove that the Companions were not innocent.
	They also could commit errors because of human weaknesses, and
	errors happened to be committed by them practically. The teaching of
	regarding them with respect and reverence that Allah and His
	Messenger have given, does not at all require that if one of them
	happened to commit an error, it should not be mentioned, for
	evidently, if this were their demand, neither would Allah have
	mentioned them in His Book, nor the Companions and their successors
	and the traditionists and the commentators would have related their
	details in their traditions and books. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	view that Hadrat `Umar expressed in the case of Hadrat Hatib
	concerned the apparent aspect of the act. His reasoning was that the
	act was clearly in the nature of treachery to Allah and His
	Messenger and the Muslims; therefore, Hatib was a hypocrite and
	deserved to be put to death. But the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) rejected his viewpoint and explained the viewpoint of
	the Islamic Shari'ah, saying: &quot;Decision should not be given
	only on the outward form of the act but it should also be seen what
	evidence is given by the past lift and general character of the
	person, who happens to commit the act and the circumstances under
	which he commits it. The act, no doubt, smacked of espionage, but
	did the attitude of the person concerned towards Islam and the
	followers of Islam until then indicate that he could do such a thing
	with the intention of treachery to Allah and His Messenger and the
	Muslims? He was one of those who had emigrated for the sake of the
	Faith. Could he have made such a sacrifice without sincerity? He
	fought in a critical battle like Badr for the sake of his Faith when
	the Muslims were facing an enemy much better equipped and three
	times their number, Could the sincerity of such a person be doubted?
	Or, could it be believed that he had the slightest inclination
	towards the Quraish? He was telling the plain truth that his family
	at Makkah did not enjoy the protection of any tribe or clan, which
	the families of the other Emigrants enjoyed; therefore, he acted
	thus during war time only in order to safeguard his children from
	the persecution of the disbelievers. The facts confirmed that he did
	not really belong to any tribe at Makkah and this too was known that
	his family members were still back at Makkah. Therefore, there was
	no reason why his statement should be taken as false and the opinion
	formed that his actual motive was not this but the intention of
	treachery. No doubt, for a sincere Muslim even with a good intention
	it was not lawful that he should inform the enemy of the military
	plans of the Muslims only for the sake of his personal interests,
	yet there is a great difference between the error of a sincere
	Muslim and the treachery of a hypocrite. Both cannot be awarded the
	same punishment only on the basis of the similarity between their
	acts. This was the Holy Prophet's decision in this case, and Allah
	confirmed it in the verses of Surah Al Mumtahinah. A careful study
	of the above three verses will show that in these Allah has
	certainly reprimanded Hatib, but it is a kind of a reprimand
	administered to a believer and not the one administered to a
	hypocrite. Moreover, no penalty, or physical punishment was awarded
	to him, but he was administered a severe rebuke publicly and lot
	off, which meant that in a Muslim society even a blot on the honor
	of a guilty believer and his falling into disrepute also was a very
	severe punishment. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) About
	the great merit of tile Companions who fought at Badr, the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) said: You may not know Allah
	might have looked favorably at tilt people of Badr and said: 'Do as
	you please, I have forgiven you'.&quot; This does not moan that the
	Companions of Badr were forgiven each and . every sin and they were
	at liberty to commit whatever sin and crime they pleased, for
	forgiveness had already been guaranteed to them This was neither
	meant by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) nor the
	Companions ever understood it in this meaning, nor any Canpartion of
	Badr after hearing this good news ever thought that he was free to
	commit any sin, nor ever any rule was made on the basis of this in
	the Islamic Shari'ah that if a Companion of Badr happened to commit
	a sin, he should not be given ally punishment for it. As a matter of
	fact, if one considers the circumstances under which this was said
	and the words that the Holy Prophet used on this occasion carefully,
	one can clearly understand the meaning to be this: &quot;It would
	not be anything impossible if in view of the great and meritorious
	services that the Companions rendered at Badr out of sincerity and
	devotion and at the very risk of their lives for the sake of Allah
	and His Religion, Allah might have forgiven all their former and
	latter sins mercifully. Therefore, you should not suspect such a
	Companion of treachery and hypocrisy, and should accept the excuse
	that he himself is presenting for his crime.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) From
	the Qur'an and the Holy Prophet's sayings it also becomes evident
	that a Muslim's being involved in espionage for the disbelievers by
	itself is not a sufficient basis for the conclusion that he has
	become an apostate, or is devoid of the Faith, or is a hypocrite.
	For reaching such a conclusion if there arc some other circumstances
	and evidences, it would be a different thing; otherwise by itself
	this act is only a crime, not a sign of disbelief. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) From
	these verses of the Qur'an it also becomes evident that for a Muslim
	it is in no case permissible that he should spy for the
	disbelievers, no matter how gravely his own life and property, or
	that of his near and dear ones, might be endangered. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) When
	Hadrat `Umar asked for the Holy Prophet's permission to put Hadrat
	Hatib to death for the crime of espionage, the Holy Prophet did not
	say that the crime was not punishable with -death, but declined
	permission on the ground that Hatib's being a Companion of Badr was
	an express proof of his being sincere, and the statement given by
	him was correct that be had acted thus not out of any good wishes
	for the enemies but for the sake of safeguarding his family from any
	possible persecution to death. From this one section of the jurists
	has argued that the general law in respect of a Muslim spy is that
	he should be put to death, unless there are very weighty-reasons for
	awarding him a lesser punishment or a mere reprimand. But the
	jurists have disputed this question. Imam Shafe'i and some other
	jurists hold the view that the Muslim spy is punishable, but not
	with death. Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Auza'i maintain that he will
	be subjected to corporal punishment and long imprisonment. Imam
	Malik says that he will be put to death, but the Malik; jurists hold
	different views on this question. Ash'hab says that the Muslim ruler
	has vast powers in this matter. He can exercise his judgment keeping
	in view the circumstances of the crime and the culprit and award him
	any punishment. A saying of Imam Malik and Ibn al-Qasim also is to
	the same effect. Ibn al Majishun and `Abdul Malik bin Habib say that
	if the culprit is a habitual spy, he should be put to death. Ibn
	Wahb says that the punishment of the spy is death, but if he repents
	of spying, he may be pardoned. Sahnun says that one cannot know
	whether his repentance is genuine or deceptive; therefore, he should
	be put to death. There is a saying of Ibn al-Qasim also in support
	of this. And Asbagh says that the belligerent spy is punishable with
	death, but the Muslim or dhimmi spy should be given corporal
	punishment instead of the death sentence, unless he be helping the
	enemies openly as against the Muslims. (Ibn al-`Arabi, Ahkam
	al-Qur'an; 'Umdat al-Qari; Fath al-Bari.) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(8) The
	Hadith that has been cited above also permits that for the
	investigation of the crime not only the male but the female accused
	also can be stripped if so required. Although Hadrat `Ali, Hadrat
	Zubair and Hadrat Miqdad had not stripped the woman, yet they had
	threatened her that if she did not produce the letter, they would
	strip and search her.. Obviously, if it were not lawful, the three
	illustrious Companions could not have threatened her thus. And one
	can understand that they must have reported the story of their
	expedition on their return to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah s
	peace). Had he expressed his displeasure, it must have been
	reported. That is why the jurists have held it as permissible.

	other words, it means: &quot;Though there is an excellent example
	for you in Abraham's conduct in that he expressed disapproval of his
	pagan people and broke off all connections with them, yet his
	promise to pray for the forgiveness of his pagan father and then
	carrying it out practically is not worth following, for the
	believers should not have even this much relationship of love and
	sympathy with the disbelievers. In At-Taubah: 113, Allah has clearly
	warned: &quot;It does not behoove the Prophet and those who have
	believed that they should pray for the forgiveness of the
	polytheists even though they be near kinsmen. &quot; Thus, no Muslim
	is allowed to pray for the forgiveness of his unbelieving kinsmen on
	the basis of the argument that the Prophet Abraham had done so. As
	for the question, why did the Prophet Abraham pray thus, and did he
	carry out his promise practically? the answer has been provided by
	the Qur'an in full detail. When his father expelled him from the
	house, he had said on his departure: &quot;I bid you farewell: I
	will pray to my Lord for your forgiveness.&quot; (maryam: 47). On
	the basis of this very promise he prayed for him twice. One prayer
	is contained in Surah Ibrahim: 41: &quot;Lord, forgive me and my
	parents and the believers on the Day when reckoning will be hold. &quot;
	And the second prayer is in Surah Ash Shua'ra 86: &quot;Forgive my
	father, for indeed he is from among those who have strayed and do
	not disgrace the an the Day when the people will be raised back to
	life.&quot; But afterwards when he realized that the father for
	whose forgiveness he was praying, wan an enemy of Allah, he excused
	himself from it and broke off even this relationship of love and
	sympathy with him: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;As
	regards the prayer of Abraham for his father, it was only to fulfill
	a promise he bad made to him, but when he realized that he was an
	enemy of Allah, he disowned him. The fact is that Abraham was a
	tender-hearted, God fearing and forbearing man (At-Taubah: 114). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A study
	of these verses make: the principle manifest that only that act of
	the prophets worthy of following, which they persistently practiced
	till the end. As regards those acts which they themselves gave up,
	or which Allah restrained them from practicing or which were
	forbidden in the Divine Shari ah, they are not worth following, and
	no one showed follow such acts of theirs on the basis of the
	argument that that was such and such a prophet's practice. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here,
	another question also arises, which may create confusion in some
	minds. In the verse under discussion, the saying of the Prophet
	Abraham which Allah has declared as not worth following, has two
	parts. The first part is that he said to his father: &quot;I will
	pray for your forgiveness,&quot; and the second: `I have no power to
	get anything for you from Allah. &quot; Of these the first thing's
	not being a worthy examples to be. followed is understandable, but,
	what is wrong with the second thing that that too has been made an
	exception from being an example worthily of imitation, whereas it by
	itself is a truth? The answer is that the saying of the Prophet
	Abraham has been included in the exception for the reason that when
	a person after making a promise with another to do something, says
	that it is riot in his power to do anything beyond that for him, it
	automatically gives the meaning that if it were in his power to do
	anything further for him, he would have done that too for his sake.
	This makes his relationship of sympathy with the other person even
	more manifest. On that very basis this second part of the saying of
	the Prophet Abraham also deserved to be included in the exception,
	although its subject was true in so far as it does not lit even in
	the power of a Prophet to have a person forgiven by Allah. 'Allama
	Alusi also in his Ruh al-Ma ani has given this same answer to this
	question.</P>

	justice, in fact, has been used in a special sense. It means:
	&quot;Justice demands that you should not be hostile to those who
	are not hostile to you, for it is not justice to treat the enemy and
	the non-enemy alike. You have every right to adopt a stem attitude
	towards those who persecuted you for embracing Islam and compelled
	you to leave yew homes and pursued you even after your expulsion.
	But as for those who were not partners in persecuting you, you
	should treat them well and should fulfill the right they have on you
	because of blood and other relationships. &quot;&nbsp;

	instructions to sever relations with the disbelievers given in the
	preceding verses, could cause the people the misunderstanding that
	this was because of their being the disbelievers. Therefore, in
	these verses it has been made clear that its actual cause is not
	their disbelief but their hostility to Islam and their tyrannical
	treatment of the followers of Islam. The Muslims, therefore, should
	distinguish between the hostile disbeliever and the non-hostile
	disbeliever, and should treat those disbelievers well who have never
	treated them evilly. Its best explanation is the incident that took
	place between Hadrat Asma', daughter of Abu Bakr, and her
	disbelieving mother. A wife of Hadrat Abu Bakr's was Qutaylah bint
	'Abdul `Uzza, who wax a disbeliever and had remained behind in
	Makkah after the migration. Hadrat Asma' had been born of her. After
	the peace treaty of Hudaibiyah when the traffic opened between
	Makkah and Madinah, she came to Madinah to see her daughter and also
	brought sane gifts. Hadrat Asma' herself has related that she went
	to the Holy Prophet and asked: &quot;Should I see my mother? And can
	I treat her as a daughter should treat her mother?&quot; The Holy
	Prophet replied: &quot;Yes, treat her as your mother. &quot; (Musnad
	Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim). Hadrat Asma's son, 'Abdullah bin Zubair,
	has given further details of this incident. He says that Hadrat
	Asma' in the beginning had refused to see her mother. Then, when she
	received Allah and His Messenger's permission she met her. (Musnad
	Ahmad, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim). This by itself leads to the
	conclusion that a Muslim's serving his unbelieving parents and his
	helping his unbelieving brothers and sisters and relatives is
	permissible when they are not hostile to Islam; Likewise one can
	spend one s charities also on the indigent among the dhimmis

<DIV ID="sdfootnote14">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote14sym" HREF="#sdfootnote14anc">14</A>The
	background of this injunction is that after the peace treaty of
	Hudaibiyah, in the beginning, the Muslim men started fleeing Makkah
	and arriving at Madinah and they were sent back according to the
	terms of the treaty. Then the Muslim women started arriving and,
	first of all, Umm Kulthum Uqbah bin Abi Mu'ait emigrated to Madinah,
	The disbelievers invoked the treaty and demanded return, ands two
	brothers of Umm Kulthum, Walid bin `Uqbah and 'Amarah bin `Uqbah,
	came to Madinah to take her back. At this the question arose whether
	the treaty of Hudaibiyah applied to the women as well. Allah has
	answered this very question here, saying: &quot;If they are Muslims,
	and it is ascertained that they have emigrated only for the sake of
	the Faith and for no other motive, they are not to be returned &quot;
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, a
	complication has arisen on account of the narration of the Hadith
	from the viewpoint of the meaning and content, and it must be
	resolved. The traditions that are found in the Ahadith about the
	conditions of the treaty of Hudaibiyah are mostly traditions
	narrated from the viewpoint of the meaning and purport, About the
	condition under discussion the words in the different traditions are
	different. In same the words are to the effect: &quot;Whoever
	reaches us from you, we will not return hira, but whoever reaches
	you from us, you shall return. &quot; In some others the words arc
	to the effect: &quot;Whoever of his Companions comes to the
	Messenger of Allah without the permission of his guardian, he will
	send him back.&quot; And in still another the words are:
	&quot;Whoever,from the Quraish goes to Muhammad without the
	permission of his guardian, he will return him to Quraish. &quot;
	The style of these traditions by itself shows that this condition of
	the treaty has not been reported in the actual words of the treaty,
	but the reporters have reported its purport in their own words. But
	since most of the traditions arc of the same nature, the
	commentators and traditionists generally have understood that the
	treaty was general, which applied to both men and women, and the
	women too were to be returned according to it. Later, when this
	injunction of the Qur'an that the believing women were not to be
	returned, came to their knowledge, they interpreted it to mean that
	Allah in this verse had decided to break the treaty in so far as it
	related to the believing women But this was not an ordinary thing
	which should be accepted so easily. If the treaty was general,
	without any exception in respect of men and women, it could not be
	lawful for one party to amend it unilaterally and change a part of
	it by itself. And even if such a thing happened, it is strange that
	the Quraish did not protest against it, whereas they remained on the
	lookout for an opportunity to raise objections against everything
	that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and the Muslims
	did. Had they found that the Holy Prophet had committed a breach of
	the treaty conditions, they would have raised a loud clamor. But we
	do not find any trace of it in any tradition that they took an
	exception to this ruling of the Qur'an. Had this question been
	carefully considered the problem could have been resolved by
	reference to the actual words of the treaty. But many people paid no
	attention they it; if some scholars (e.g Qadi Abu Bakr Ibn
	al-'Arabi) did pay any attention, they did not hesitate to say that
	the reason why the Quraish did not raise any objection was that
	Allah had miraculously scaled their mouths in this matter. It is
	strange how these scholars felt satisfied at this explanation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The fact
	of the matter is that this condition of the peace treaty had been
	proposed by the disbelieving Quraish, and not by the Muslims, and
	the words that Suhail bin 'Amr, their representative, had-got
	included in the treaty were: &quot;And that whichever man (rajul)
	cornea to you from us, even if he be on your religion, you will
	return him to us.&quot; These words of the treaty have been
	reproduced in Bukhari (Kitab ash-Shurut: Bab ash-Shurut fil-Jihad
	wal-Masalahah) through authentic channels. It may be that Suhail
	used the word rajul in the meaning of a person, but this might be
	the meaning he had in his mind. The word written in the treaty was
	rajul, which is used for a full-grown man in Arabic. That is why
	when the brothers of Umm Kulthum bint 'Uqbah came to the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and demanded her return,
	(according to Imam Zuhri's tradition) the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) refused return her, saying: &quot;The condition was
	about the men, not the women. &quot; (Ibn al- Arabi, Ahkam al-Qur
	an; Loam Razi, Tafsir Kabir) Until then the people of Quraish
	themselves were under the delusion that the treaty applied to all
	kinds of emigrants, men or women; But when the Holy Prophet drew
	their attention to these words of the treaty, they were struck dumb
	and had to accept this decision. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to this condition of the treaty the Muslims had the right to decline
	return of any woman who emigrated from Makkah to Madinah, for any
	reason whatever. But Islam was interested only in safeguarding the
	believing omen and not to make the holy city of Madinah a place of
	refuge for every kind of female fugitive. Therefore, Allah enjoined:
	&quot;Ascertain by examination the faith of the women who emigrated
	to you and profess to have believed; and when it is fully
	ascertained that they have emigrated with genuine faith, and no
	other motive, do not return them.&quot; Thus, the procedure adopted
	for carrying out this Command was was that the women who emigrated
	were questioned whether they believed in the oneness of Allah and
	the Prophethood of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) and had
	emigrated only for the sake of Allah and His Messenger, and not out
	of any worldly consideration, e.g. hatred of the husband, or love of
	somebody in Madinah, or some other worldly motive. Only those women
	who gave satisfactory answers to these questions were detained,
	others were sent back. (Ibn Jarir on the authority of Iba `Abbas,
	Qatadah, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Ibn Zaid). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	verse a basic principle of the Law of Evidence also bas been stated
	and its further clarification has been made by the procedure that
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) had prescribed for
	implementing it, The verse enjoins three things: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Examine the faith of the emigrating women who present themselves as
	believers; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) Allah
	alone knows the truth about their faith; the Muslims have no means
	to find out whether they have really believed or not; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) when
	it has been ascertained that they are believers, they are not to be
	returned. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then, in
	accordance with this injunction, the method that the Holy Prophet
	prescribed for examining and ascertaining the faith of the women was
	that the statement given by them on oath should be relied on and it
	should be made sure after necessary examination that they had no
	other motive of emigration than the Faith. First, it gives the
	principle that for taking decision on different matters it is not
	necessary for the court to have direct knowledge of the truth; for
	the court only that knowledge is sufficient which is obtained
	through evidence. Second, the statement given by a person on oath
	will be regarded as reliable until it is proved to be false by a
	clear evidence. Third, whatever declaration a person himself may
	make about his creed and faith, will be accepted and no search will
	be made into finding out,whether what he states actually constitutes
	his faith or not, unless there is a clear indication to the
	contrary. And fourth, in the personal affairs of a person, which no
	one else can know, his own statement will be trusted. e.g. in the
	matters of divorce and the waiting period (iddat) the woman's own
	statement about her menstrual course and state of purity will be
	regarded as reliable, whether it is true or false. According to
	these very rules, in the science of the Hadith also, those
	traditions will be accepted, the apparent state of whose reporters
	testifies to their being righteous, unless, of course, there are
	other circumstances which forbid the acceptance of a particular
	tradition.&nbsp;

	should be returned by the Muslims, and the dowers of the unbelieving
	married women of the Muslims. who are left behind is the abode of
	disbelief, should be got back from the disbelievers. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	historical background of these injunctions is as follows: In the
	beginning of Islam, there were many such men, who accepted Islam but
	their wives did not become Muslim, and there were many such women
	who became Muslim but their husbands did not accept Islam. Abul-'As,
	the husband of Zainab, a daughter of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace), was a non-Muslim and he remained non-Muslim for
	several years. In the early period no command had been given to the
	effect that the pagan husband was unlawful for the Muslim wife and
	the pagan wife was unlawful for the Muslim husband. Therefore, the
	marital relations continued to exist between them, Even after the
	migration for several years, it so happened that many women became
	Muslim and emigrated Madinah while their pagan husbands remained in
	the abode of disbelief. Likewise, many Muslim men emigrated and
	their pagan wives were left in the abode of disbelief. But in spite
	of this their marriage continued. This was creating complications
	for the women in particular, for the men could marry other women,
	but this was not possible for the women. Until their marriage with
	their previous husbands was dissolved, they could not remarry. After
	the peace treaty of Hudaibiyah when these verses came down, they
	annulled the previous marriage between the Muslims and the pagans,
	and laid down an absolute and clear law for guidance in future. The
	jurists of Islam have codified this law under four major heads: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	the case when both the man and the wife are in the abode of Islam
	and one of them becomes a Muslim and the of her remains an infidel. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second,
	the case when both the man and the wife are in the abode of
	disbelief, and one of them becomes a Muslim and the other remains an
	infidel. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Third,
	the cast when one of the spouses becomes a Muslim and emigrates to
	the abode of Islam and the other remains an infidel in the abode of
	disbelief. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Fourth,
	the case when either of the Muslim spouses becomes an apostate. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Below we
	give the viewpoints of the jurists with regard to a 11 the four
	cases separately: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) In
	the first case, if the husband has accepted Islam and' his wife is a
	Christian or a Jewess, and she remains faithful to her religion,
	their marriage will endure, for it is permissible for a Muslim to
	have a wife who is a follower of the earlier scriptures. This is
	agreed upon by all jurists. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And if
	the wife of the man who has accepted Islam, is not a follower of the
	'earlier Books, and she adheres to her Faith, the Hanafis say that
	Islam will be presented before her; if she accepts it, the marriage
	will endure; if she refuses to accept it, separation will be
	effected between them. In this case, if consummation between them
	had taken place, the woman will be entitled to the dower; if there
	was no consummation, she will not be entitled to any dower, for
	separation has been caused because of her refusal. (AI-Mabsut;
	Hedayah; Fath al-Qadir). Imam Shafe'i and Imam Ahmad say that if the
	spouses did not have had consummation, the woman would be outside
	wedlock as soon as the man accepted Islam, and if consummation had
	taken place; the woman will remain in wedlock till three
	menstruations. During this period if she accepts Islam of her own
	tree wills the marriage will continue, otherwise it will become void
	automatically as soon as she is free from her third menstrual
	course. Imam Shafei also adds that it is not right to present Islam
	before the woman an the basis of the pledge of non-interference in
	religion that the dhimmis have been given by the Muslims. But this,
	in fact, is a weak argument for interference in the dhimmi woman's
	rcligion would be if she was compelled to accept Islam. It is no
	interference to tell her that if she accepted Islam, she would
	continue to be her husband's wife, otherwise she would be separated
	from him. In Hadrat Ali's time there has been a precedent of this
	nature An Iraqi landowner who was a Majusi by religion accepted
	Islam and his wife remained an unbeliever, Hadrat 'AIi presented
	Islam before her, and when she refused to accept it, he effected
	separation between them. (Al-Mabsut). Imam Malik says that if
	consummation has not taken place, the unbelieving wife would
	forthwith cease to be the wife as soon as the man embraced Islam,
	and if consummation has taken place, Islam would be presented before
	the woman, and in case she refuses to accept it. separation will
	result. (Ibn Qudamah, Al-Mughni ). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And if
	Islam has been accepted by the woman and the man remains an infidel.
	whether he is a follower of an earlier scripture or a non-follower,
	the Hanafis say that Islam will be presented before the husband
	whether consummation between them has taken place or not. If he
	accepts it, the woman will continue to be his wife; if he rejects it
	the qadi will effect separation between them. So long as the man
	does not refuse to accept Islam, the woman will remain his wife, but
	he will not have the right to have sexual relations with her. In
	case the husband refuses, separation will become effective just like
	an irrevocable divorce. If consummation has not taken place before
	this, the woman will be entitled to half the dower, and if it has
	taken place, the woman will be entitled to full dower as well as
	maintenance during the waiting period ( iddat). (AI-Mabsut; Hedayah;
	Fath at-Qadir). According to Imam Shafe`i, marriage will dissolve as
	soon as the woman accepted Islam in case consummation has not taken
	place, and in case it has taken place, the woman will continue to be
	the man's wife till the end of the waiting period. If in the
	mean-time he accepts Islam, marriage will remain valid, otherwise
	separation will take place as soon as the waiting period comes to an
	end. But in the case of the man also Imam Shafe'i has expressed the
	same opinion as he has expressed about the woman as cited above.
	That is, it is not right to present Islam before him. But this is a
	weak opinion. In the time of Hadrat 'Umar, on several occasions, the
	woman accepted Islam and the man was invited to Islam; when he
	refused to accept it, separation was effected between the spouses
	There is, for examples the case of the wife of a Christian of the
	Bani Taghlib, which was brought before him. Hadrat `Umar said to the
	man, &quot;Accept Islam, otherwise I will effect separation between
	you two.&quot; He declined, and the Caliph enforced the decree. The
	case of a newly converted lady of Bahz al-Malik was sent to him. In
	her case too he ordered that Islam be presented before her husband;
	if he accepts it well and good, otherwise separation be effected
	between them. These incidents had happened in front of the
	Companions and no dispute or difference of opinion has been
	reported. (AI-Jassas, Ahkam al-Qur an; Al Mabsut; Fath al-Qadir).
	Imam Malik's opinion in this connection is that if the woman becomes
	a Muslim before the consummation of marriage Islam should be
	presented before the husband; if he accepts it, well and 'good;
	otherwise separation should be effected forthwith. An!? if
	consummation has taken place, and the woman has accepted Islam
	afterwards, she will have to wait till the end of the waiting
	period. If the husband accepts Islam in the meantime, marriage will
	continue otherwise separation will take place as soon as the waiting
	period expires. A saying of Imam Ahmad is in support of Imam
	Shafe'i. His other saying is to the effect that the event of the
	difference of religion between the spouses will in any case lead to
	immediate separation, whether consummation between them has taken
	place or not. (AI-Mughni). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) If in
	dar al-kufr (abode of disbelief ) the woman becomes a Muslim and the
	man remains an infidel, or the man becomes a Muslim and the wife
	(who neither is Christian nor Jew but is follower of a non-revealed
	religion) remains an infidel the Hanafi viewpoint is that separation
	will not take place, whether consummation between them has taken
	place or not, until the woman completes three menstrual courses, or
	until she passes three months in case she is non-menstruating. If in
	the meantime the other spouse is also converted, marriage will
	remain valid, otherwise separation will take place on the expiry of
	the term. Imam Shafe'i, in this case also, distinguishes between the
	occurrence of consummation and its nonoccurence He maintains that if
	there was no consummation, separation would occur immediately on the
	event of the difference of religion between the spouses. And if the
	difference of religion has occurred after the consummation, marriage
	will continue valid until the end of the waiting period. If in the
	meantime the other spouse does not accept Islam, marriage will
	dissolve as soon as the waiting period comes to an end. (Al Mabsut,
	Fath al-Qadir, AI-Jassas Ahkam al-Qur an). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In case
	where along with the difference of religion between the spouses the
	separation of abode also takes place, i.e. one of them remains an
	infidel in daral-kufr(the non-Muslim state) and the other emigrates
	to dar al-lslam (the Islamic state), the Hanafi viewpoint is that
	marriage between them will automatically dissolve. If the emigrant
	is the woman, she has the right to remarry immediately; she does not
	have to observe any waiting period. However, her husband will have
	to abstain from sexual intercourse until after she has discharged
	the menses once; and if she is pregnant, even then marriage can be
	contracted, but the husband must abstain from cohabitation until
	after the delivery. Imam Muhammad and Imam Abu Yusuf have differed
	from Imam Abu Hanifah in this. They say that the woman has to
	observe the waiting period; and if she is pregnant, she cannot
	contract marriage before the delivery. (Al-Mabsut; Hedayah;
	AI-Jassas, Ahkam al-Qur'an). Imam Shafe.'i, Imam Ahmad and Imam
	Malik maintain that the separation of abode has nothing to do with
	this, for the real thing is only the deference of religion. If this
	difference takes place between the spouses, the injunctions to
	govern this are the same as those which govern it in case such a
	difference takes place between the spouses in the Islamic state
	(AI-Mughni). Imam Shafe`i along with his above-cited opinion has
	also expressed the view that if the emigrant Muslim woman has
	emigrated after a quarrel with her infide I husband, with the
	intention of dissolving his marital right, an immediate separation
	will take place not on the basis of the separation of abode
	(ikhtilaf dar) but on the basis of her this intention. (Al-Mabsut'
	Hedayah). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But a
	careful consideration of the Qur'anic verse under discussion clearly
	shows that in this matter the most sound opinion is the one that
	Imam Abu Hanifah has expressed. Allah has sent down this verse
	concerning the believing women who emigrated and about them He has
	said that they are no longer lawful for the pagan husbands whom they
	have left behind in dar al-k-kufr, and has allowed the Muslims of
	the Islamic state to marry them after they have paid them the
	dowers. On the other hand, the emigrant Muslims have been addressed
	and enjoined not to keep those of their pagan wives in wedlock, who
	are left is dar al-kufr, and to ask of the disbelievers the dowers
	that they had given to those women. Obviously, these injunctions do
	not pertain only to the difference of religion, but it is the
	difference of abode that has given these injunctions this particular
	form. If on account of migration the marriages of the Muslim women
	with. their pagan husbands had not become dissolved, how could the
	Muslims be permitted to marry them, and .that too in a way that the
	permission does not contain any reference to the observance of the
	waiting period by them? Likewise, if even after the revelation of
	the Command, &quot;and you also should not hold back unbelieving
	women in marriage the pagan wives of the Muslim emigrants had
	continued to be their wives, they also would have been commanded to
	divorce them. But there is no reference here to this either. No
	doubt, it is correct that after the revelation of this verse, Hadrat
	`Umar and Hadrat Talhah and some other Emigrants had divorced their
	wives, but this is no proof that such a thing was at all necessary,
	and their severing of the marital relationship with those wives
	depended on their pronouncing divorce on them, and if they had not
	pronounced the divorce, the wives would have continued to be their
	legal wives.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In
	response to this, three events of the Holy Prophet's time are quoted
	as precedents, which are regarded as a proof that even after the
	revelation these verses the Holy prophet (upon whom be Allah's
	peace), in spite of the separation of abode, allowed the marriage
	relationship to continue between the believing and the unbelieving
	spouses. The first event is this, a little before the conquest of
	Makkah, Abu Sufyan visited the Islamic army at Marr az-Zahran
	(present Wadi Fatimah) and accepted Islam, and his wife, Hind,
	remained a pagan in Makkah. Then Hind accepted Islam after the
	conquest of Makkah, and the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) ruled
	that their previous marriage would continue to be valid. The second
	event is that after the conquest of Makkah, `Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl
	and Hakim bin Hizam fled Makkah and in their absence the wives of
	both became Muslims Then they sought the Holy Prophet's protection
	for their husbands and went and brought them back. Both the men come
	before the Holy Prophet and accepted Islam and in their case too he
	held their previous marriages as valid. The third event relates to
	the Holy Prophet's own daughter, Hadrat Zainab, who emigrated to
	Madinah and her husband, Abul-'As, was left an infidel in Makkah.
	About him Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah contain a
	tradition on the authority of Ibn `Abbas, saying that he came to
	Madinah in A.H. 8 and became a Muslim, and the Holy Prophet allowed
	his daughter to continue in marriage with him, without renewal of
	marriage. But the first two of these events, in fact, do not come
	under the definition of the difference of abode. For the difference
	of abode does not mean a person's .temporarily leaving one place for
	another, or his fleeting to another place, but the difference takes
	place only in case a person emigrates from one place and settles
	down in another place and the difference of nationality takes place
	between him and his wife. As for the event relating to Hadrat Zainab
	(may Allah bless her), there arc two traditions, one related on the
	authority of Ibn `Abbas, as referred to above, and the other related
	by Imam Ahmad, Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah on the authority of Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin `As. In this second tradition it has been
	stated that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) allowed
	his daughter to continue as the wife of Abul-'As after renewal of
	the marriage, and with a fresh dower. Thus, in the first place, this
	precedent, due to the difference in reporting, no longer remains a
	definite argument with those who deny the legal effect of the
	separation of abode. Secondly, if they insist on the authenticity of
	Ibn `Abbas's tradition, it contradicts their own viewpoint. For,
	according to their viewpoint, the marriage of the spouses between
	whom difference of religion takes place and who have consummated
	their marriage remains valid only until three menstruations. In the
	meantime if the other party also accepts Islam the marriage
	continues to be valid, otherwise it dissolves automatically as soon
	as the third menstrual course starts. But in the case of Hadrat
	Zainab from which they take their argument, the difference of
	religion between the spouses had taken place several years earlier.
	Abul-'As had affirmed the faith six years after Hadrat Zainab's
	emigration, and at least two years before his conversion to Islam
	the injunction had been revealed' in the Qur'an, according to which
	the Muslim woman had been forbidden for the pagans.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	fourth case is of apostasy. Its one form is that both the husband
	and the wife should become apostates together, and the other that
	one of them becomes an apostate and the other remains a Muslim. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If both
	the husband and the wife become apostates together, the Shafe'is and
	the Hanbalis say that their marriage contracted in Islam will
	dissolve immediately if this happened before consummation, and after
	the lapse of the waiting period if it happened after consummation.
	On the contrary, the Hanafis hold the view that. although according
	to common sense their marriage should dissolve, yet in the time of
	Hadrat Abu Bakr, when thousands of people became apostates, and then
	again became Muslims, the Companions did not direct anyone to renew
	the marriage; therefore, we accept this unanimous decision of the
	('companions and admit, contrary to common sense, that in case both
	the husband and the wife become apostates together, their '
	marriages do not dissolve.&quot;(AIMabsut; Hedayah; Fath al-Qadir
	Al-Fiqh 'alal-Madhahib al- Arba'h). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If the
	husband becomes an apostate and the wife continues to be Muslim,
	according to the Hanafis and the Malikis, the marriage will dissolve
	immediately, whether this happens before consummation or after it.
	But the Shafe'is and the Hanbalis in this connection make a
	distinction between the two states. If it happens before
	consummation, the marriage will dissolved immediately, and if it
	happens after consummation it will endure till the end of the
	waiting period, In the meantime ii' the person returns to Islam,
	marriage will continue to hold good, otherwise, on the expiry of the
	waiting period, it will be deemed to have dissolved since he became
	an apostate. That is, the woman will not have to observe another
	waiting period afresh. All the four jurists are agreed that if this
	happened before consummation, the woman would be entitled to half
	the dower, and if after consummation to full dower. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And if
	the woman became an apostate, the old ruling of the Hanafis was that
	in this case too. marriage would dissolve immediately. But later the
	scholars of Balkh and Samarkand gave the ruling that in case the
	woman becomes an apostate, separation does not take place
	immediately; and by this their object was to discourage the women
	from adopting this course in order to get rid of their husbands. The
	Malikis' verdict is somewhat similar. They say that if circumstances
	testify that the woman adopted this course only as a pretence to win
	separation from the husband, separation will not take place. The
	Shafe'is and the Hanbalis say that in case of the woman's turning an
	apostate too, the law is the same as in case of the husband's
	turning an apostate. That is, if she became an apostate before
	consummation, marriage would dissolve immediately and if after
	consummation, Marriage will endure till the end of the waiting
	period. If conversion takes place in the meantime marriage will
	continue to hold good, otherwise it will be deemed to have dissolved
	since the time of apostasy. There is consensus with regard to the
	dower. If the woman became an apostate, before consummation she
	would not be entitled to any dower, and if she adopted apostasy
	after consummation, she would be entitled to full dower.

	this brief sentence two important points of the law have been
	stated: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that obedience even to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah s peace)
	has boon restricted to &quot;in what is good&quot;, although about
	the Holy Prophet no one could imagine that he would order somebody
	to do an evil From this it automatically follows that no one in the
	world can be obeyed outside the bounds of Divine law. For when
	obedience to Allah's Messenger-himself is conditional upon &quot;in
	what is good&quot;. who else can have a position to demand
	unconditional obedience and require the people to obey and follow
	each of his commands laws, rules or customs, which are opposed to
	the law of Allah? The Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) has
	stated this principle, thus: &quot;There is no obedience in the
	disobedience of Allah; obedience is only in what is good and right.&quot;
	(Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i). Our great doctors have derived this
	very theme from this verse, Hadrat 'Abdur Rehman bin Zaid bin Aslam
	says: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Allah
	has not said that they should not disobey you (the Holy Prophet) but
	that they should not disobey you in what is good. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then,
	when Allah Almighty has made obedience even to the Holy Prophet
	himself conditional upon this, how can another person have the right
	that he should be obeyed in anything but what is good?&quot; (Ibn
	Jarir). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Imam Abu
	Bakr al-Jassas writes: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Allah
	knew that His Prophet never enjoined anything but what was good.
	Still He restricted obedience to him only in what is good, so that
	no one ever may find a provision to obey the kings when they
	enjoined something outside the obedience of Allah. The Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be Allah's peace) has said: 'He who obeys a creature in
	disobedience to the Creator, Allah appoints the. same c creature
	over him in power' . &quot; (Ahkam al-Qur an). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">'Allama
	Alusi says: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;This
	command refutes the view of those ignorant people who think that
	obedience to the ruler is absolutely necessary. Allah has restricted
	even obedience to His Messenger only in what is good, whereas the
	Messenger never enjoins anything but what is good. This is meant to
	warn the people that obedience to no one is lawful in disobedience
	to the Creator. &quot; (Ruh al-Ma ani). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus,
	this command in fact, is the foundation stone of the rule of law in
	Islam. The rule is that anything which is opposed to the law of
	Islam is a crime, and no one has the right to enjoin any such thing
	on any one. Anyone who enjoins anything against the law, is a
	culprit; and the one who obeys such a command is . also a culprit.
	No subordinate can escape the punishment on the basis of the excuse
	that his superior officer had ordered him to do something which was
	a crime in the law. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	thing which has great legal import is that in this verse after
	enjoining five prohibitions only one positive command has been
	given, namely that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)
	will be obeyed in all good things. As for the evils, the major evils
	in which women of the pre-Islamic days were generally involved, have
	been mentioned and a pledge taken from them to refrain from them.
	But as for the good works, they have neither been mentioned nor any
	pledge taken to observe them. The only pledge that has been taken is
	that they will have to obey the Holy Prophet in every good work that
	he enjoins. Now obviously, if the good works be only those which
	Allah Almighty has enjoined in the Qur'an,.the pledge should have
	been to the effect: &quot;You will not disobey Allah,&quot; or &quot;You
	will not disobey the injunctions of the Qur'an.&quot; But when the
	pledge taken was to the effect: &quot;You will not disobey any good
	work that is enjoined by the Messenger of Allah&quot;, it
	automatically leads to the conclusion that the Holy Prophet has been
	given vast powers for the reformation of society, and it is
	obligatory to obey all his commands, whether they are found in the
	Qur'an or not. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On the
	basis of this very legal authority the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) asked the women to pledge that they would refrain
	from all those evils which were prevalent among the women of .he
	Arabian society at that time, and gave several such commands as have
	not been mentioned in the Qur'an. One may study the following
	Ahadith in this connection

	allegiance.' He replied: 'I do not shake hands with women: I only
	make them take the pledge. So he made us to pledge.&quot; In another
	tradition she has stated: &quot;The Holy Prophet did not take the
	hand of any of us in his own hand. &quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Tirmidhi,
	Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Abu
	Da'ud, in Marasi, has related this from Sha'bi: &quot;While
	administering the oath of allegiance to the women, a sheet of cloth
	was stretched towards the Holy Prophet, which he took in his hand
	and said: `I do not take the woman's hand in my hand'.&quot; This
	same subject has been related by Ibn Abi Hatim from Sha'bi, by
	'Abdur Razzaq from Ibrahim Nakha`i and by Sa'id bin Mansur from Qais
	bin Abi Hazim. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Ibn
	Ishaq, in Maghazi has related this from Aban bin Salih.: &quot;The
	Holy Prophet would put his hand in a vessel full of water and then
	the woman also would put her hand in the same vessel. &quot; In
	Bukhari, a tradition from `Abdullah bin 'Abbas is to the effect:
	&quot;After giving the Eid congregational sermon, the Holy Prophet
	went through the rows of the then to the place where the women were
	sitting. There, in his address, he recited this verse of the Qur'an,
	then asked the women: `Do you promise to act according to it?' A
	woman from the assembly replied: `Yes, O Messenger of Allah'.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In a
	tradition related by Ibn Hibban, Ibn Jarir, Bazzar and others, Umm
	'Atiyyah Ansariah has stated this: &quot;The Holy Prophet extended
	his hand from outside the house and we extended our hands from
	inside the house. &quot; But this does not prove that the women
	might have shaken hands with the Holy Prophet, for Hadrat Umm
	`Atiyyah has not made any mention of the shaking of hands. Probably
	on this occasion for the purpose of taking the pledge the Holy
	Prophet might have extended his hand from outside and the women
	their hands from inside the house towards him without any of their
	hands touching his.</P>

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that they have despaired of their well-being and rewards in the
	Hereafter just as the deniers of the life-after-death have despaired
	of the resurrection of their near and dear ones, who are dead and
	gone into the graves. This meaning has been given by Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin 'Abbas and Hadrat Hasan Basri, Qatadah and Dahak (may
	Allah bless them). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second meaning can be: They have despaired of the mercy and
	forgiveness of the Hereafter just as the disbelievers, who are Iying
	in the graves, have despaired of every good, for they are certain of
	their being involved in the punishment. This meaning has been
	related from Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas'ud and from Mujahid, 'Ikrimah,
	Ibn Zaid, Kalbi, Muqatil, Mansur (may Allah bless them all).&nbsp;
