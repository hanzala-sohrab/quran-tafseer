according to Iman Suyuti. However, there are some traditions, on the
basis of which it is considered a Madani Surah, and they are as
follows: </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ibn
Abi Hatim has cited Abu Buraidah as saying that this Surah was sent
down concerning the two tribes, Bani Harithah and Bani al-Harth, of
the Ansar. The two tribes had first recounted the glories and
illustrious deeds of their living men; then they had gone to the
grave yard and bragged of the glorious deeds of their dead. Thereupon
the Divine Revelation </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Alhakum

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">came down. But, if the practice of the
Companions and their successors concerning the occasions of
revelation, is kept in view, this tradition is no argument to prove
that Surah At Takathur was sent down on that very occasion, but it
shows that this Surah fully applied to the act of the two tribes. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Imam
Bukhari and Ibn Jarir have cited this view of Hadrat Ubayy bin Ka'ab:

of Adam's belly cannot be filled but by earth, to be from the Quran

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">has been regarded as an argument for
Surah At-Takathur to be a Madani Surah on the ground that Hadrat
Ubayy had become a Muslim in Madinah. But Hadrat Ubayy's this
statement does not indicate in what sense the Companions regarded
this saying of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) as belonging to
the Quran. If it means that they regarded it as a verse of the Quran,
it cannot be acceptable, for a great majority of the Companions
consisted of the men who were well aware of each and every word of
the Quran; they could not have the misunderstanding that the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hadith</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">was a verse of the Quran. And if its
belonging to the Quran is taken to mean its being derived from the
Quran, the tradition can also mean that when the Companions who
entered Islam in Madinah, heard this Surah for the first time from
the Holy Prophet, they thought that it had been revealed just then,
and then about the Holy Prophet's above saying they formed the idea
that it was derived from this very Surah. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ibn
Jarir Tirmidhi, Ibn al Mundhir and other traditionists have related
this view of Hadrat Ali: &quot;We were in doubt about the torment of
the grave until </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Alhakum

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">was sent down.&quot; This view has
been regarded as an argument for Surah At-Takathur to be Madani on
the ground that the torment of the grave was first mentioned at
Madinah; no mention of it was ever made at Makkah. But this is wrong.
In the Makki Surahs of the Quran, the torment of the grave has been
mentioned at many places so clearly that there can he no room for any
such doubt; for example, see Al- An'am: 93, An-Nahl: 28, Al-Muminun:
99-100, Al-Mu'min: 45-46, which are all Makki Surahs. Therefore, if
anything is proved by Hadrat Ali's saying, it is that Surah
At-Takathur had been revealed before the revelation of the above
mentioned Makki Surahs and its revelation had removed the Companions
doubt about the torment of the grave. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>The
	words alhakum at-takathur of the original are too vast in meaning to
	be fully explained in a passage Alhakmn is from lahv which
	originally means heedlessness, but in Arabic this word is used for
	every occupation which engrosses man so completely that he becomes
	heedless of the more important things in life. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When the
	word alhakum is made from this root, it will mean that man has
	become so obsessed with some occupation that he has lost sight of
	everything more important than it. He is pre-occupied with it, is
	wholly lost in pursuit of it and this obsession has rendered him
	heedless of everything else in life. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Takathur
	is from kathrat, which has throe meanings: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	man should strive to gain more and more of everything; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	the people should vie with one another for gaining more and more;
	and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) that
	they should brag and boast of possessing greater abundance of things
	than others. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Therefore,
	alhakum at-takathur would mean: &quot; Takathur (greed for more and
	more) has so occupied you that its pursuit has made you heedless of
	every higher thing in life.&quot; In this sentence it has not been
	indicated as to abundance of what is meant in takathur, heedlessness
	of what is implied in alhakrun, and who are the addresses of
	alhakum. In the absence of such an explanation, the words become
	applicable in their most general and extensive meaning. Thus,
	takathur does not remain restricted in meaning and application but
	applies to all the gains and benefits, pleasures and comforts, the
	passion for acquiring more and more means of power and authority,
	vying with others in pursuit of these and bragging and boasting of
	their abundance. Likewise, the addressees of alhakum also do not
	remain limited but the people of all ages, in their individual as
	well as collective capacity, become its addressees. It gives the
	meaning that the passion for acquiring more and more of the worldly
	wealth, vying with others in pursuit of it and bragging and boasting
	of its possession has affected individuals as well as societies.
	Like wise, since in alhakum at-takathur it has not been pointed out
	as to which people are engrossed in acquisitiveness and of what they
	are rendered heedless, it has also become very extensive in meaning.
	It means that the passion for piling up more and more has made the
	people heedless of everything more important than it. They have
	become heedless of God, of the Hereafter, of the moral bounds and
	moral responsibilities, of the rights of others and of their own
	obligations to render those rights. They are only after raising the
	standard of living and do not bother even if the standard of
	humanity be falling. They want to acquire more and more of wealth no
	matter how and by what means it is acquired. They desire to have
	more and more means of comfort and physical enjoyment and,
	overwhelmed by this greed, they have become wholly insensitive as to
	the ultimate end of this way of living. They are engaged in a race
	with others to acquire more and more of power, more and more of
	forces, more and more of weapons, and they have no idea that all
	this is a means of filling God's earth with tyranny and wickedness
	and of destroying humanity itself. In short, takathur has many
	forms, which have engrossed individuals as well as societies so
	completely that they have become heedless of everything beyond the
	world, its benefits and pleasures.&nbsp;

	Allah. However, the people who did not show ingratitude but spent

	Abu Hurairah has reported that the Holy Prophet once asked Hadrat
	Abu Bakr and Hadrat `Umar to accompany him to the place of
	AbulHaitham bin at-Tahan Ansari. Thus, he took them to the oasis of
	Ibn at-Taihan-The latter brought a bunch of dates and placed it
	before them. The Holy Prophet said: &quot;Why didn't you pluck the
	dates yourself? ` He said: &quot;1 thought you would yourselves
	select and eat dates of your choice.&quot; So, they ate the dates
	and drank cool water. At the end, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;By
	Him in Whose hand is my life: this is of the blessings about which
	you will be questioned on the Resurrection Day: the cool shade, the
	cool dates, the cool water.&quot; (This tradition has been narrated
	in different ways by Muslim, Ibn Majah, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i,
	Ibn Jarir, Abu Ya`la and others, on the authority of Hadrat Abu
	Hurairah, in some of which the name of the Ansari Companion has been
	mentioned and in some he has been referred to as a person from among
	the Ansar. This incident has been related with several details by
	Ibn Abi Hatim from Hadrat `Umar and by Imam Ahmad from Abu `Asib,
	the Holy Prophet's freed slave. Ibn Hibban and Ibn Marduyah have
	related a tradition from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas, which shows
	that an almost similar thing had happened in the house of Hadrat Abu
	Ayyub Ansari. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These
	Ahadith make it explicit that not only the disbelievers but the
	righteous believers too will be questioned. As for the blessings
	which Allah has bestowed on man, they are unlimited and countless.
	There are many blessings of which man is not even conscious. The
	Qur'an says: &quot;If you try to count the blessings of Allah, you
	will not be able to calculate them.&quot; (Ibrahim : 34). Countless
	of them are the blessings which Allah has granted directly to man,
	and a large number of these are the blessings which man is granted
	through his own skill and endeavor. About the blessings that accrue
	to man in consequence of his own labor and skill, he will have to
	render an account as to how he acquired them and in what ways he
	expended them. In respect of the blessings directly bestowed by
	Allah, he will have to give an account as to how he used them. And
	in respect of all the blessings, on the whole, he will have to tell
