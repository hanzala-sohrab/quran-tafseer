<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
period of the revelation of the first section (vv. 1-8) is A. H. 7,
and probably it was sent down, on the occasion of the conquest of
Khaiber or soon after it. Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i and Ibn
Jarir have related on the authority of Hadrat Abu Hurairah that he
and other Companions were sitting in the Holy Prophet's assembly when
these verses were revealed. About Abu Hurairah it is confirmed
historically that he entered Islam after the truce of Hudaibiyah and
before the conquest of Khaiber, and Khaiber was conquered, according
to Ibn Hisham, in Muharram, and, according to Ibn Sa`d, in Jamadi
al-Awwal, A.H. 7. Thus presumably Allah might have sent down these
verses, addressing the Jews, when their last stronghold had fallen to
the Muslims, or these might have been revealed when, seeing the fate
of Khaiber, all the Jewish settlements of northern Hijaz had
surrendered to the Islamic government. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
second section (vv. 9-11) was sent down shortly after the emigration,
for the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) had established the
Friday congregational Prayer on the 5th day after his arrival at
Madinah. The incident that has been referred to in the last verse of
this section must have occurred at a time when the people had not yet
received full training in the etiquette of religious congregations. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
we have explained above, the two sections of this Surah were sent
down in two different periods. That is why their themes as well as
their audiences are different. Although there is a kind of harmony
between them on account of which they have been put together in one
Surah, yet we should understand their themes separately before we
consider the question of their harmony. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
first section was sent down at a time when all Jewish efforts to
obstruct the message of Islam during the past six years had failed.
First. in Madinah as many as three of their powerful tribes had done
whatever they could to frustrate the mission of the Holy Prophet,
with the result that one of the tribes was completely exterminated
and the other two were exiled. Then by intrigue and conspiracy they
brought many of the Arab tribes together to advance on Madinah, but
in the Battle of the Trench they were all repulsed. After this,
Khaiber had become their stronghold, where a large number of the Jews
expelled from Madinah also had taken refuge. At the time these verses
were revealed, that too was taken without any extraordinary effort,
and the Jews at their own request agreed to live there as tenants of
the Muslims. After this final defeat the Jewish power in Arabia came
to an end. Then, Wad-il-Qura, Fadak, Taima', Tabuk, all surrendered
one after the other, so much so that all Arabian Jews became subdued
to the same Islam which they were not prepared to tolerate before.
This was the occasion when Allah Almighty once again addressed them
in this Surah, and probably this was the last and final address that
was directed to them in the Qur'an. In this they have been reminded
of three things: </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
is the subject-matter of the first section. The second section that
was sent down many years later, was appended to this Surah because in
it Allah has bestowed Friday on the Muslims as against the Sabbath of
the Jews, and Allah wanted to warn the Muslims not to treat their
Friday as the Jews had treated their Sabbath. This section was sent
down on an occasion when a trade caravan arrived in Madinah right at
the time of the Friday congregational service and hearing its din and
drum the audience, except for 12 men, left the Prophet's Mosque and
rushed out to the caravan, although the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
Allah's peace) at that time was delivering the Sermon. Thereupon it
was enjoined that after the call is sounded for the Friday Prayer all
trade and business and other occupations become forbidden. The
believers should then suspend every kind of transaction and hasten to
the remembrance of Allah. However, when the Prayer is over, they have
the right to disperse in the land to resume their normal occupations.
This section could be made an independent Surah in view of the
commandments that it contains about the congregational service on
Friday, and could also be included in some other Surah, but, instead,
it has been included here particularly in the verses in which the
Jews have been warned of the causes of their evil end. Its wisdom in
our opinion is the same as we have explained above. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>For
	explanation, sec E.N.'s 1, 2 of Surah AI-Hadid, and E.N.'s 36, 37,
	41 of Surah AI-Hashr above. This introduction bears a deep relevance
	to the theme that follows. In spite of the fact that the Jews of
	Arabia were witnessing clear signs of Prophethood in the person of
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and his high character
	and works and in spite of the clear good news given by the Prophet
	Moses (peace be upon him) in the Torah, which only applied to him,
	they were denying him only because they did not want to acknowledge
	the prophet hood of a person who did not belong to their own
	community and race. They openly proclaimed that they would believe
	only in that which had come to them, and would not accept any
	teaching, which came through a non-Israelite prophet, even if it was
	from God. For this attitude in the following verses they have been
	reproved. Hence the reason for beginning the discourse with the
	introductory sentence. First, it says that everything in the
	universe is glorifying Allah; that is, the entire universe testifies
	that Allah is free from all those faults and weaknesses because of
	which the Jews have formed the concept of their racial superiority.
	He is not related to anyone: He has nothing to do with favoritism:
	He treats all His creatures with equal justice, mercy and care. No
	particular race and nation is His favorite so that He may be bound
	to bless it whatever it may do; and He is not prejudiced against any
	race or nation so that He may deprive it of His bounties even if it
	possesses all the good qualities. Then, it says that He is the
	Sovereign; that is, no worldly power can restrict His authority and
	powers, as if to say: &quot;You, O Jews, are His servants and
	subjects. 'It is not for you to decide whom He should appoint His
	Messenger, and whom He should not, for your guidance. &quot; Then it
	says that He is Holy; that is, HE is far exalted and glorified that
	His judgments may be mistaken. Human judgments may have mistakes but
	His decrees are perfect. In the end, two more attributes of Allah
	have been mentioned: that He is All-Mighty, i.e. none can fight Him
	and win and that He is All-Wist, i.e. whatever He does, it is always
	the very demand of wisdom, and His plans and designs are so
	well-planned that none in the world can hinder and frustrate them.&nbsp;

	Allah has raised a Messenger among the Arabs whom the Jews
	contemptuously consider the gentiles and much below themselves, The
	Messenger has not risen of his own wish and will, but has been
	raised by Him Who is the Sovereign of the universe, Who is
	All-Mighty and All-Wise, Whose power can be resisted and opposed
	only to one's own loss and peril. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One
	should know that the word ummi has occurred in the Qur'an at several
	places but in different meanings at different places. At one place
	it has been used for the people who do not possess any revealed
	scripture, which they may he following, as AI-'Imran: 20, where it
	'has been said: &quot;Ask those who possess the Book and those who
	do not possess (umnris); 'Have you accepted Islam`''&quot; Here, the
	ummis imply the Arab polytheists, and they have been regarded as a
	separate class from the followers of the Book, i.e. the Jews and the
	Christians. At another place, it has been used for the illiterate
	people among the Jews and Christians, who are ignorant of the Book
	of Allah, as in Al-Baqarah: 78: &quot;Among the Jews there are some
	illiterate people (ummis) who have no knowledge of the Book but are
	guided by mere conjecture and guess-work. &quot; At still another
	place, this word has been used purely as a Jewish term, which
	implies all the non-Jewish people, as in Al-'Imran: 75: (The actual
	cause of this dishonesty of theirs is that they say:) We are not to
	be called to account for out behavior towards the non-Jews (ummis)
	This third meaning of ummi is implied in the verse tinder
	discussion. It is a synonym of the Hebrew word goyim, which has been
	translated gentiles in the English Bible and implies all the
	non-Jewish or the non-Israelite people of the world. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But the
	real significance of this Jewish term cannot be understood only by
	this explanation of it. The Hebrew word goyim originally was used
	only in the meaning of a nation, but gradually the Jews reserved it
	first for the nation other then themselves, then they gave it the
	special meaning that all the nations other than the Jews were
	un-civilized, irreligious, unclean and contemptible; so much so that
	in its connotations of hatred and contempt this word even surpassed
	the Greek term 'barbarian' which they used for all the non-Greeks.
	In rabbinical literature, goyim are such contemptible people, who
	cannot be considered human, who cannot be made companions in a
	journey, who cannot be saved even if one of them is drowning. The
	Jews believed that the Messiah of the future would destroy all the
	goyim and burn them to annihilation. (For further explanation, see
	E.N. 64 of Al-'Imran).&nbsp;

	characteristics of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be piece) have been
	mentioned at four places in the Qur'an and everywhere with a
	different object. These have been mentioned in AI-Baqarah: t29 to
	tell the Arabs that the mission of the Prophet, which they were
	regarding as a calamity and affliction for themselves, was indeed a
	great blessing for which the Prophets Abraham and Ishmael (peace be
	upon them) had been praying for their children. In Al-Baqarah: 151
	these have been mentioned to exhort the Muslims to recognize the
	true worth of the Holy Prophet and to derive full benefit from the
	blessing which they had been granted in the form of his Apostleship.
	These have been reiterated in AI 'Imran: 164 to make the hypocrites
	and the people of weak faith realize what great favor Allah had done
	them by raising His Messenger among them, and how foolish they were
	in not appreciating this. Now, here in this Surah these have been
	repeated for the fourth time with the object to tell the Jews: 'The
	mission that Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessing) is
	performing in front of you, is evidently the mission of a Messenger.
	He is reciting the Revelations of Allah, the language, themes and
	style of which testify that these arc indeed Divine Revelations. He
	is purifying and reforming the lives of the people, cleansing their
	morals and habits And dealings of every evil element, and adorning
	them with the finest moral qualities. This is the same task which
	all the Prophets before him have been performing. Then he does not
	rest content only with the recitation of the Revelations, but he is
	making the people understand the real aim of the Divine Book by word
	and deed and by the practical model of his life and imparting to
	them the wisdom and knowledge which none but the Prophets have
	imparted so far. This very character and way of life and practical
	model is the conspicuous characteristic of the Prophets by which
	they are recognized. Then how stubborn you arc that you refuse to
	recognize and believe in the Messenger whose truth is manifestly
	proved by his wonderful works only because Allah has not raised him
	among you but among the people whom you call the ummis (gentiles).&nbsp;

	point is noteworthy. It has not been said: &quot;O Jews&quot;. but
	&quot;O you who have became Jews, or who have adopted Judaism&quot;,
	the reason being that the way of life brought by the Prophet Moses
	(peace be on him) and the Prophets after and before him, was Islam
	itself. None of those Prophets was a Jew, nor bad Judaism been born
	in their time, but Judaism as such came into being much later. It is
	ascribed to the tribe which descended from Judah, the fourth son of
	the Prophet Jacob (peace be upon him). When after the Prophet
	Solomon (peace be upon him) his kingdom broke into two parts, this
	tribe became ruler over the state which came to be known as Judea.
	The other tribes of the Israelites established their separate state
	which became famous as Samaria. Then Assyria not only destroyed
	Samaria but also wiped out those Israelite tribes which had founded
	that state. After that only the decedents of Judah besides those of
	Benjamin remained. Who because of the predominance of the
	descendants of Judah, began to be called the &quot;Jews&quot;.
	Judaism is the name of the framework of the doctrines, customs, and
	religious rules and regulations which the priests, rabbis and
	learned men of this race prepared according to their own ideas,
	theories and trends for many centuries. This framework started being
	shaped in the 4th century B.C. and continued to develop till the 5th
	century A.D. It contains a very small element of the Divine guidance
	brought by the Messengers of Allah, and even that element has been
	corrupted That is why at many places in the Qur'an they have been
	addressed as alladhina hadu &quot;O you who have become Jews&quot;.

	converts who had embraced Judaism. .Whenever in the Qur'an the

	the Muslims and the Jews. In this Surah it was reiterated at the
	time when after several battles their power in Arabia had been
	finally and absolutely, crushed. These battles and their results
	proved by experience and observation that what had been said in
	AI-Baqarah was correct. In Madinah and Khaiber the Jewish strength
	was much superior to that of the Muslims both in numbers and in
	resources. Then they had the pagans of Arabia and the hypocrites of
	Madinah also as their allies who were bent upon wiping out the
	Muslims. But in spite of this great disparity in numbers the Muslims
	overwhelmed the Jews mainly because they were least afraid of dying
	for the cause of Allah; they were rather fond of it, and would enter
	the battlefield fully prepared to embrace death. For they believed
	that they were fighting in the way of God and had complete faith
	that the one who fell martyr in His way would be blessed with
	Paradise. Contrary to this, the Jews were not prepared to fight and
	lay down their life for any cause, neither the cause of God, nor the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	it contains mention of the call to the Prayer; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	the mention is of the call to such a Prayer as has to be performed
	particularly only on Fridays; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) that
	these things have not been mentioned so as to suggest that the call
	is to be made for the Prayer and a particular Prayer is to be
	performed on Friday, but the style and context clearly show that the
	call to the Prayer and the particular Prayer were both already being
	performed and practiced on Friday. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	people, however were being negligent in that on hearing the call to
	the Prayer they would not hasten to it but would remain occupied in
	their worldly activities and trade and business transactions.
	Therefore, Allah sent down this verse to make the people realize and
	appreciate the importance of the call and the Prayer and to exhort
	them to hasten to perform it as a duty. If these three things are
	considered deeply, they prove this truth absolutely that Allah
	conjoined on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) certain Commands
	which were not revealed in the Qur'an, and these Commands too wen as
	obligatory as those revealed in the (Qur'an itself. The call to the
	Prayer is the same adhan which is being called the world over five
	times daily in every mosque. But neither its words have been stated
	anywhere in the Qur'an nor the method of calling the people to the
	Prayer has been taught. Its method was prescribed by the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace). The Qur'an has only confirmed it
	twice, here and in AI-Ma'idah: 58. Like wise, this particular Prayer
	of Friday, which the Muslims of the whole world are performing today
	has neither been enjoined in the Qur'an nor its time and method of
	performance described anywhere. This me hod too was prescribed by'
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace), and this verse of the Qur'an
	was sent down only to stress its importance and obligatory nature.
	In spite of this express argument anyone who claims that the Shari
	ah commandments are only those which have been stated in the Qur'an,
	is not in fact a denier of the Sunnah but of the Qur'an itself. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Before
	proceeding further, Iet us understand a few other things also about
	Jumu-uh (the Friday congregational Prayer): 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Jumu'ah is an Islamic term. In the pre-Islamic days of ignorance the
	Arabs called it the 'Arabah Day. In Islam when it was declared as a
	congregational day of the Muslims, it was re-named Jumu ah. Although
	according to the historians, Ka`b bin Luayy, or Qusayy bin Kilab,
	also had used this name for this day, for he used to hold an
	assembly of Quraish on this day (Fath-al-Bati), yet by this practice
	the ancient name did not change, and the common Arabs continued to
	call it the 'Arabah Day. The real change took place when Islam gave
	it this new name. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Before Islam, setting aside of a day in the week for worship and
	regarding it as an emblem of the community was prevalent among the
	followers of the earlier scriptures. Among the Jews the Sabbath
	(Saturday) had been fixed for this purpose, because on this day
	Allah had delivered the children of Israel from the bondage of the
	Pharaoh. In order to distinguish themselves from the Jews the
	Christians took Sunday as their distinctive emblem. Although it had
	neither been enjoined by the Prophet Jesus nor mentioned anywhere in
	the Gospel, yet the Christians believe that after his death on the
	Cross the Prophet Jesus had risen from the grave on this day and
	ascended to heaven. On this very basis the later Christians ordained
	it as the day of worship, and then in 321 A.D. the Roman Empire
	instituted it as a holiday by decree. In order to distinguish its
	community from both these communities, Islam adopted Friday as the
	day of collective worship as against Saturday and Sunday. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) It is
	known from the tradition reported by Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud and
	Hadrat Abu Mas'ud Ansari that the Friday congregational Prayer had
	been enjoined on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be-peace some time)
	before the Hijrah in Makkah itself. But at that time he could not
	act on it, for in Makkah it was not possible to perform any worship
	collectively. Therefore, he sent a written instruction to the people
	who had emigrated to Madinah before him that they should establish
	the Friday congregational Prayer there. Thus, Hadrat Mus`ab bin
	`Umair, the leader of the earliest emigrants, offered the first
	Friday Prayer at Madinah with 12 followers. (Tabarani, Daraqutni).
	Hadrat Ka`b bin Malik and Ibn Sirin have reported that even before
	this the Muslims of Madinah had decided mutually, on their own
	initiative, that they would hold a collective service on one day in
	the week. For this purpose they had selected Friday as against the
	Sabbath of the Jews and Sunday of the Christians, and the first
	Friday Prayer was led by Hadrat Asad bin Zurarah at the place of
	Bani Bayadah and 40 Muslims participated in it. (Musnad Ahmad Abu
	Da'ud, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban, `Abd bin Humaid, 'Abdur Razzaq,
	Baihaqi). This shows that the Islamic taste and trend at that time
	was itself demanding that there should be a day on which maximum
	number of Muslims should gather together and worship collectively.
	And this also was a demand of the Islam itself that it should be a
	day other than Saturday and Sunday so that the symbol of the Muslim
	community should be distinctive from the emblems of the Jewish and
	the Christian communities. This was a wonderful manifestation of the
	Islamic trends and tastes of the Holy Prophet's Companions that many
	a time it so happened that even before a thing was enjoined their
	taste proclaimed that the spirit of Islam demanded its introduction.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	establishment of the Friday congregational Prayer was one of the
	earliest things that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) did after
	his emigration to Madinah. After leaving Makkah he reached Quba' on
	Monday and stayed there for four days. On the fifth day, which was a
	Friday, he preceded to Madinah. On the way at the place of Bani
	Salim bin `Auf tim came for the Friday Prayer and he performed the
	first Friday congregational Prayer at this very place. (Ibn Hisham).
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) The
	time appointed by the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) for
	this Prayer was after the declining of the sun, the same time which
	is for the Zuhr Prayer. The written instruction that he had sent to
	Hadrat Mus'ab bin `Umair before the hijrah was: &quot;Seek nearness
	to Allah by means of two rakahs of the Prayer when the sun declines
	after midday on Friday. &quot; (Daraqutni). This same instruction he
	gave orally after hijrah as well as practically led the Friday
	Prayer at the same time. Traditions on this Subject have been
	related on the authority of Hadrat Anas, Hadrat Salamah bin Akwa',
	Hadrat Zubair bin al-`Awwam, Hadrat Sahl bin Sa'd, Hadrat `Abdullah
	bin Mas`ud, Hadrat `Ammar bin Yasr and Hadrat Bilal in the
	collection of Hadith, saying that the Holy Prophet used to perform
	the Friday Prayer after the declining of the sun: (Musnad Ahmad
	Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) This
	also is confirmed by his practice that on this day the Holy Prophet
	led the Friday congregational Prayer instead of the Zuhr Prayer, and
	this Prayer consisted of two rak ahs and he gave the Sermon before
	it. This was the only difference between the Friday Prayer and the
	Zuhr Prayer on other days. Hadrat `Umar says: &quot;According to the
	command enjoined by the tongue of your Prophet (upon whom be Allah's
	peace) the traveler's Prayer consists of two rak ahs, the Fajr
	Prayer consists of two rakahs, and the Friday Prayer consists of two
	rak ahs. This is the complete, not the shortened, Prayer, and the
	Friday Prayer has been shortened only because of the Sermon.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) The
	call to the Prayer that has been mentioned here, implies the call
	that is made just before the Sermon. and not the call that is made
	much before the Sermon to announce that the prayer time has begun.
	There is a tradition in the Hadith from Hadrat Sa'ib bin Yazid to
	the effect that in the time of the Holy Prophet there used to be
	only one call that was made after the Imam (leader in Prayer) had
	taken his seat on the pulpit. The same practice also continued in
	the time of Hadrat Abu Bakr and Hadrat 'Umar. When population
	increased in the time of Hadrat 'Uthman, he ordered another call to
	be made in the bazaar of Madinah at his house, Az-Zaura'. (Bukhari,
	Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Tabarani).&nbsp;

	this Command &quot;remembrance&quot; implies the Friday Sermon, for
	the first thing that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) used to
	do after the call was to deliver the Sermon, and the Prayer he led
	always after delivering the sermon Hadrat Abu Hurairah has reported
	that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: &quot;The angels on
	Friday go on writing down the names of the people as they arrive.
	Then, when the Imam comes out to deliver the Sermon, they stop
	writing the names and turn their attention to the remembrance (i.e.
	the Sermon),&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud,
	Tirmidhi, Nasa'i). This Hadith also shows that the remembrance
	implies the Sermon. The exhortation of the Qur'an itself points to
	the same thing. First, it says: &quot;Hasten to the remembrance of
	Allah&quot;; then a little below it says: &quot;Then, when the
	Prayer is over, disperse in the land. &quot; This shows that on
	Friday the order of the service is that first there is the
	remembrance of Allah and then the Prayer. The commentators are also
	agreed that remembrance either implies the Sermon, or the Sermon and
	the Prayer both. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Using the
	word &quot;dhikr-Allah &quot; for the Sermon by itself gives the
	meaning chat it should contain themes relevant to the remembrance of
	Allah; for instance, praising and glorifying .Allah, imploring Him
	to bless His Messenger, exhorting and instructing the audience to
	obey His Commands and follow His Shari Ah, commending His pious and
	righteous servants, etc. On this very basis, Zamakhshari writes in
	al-kashshaf 'Praising the wicked and tyrannical rules in the Friday
	Sermon, or mentioning their names and praying for them, has nothing
	to do with the remembrance of Allah; this would be the remembrance
	of Satan. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hasten to
	the remembrance of Allah&quot; does not mean that one should come to
	the mosque running, but it means that one should make haste for it.
	The commentators are also agreed on this very meaning. &quot;Hastening&quot;
	according to them means that on hearing the call one should
	immediately start making. preparations to attend the mosque. The
	Hadith even forbids coming to the mosque for the Prayer muting.
	Hadrat Abu Hurairah has reported that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) said: &quot;When the Prayer has begun, one should
	conic walking to it with calm and dignity, and not running. Then,
	one should join in whatever remains of the Prayer, and should make
	up whatever one has missed independently later. &quot; (Sihah;
	Sittah Hadrat Abu Qatadah Ansari says: &quot;Once we were offering
	the Prayer under the leadership of the Holy Prophet when suddenly we
	heard some people coming to join the Prayer running. When the Prayer
	was concluded, the Holy Prophet asked: What was the noise about?
	They replied; We came running for the Prayer. The Holy Prophet said;
	Don't do that: whenever you come for the Prayer, come with calm and
	dignity. Join behind the Imam in whatever remains of the Prayer, and
	make up whatever you have missed independently.&quot; (Bukhari,
	Muslim) 'Leave off your trading&quot; also includes every other
	worldly activity and business which prevent one from getting ready
	for the Prayer with full attention and care. &quot;Buying and
	selling&quot; has been particularly forbidden, for commerce
	flourished on Fridays. People from the surrounding areas gathered
	together at a central place, the merchants also arrived with their
	merchandise, and the people became occupied in buying the
	necessities of daily use The prohibition however is not restricted
	only to buying and selling, but it applies to all other occupations
	as well. And since Allah has forbidden these, jurists of Islam are
	agreed that after the call has been sounded for the Friday Prayer
	all forms of trade, business and worldly occupation become
	forbidden. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	Command absolutely confirms the obligatory nature of the Friday
	Prayer. In the first place, the exhortation to hasten for it after
	one has heard the call, is by itself a proof of its being
	obligatory. Then, the prohibition of a lawful thing like trade and
	business at the time of the Prayer also shows that it is obligatory
	in nature Moreover, the elimination of the obligatory Zuhr Prayer on
	Friday and its being replaced by the Friday Prayer, is a clear proof
	that it is obligatory in nature. For an obligatory duty becomes
	eliminated only when the duty replacing it is more important. This
	very thing has been supported in many Hadiths, in which the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) exhorted the Muslims in most
	emphatic words to attend the Friday Prayer and has declared it in
	clear words to be obligatory. Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud has
	reported that the Holy Prophet said: 'I feel I should ask somebody
	to stand in my place to Iced the Prayer, and I myself should go and
	set fire to the houses of the people who do not come for the Prayer.
	&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Bukhari). Hadrat Abu Hurairah, Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin 'Abbas and Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Umar say: &quot;We
	heard the Holy Prophet say this ' in the Friday Sermon, The people
	should refrain from giving up the Friday Prayer; otherwise Allah
	will seal up hearts and they will become totally heedless.&quot;
	(Musnad Ahmad, Muslim, Nasa'i). From the traditions reported by
	Hadrat Abu al-Ja'd Damri, Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah and Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin Abi Aufa from the Holy Prophet one comes to know that
	Allah seals &frac12;p the heart of the person who abandons three
	Friday Prayers, one after the other, without a genuine reason and
	lawful excuse. Rather in one tradition the words arc to the effect:
	&quot;Allah turns the heart of such a one into the heart of a
	hypocrite.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Nasa`i, Tirmidhi Ibn
	Majah Darimi, Hakim, Ibn Hibban, Bazzar, Tabarani in al-Kabir.
	Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah says that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;From
	today till Resurrection the Friday Prayer is obligatory on you.
	Allah will neither bless nor set right the condition of the one who
	abandons it disregarding it or considering it an ordinary thing.
	Note it well: the Prayer of such a one will be no, prayer at all,
	his zakat will be no zakat at all, his Hajj no Hajj, his fasting no
	fasting, and no good done by him will be good, until he repents.
	Then, for the one who repents, Allah is Most Forgiving.&quot; (Ibn
	Majah, Bazzar). Another tradition, which is very close in meaning to
	this, has been cited by Tabarani in Auset from Ibn 'Umar, Furthemore
	there arc many traditions in which the Holy Prophet has declared the
	Friday Prayer as obligatory in clear words. Hadrat 'Abdullah bin
	'Amr bin al-'As has related that the Holy Prophet said: 'The Friday
	Prayer is obligatory on every person who hears the call to it.&quot;
	(Abu Da'ud Daraqutni). Jabir bin 'Abdullah and Abu Sa'id Khudri say
	that he said in a Sermon: &quot;Know that Allah has enjoined the
	Friday Prayer as a duty on you (Baihaqi). However, He has exempted
	the women, children, slaves, the sick and the travellers from this
	duty. Hadrat Hafsah has reported that the Holy Prophet said:
	&quot;Attendance at the Friday Prayer is obligatory on every adult
	male.&quot; (Nasa'i). Hadrat Tariq bin Shihab's tradition contains
	this saying of the Holy Prophet: &quot;The Friday congregational
	Prayer is obligatory on every Muslim except the slave, women,
	children and the sick.&quot; (Abu Da'ud, Hakim). In the tradition of
	Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah, his words are to the effect: &quot;Friday
	Prayer is obligatory on the person who believes in Allah and the
	Last Day unless it is a woman, or a traveler, or a slave, or a sick
	man.&quot; (Daraqutni, Baihaqi). On account of these very
	exhortations of the Qur'an and the Hadith. the entire Ummah is
	agreed that the Friday congregational Prayer is of obligatory
	nature.&nbsp;

	does not mean that after the Friday is over, it is obligatory to go
	in search of livelihood. but it only implies permission. As it was
	ordered to stop all worldly business as soon as the call was made
	for the Prayer, so it is allowed that after the Prayer is over, the
	people may dispose and resume or pursue whatever occupation or
	business they may like. It is just like the prohibition of hunting
	in the state of ihram, but after ihram is put off, one is told to
	hunt. (AI-Ma'idah: 2). That does not mean that one must hunt, but
	that one may hunt if one so likes. Or, for instance. in Surah
	An-Nisa', permission to marry more than one wife has been given,
	saying: &quot;Marry two or three or four women whom you 'choose. &quot;
	Here, although the verb is in the imperative mood, no one has taken
	it in the meaning of a command This gives the principle that the
	imperative form of the verb does not always imply an obligation or
	command it sometimes implies the permission and sometimes exercise
	of choice or preference. The context determines where it implies the
	command, where the permission and where Allah's approval of the act,
	and not that the act is obligatory. Immediately after this very
	sentence itself, it has been said: &quot;And remember Allah much. &quot;
	Here also the verb is in the imperative mood, but obviously it
	implies exercise of one's choice and not that it is a duty or
	compulsion. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here,
	another thing worthy of mention is that although in the Qur'an
	Friday has not been declared a public holiday like the Jewish
	Sabbath and the Christian Sunday, yet no one can deny that Friday is
	a symbol of the Muslim community precisely in the same way as
	Saturday is a Jewish and Sunday a Christian symbol. And if declaring
	a day in the week a public holiday be a cultural necessity, then
	just as the Jews naturally select Saturday for it and the Christians
	Sunday, so a Muslim (if he has any Islamic feeling) will necessarily
	select only Friday for this purpose. The Christians did not even
	hesitate to impose their Sunday on some other countries where
	Christian population was negligible. When the Jews established their
	state in Palestine, the first thing they did was to announce
	Saturday as the weekly holiday instead of Sunday. In prepartitioned
	India one conspicuous distinction between British India and the
	Muslim states was that in one part of the country Sunday was
	observed as a closed holiday and in the other Friday. However, where
	the Muslims lack Islamic values, they hold to Sunday even after
	attaining to sovereign power as we see in Pakistan. In case of
	excessive westernization Friday is replaced by Sunday as the weekly
	holiday as was done by Mustafa Kamal in Turkey.</P>

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>According
	to the Hanafi school of thought, the time for the Friday Prayer is
	the same as for Zuhr Prayer. The Friday Prayer can neither be held
	before it nor after it. Business and trade become forbidden with the
	first call to the Prayer and not with the second call which is made
	after the Imam has taken his place on the pulpit, for the words of
	the Qur'an in this regard are explicit and definite. Therefore,
	whichever call is made for the Friday Prayer after the declining of
	the sun when the Prayer time begins, the people should stop
	conducting business on hearing it. However, if a person has made a
	bargain at that time, it will not be void, but will only be a sin.
	The Friday Prayer cannot be held in every settlement but only in the
	misr Jami which has been defined as a large town or city, where
	there arc market places, adequate security arrangements, and which
	has large enough population so that if all the people upon whom
	attendance at the Friday Prayer is obligatory, gather together, they
	should be too many for the principal mosque to hold. The people who
	live outside the city will have to offer the Prayer in the city only
	in case the call to the Prayer reaches them, or if they live within
	six miles of the city. The Prayer may not necessarily be held in the
	mosque; it may also be held in the open field and also on a ground
	which is outside the city but a part of it. The Friday Prayer can be
	validly held only in a place where any and every person may come to
	attend it without any hindrance. It will not be valid if it is held
	in a restricted place where every person is not allowed to join in
	no matter how many people may gather together. For the Prayer to be
	valid there should at least be three men (according to Imam Abu
	Hanifah beside the Imam, or two men including the Imam (according to
	Imams Abu Yusuf and Mohammad), upon whom it is obligatory to attend
	the Friday Prayer. A person will be exempt from the Prayer if he is
	on a journey, or is so ill that he cannot walk to attend it, or is
	disabled of both the legs, or is blind (but according to Imam Abu
	Yusuf and Imam Muhammad, a blind person will be exempt from the
	Prayer duty only in case he does not find a man who can take him
	along for the Prayer), or he apprehends a danger to he life and
	honor, or an unbearable financial loss from a tyrant, or It is
	raining heavily and there is slush and rainwater on the way, or he
	is a. prisoner, For the prisoner and the disabled, it is undesirable
	that they should perform the Zuhr Prayer on Friday In congregation.
	For those also who have missed the Friday Prayer it is undesirable
	to perform the Zuhr Prayer collectively, The sermon is one of the
	pre-requisites of the Friday Prayer to be valid, for the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace) never performed the Friday Prayer
	without the Sermon; the Sermon must necessarily precede the prayer,
	and there should be two Sermons. From the time the Imam steps
	towards the pulpit for the sermon, every kind of speech becomes
	forbidden till he brings it to an end; no prayer may be performed
	during it, whether one can hear the Imam at the place where one is
	sitting or not. (Hedayah, Al-Fath ul-Qadir; al-Jassas: Ahkam

	to the Shafe'is the time of the Friday Prayer is the same as of the
	Zuhr Prayer. Trade and business become forbidden and hastening to
	the remembrance of Allah becomes obligatory from the time the second
	call is sounded, i.e. the call which is sounded after the Imam has
	taken his place on the pulpit. However, if A person carries out a
	transaction at this time, it does not become void. The Friday Prayer
	can be held in every such settlement among the permanent residents
	of which there are 40 such men upon whom it is incumbent to perform
	the Prayer. Attendance at the Friday Prayer is obligatory for, those
	people of the suburbs whom the call may reach The Friday service
	must be held within the bounds of the settlement, but it may not
	necessarily be held in the mosque. Thus, it is not obligatory for
	nomadic peoples who live in tents, in the desert. For the Prayer to
	be valid there should at least be 40 such men including the Imam in
	the congregation upon whom the Prayer is incumbent. A person would
	be exempt from the Prayer if he is on a journey, or intends to stay
	at a place for four or less than four days provided that the journey
	is lawful, or he is old or sick and cannot go to attend the Prayer

	take him along for the Prayer, or apprehends danger to lift or
	property or honor, or is a prisoner provided that this imprisonment
	has not been caused by his own crime. There should be two sermons
	before the Prayer. Although it is according to the Sunnah to sit
	quiet during the sermon, yet speech is not forbidden. For the person
	who is sitting close to the Imam so that he can hear the sermon,
	speech is disapproved, but he can respond to a greeting, and can
	recite prayer on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) aloud
	when he hears his name being mentioned. (Mughni al-Muhtaj Al-Fiqh

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>According
	to the Malikis, the Friday Prayer time begins from the declining of
	the sun and lasts till such time in the evening that the Sermon and
	the Prayer can be concluded before sunset. Business transactions
	become forbidden and hastening becomes obligatory with the second
	call. If a transaction takes place after it, it would be void and
	sinful. The Friday Prayer can be held in the settlements, residents
	of which live in permanent houses and do not migrate in the summer
	or the winter, and whose needs and requirements are met in the same
	settlements, and who can defend themselves on the basis of their
	strength. In temporary dwelling places the Friday 'Prayer cannot be
	established even though many people may be staying there and staying
	for long periods. Attendance at the Prayer is obligatory for the
	people who live within- three miles of the settlement where the
	Prayer is held. The Prayer can be held only in the mosque, which is
	inside the settlement or adjoining it, and the building of which is
	not inferior to the houses of the common residents of the place.
	Some Malikis have also imposed the condition that the mosque should
	be roofed, and arrangements for offering collective Prayer five
	times daily should also exist in it However, the better known view
	of the Malikis is that for the Prayer to be valid the mosque's being
	roofed is no pre-requisite. The Friday Prayer can also be held in a
	mosque which has been built only for the Friday Prayer and no
	arrangements exist in it for the five daily Prayers. For the Prayer
	to be valid there must at least be 12 other men, apart from the
	Imam, in the congregation upon whom the Friday Prayer is incumbent.
	A person would be exempt from it if he is on a journey, or intends
	to stay for Less than four days at a place during the journey, or is
	so ill that he cannot come to the mosque, or has an ailing mother or
	father, or wife, or child, or he is nursing a stranger who has
	nobody else to nurse him, or has a close relative who is seriously
	ill, or at the point of death, or apprehends an unbearable loss to
	property, or a danger to his life or honor, or is hiding from fear
	of imprisonment, or punishment, provided that he is a wronged and
	oppressed person, or it is raining heavily and there is slush and
	rainwater on the way, or the weather is oppressive due to excessive
	heat or cold. The Prayer has to be preceded by two Sermons; so much
	so that if the Sermon is given after the Prayer, the Prayer has to
	be repeated, and the Sermons must necessarily be delivered inside
	the mosque. It is forbidden to offer a voluntary Prayer after the
	Imam has stepped towards the pulpit, land to talk when the Sermon
	has begun, even if one is not hearing it, However, if the Imam
	indulges in meaningless and absurd things in the Sermon, or uses
	abusive language for a person who does not deserve it, or starts
	praising a, person for whom praise is unlawful, or starts reciting
	something irrelevant to the Sermon, the people have the right to
	protest. Furthermore, it is reprehensible that a prayer be made in
	the Sermon for the temporal ruler, unless the Imam apprehends danger
	to his life. The Imam must necessarily be the same person who leads
	the Prayer; if another person than the one who gave the Sermon led
	the Prayer it would be void. (Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi ila-sh-Sharh

	A transaction contracted after it has no effect in the law. The
	Prayer can be held only at a place where 40 men on whom the Friday
	Prayer is incumbent have permanently settled in houses (and not in
	tents) and are not nomadic tribesmen. For this purpose, it will not

	is the incident because of which the commandments pertaining to the
	Friday congregational Prayer have been enjoined in the preceding
	verses. Its narrative as related in the collections of Hadith, on
	the authority of Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin
	`Abbas, Hadrat Abu Hurairah, Hadrat Abu Malik, and Hasan Basri, lbn
	Zaid, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan is as follows: A trade caravan
	from Syria arrived in Madinah right at the time of the Friday Prayer
	and its people started playing their drums to announce their
	arrival. The Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) at that time
	was delivering the Sermon, Hearing the drum the people in the
	congregation became impatient and rushed out towards Baqi where the
	caravan had halted, except for 12 men. The most authentic tradition
	in this narrative is of Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah, which has been
	related by Imam Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, Abu 'Uwanah, 'Abd
	bin Humaid, Abu Ya'la and others through reliable channels. The only
	diversity is that in some traditions it is stated that the incident
	took place when the Prayer was in progress; in others that it
	happened when the Holy Prophet was delivering the Sermon. However,
	what appears to be correct when the tradition of Hadrat Jabir and
	those of others are read together is that it happened during the
	Sermon. Where Hadrat Jabir says that it happened during the Friday
	Prayer, he in fact has used the word Friday Prayer for the
	combination of the Sermon and the Prayer. According to the tradition
	of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas, seven women had remained behind with
	12 men. (Ibn Marduyah). Qatadah says that one woman remained with 12
	men, (lbn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim). According to the tradition of
	Daraqutni 40 individuals remmained, of `Abd bin Humaid 7 individuals
	and of Farra 8 individuals. But all these are weak traditions. The
	tradition of Qatadah that sack a thing happened thrice is also weak.
	(Ibn Jarir) The authentic tradition in this regard is of Hadrat
	Jabir, according to which the number of those who remained behind is
	stated to be 12. Apart from one tradition of Qatadah, all traditions
	of the other Companions and their followers agree that this happened
	only once. When read together different traditions about those who
	remained behind show that they included Hadrat Abu Bakr, Hadrat
	'Umar, Hadrat 'Uthman, Hadrat 'AIi, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud,
	Hadrat 'Ammar bin Yasir, Hadrat Salim (slave of Hudhaifah) and
	Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah. The tradition related by Hafiz Abu Ya`la
	from Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah says that when the people rushed out
	like that and only 12 Companions were left behind, the Holy Prophet
	addressed them, saying: &quot;By Him in Whose hand is my life, if
	all of you had left, and none had remained behind, this valley would
	have overflowed with fire. &quot; A theme resembling this has been
	cited by Ibn Marduyah from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas and by Ibn
	Jarir from Qatadah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Shiite scholars have used this incident also for taunting and
	finding fault with the Companions. They say that abandoning the
	Sermon and the Prayer by such a large number of the Companions for
	the sake of worldly gain and amusement is a proof that they
	preferred the world to the Hereafter. But this is a misplaced
	objection that can be raised only if one keeps ones eyes closed to
	realities. As a matter of fact, this incident took place just after
	the migration. At that time, on the one hand, the collective
	training of the Companions was in the initial stages, and on the
	other, the disbelievers of Makkah had subjected the people of
	Madinah to a strict economic blockade because of which necessities
	of lift had become scarce in the city. Hadrat Hasan Basri says that
	the people at time were starving and the prices had risen abnormally
	high. (Ibn Jarir). Under such conditions when a trade caravan
	arrived, the people rushed out to buy things of daily need lest
	these were sold out before the Prayer was concluded. This was a
	weakness and error which became suddenly manifest due to
	insufficient training and severity of the conditions. But whoever
	sees the sacrifices made by the Companions for the cause of Islam
	afterwards and sees what piety and righteousness they displayed in
	the matter of worship and dedication and dealings can never dare
	bring against them the allegation that they preferred the world to
	the Hereafter unless he himself bears malice against the Companions.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">However,
	just as this incident does not support the critics of the Canpanions
	of the Holy Prophet, so it also does not support the ideas of those
	people who cherish exaggerated notions about them and claim that
	they never committed any error, or if they committed some, it should
	not be mentioned, for making mention of their error and' calling it
	an error is derogatory and it reduces one's reverence and respect
	for them, and its mention goes against the verses of the Qur'an and
	the Hadith, which state that the Companions arc Allah's favorite
	people and have already been forgiven all their errors and mistakes.
	AlI this is exaggeration for which there is no basis in the Qur'an
	and he ,Hadith. Here, everyone can see for himself that Allah
	Himself has mentioned the error that happened to have been committed
	by a large number of the Companions, in the Book that will be read
	by the entire Ummah till Resurrection, and in the same Book which
	speaks of their having been forgiven and being chosen people of
	Allah. Then in the books of the Hadith and Commentary also details
	of this error have been described by all scholars, from the
	Companions to the major scholars among the followers of the Sunnah.
	Does it mean that Allah has made this mention in order to destroy
	the reverence for the same Companions whose reverence and esteem He
	wants to instill in all our hearts? And does it mean that the
	Companions and their followers and the traditionists and
	commentators have mentioned these details of this incident because
	they were unaware of the religious aspect of the matter which these
	zealots show and describe? And have the people who read Surah
	AI-Jumu 'ah and study its commentary really lost reverence and
	esteem for the Companions from their hearts? If the answer to each
	of these questions is in the negative, and it is surely in the
	negative, then all those exaggerated ideas and notions, which some
	people express and show in regard to the reverence of the Holy
	Prophet's Companions, arc erroneous. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The truth
	is that the Companions of the Holy Prophet were not supernormal
	beings: they were only human born in this very world. Whatever they
	attained, they attained through the persistent training imparted by
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) over many years. The
	method of this training as we learn from the Qur'an and the Hadith
	was; Whenever a weakness appeared in them, Allah and His Messenger
	turned immediate attention to it, and a program of education and
	training was established to overcome and eradicate it. In the matter
	of this very Friday Prayer we see that when the incident of the
	trade caravan occurred, Allah sent down this section of the verses
	of Surah AI-Jumu'ah to administer warning and teach the etiquette of
	the Friday Service. Along with this the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) impressed on the people the importance of the
	obligatory nature of the Service continuously in his Sermons as
	explained in E.N. 15 above. All these instructions are found in the
	Hadith in clear words. Hadrat Abu Sa'id Khudri says that the Holy
	Prophet said: &quot;Every Muslim must have full bath on Friday,
	should clean his teeth, put on the best available clothes, and use
	perfume if possible.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud,
	Nasa'i). Hadrat Salman Farsi says that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;The
	Muslim who has bath on Friday, cleans and purifies himself as far as
	possible, applies oil to his hair, or uses perfume if available, and
	comes to the mosque and takes his place without disturbing others,
	then offers the (voluntary) Prayer that Allah has destined for him,
	then listens quietly when the Imam speaks, he will have his sins and
	errors committed since the previous Friday forgiven. &quot;
	(Bukhari, Musnad Ahmad). Traditions containing almost the same theme
	have been reported by Hadrat Abu Ayub An'ati, Hadrat Abu Hurairah
	and Hadrat Nubaishat alHudhali also from the Holy Prophet. (Musnad
	Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi Tabarani). Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin 'Abbas says that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;The
	person who speaks when the Imam is delivering the sermon, is like
	the donkey loaded with books, and the person who tells him to keep
	quiet has also rendered his own Prayer void. &quot; (Musnad Ahmad
	Hadrat Abu Huraira'. says that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;If on
	Friday during the sermon you said to a person, 'keep quiet,' you too
	behaved wrong.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ud).
	Traditions closely resembling this have been related by Imam Ahmad
	Abu Da'ud and Tabarani from Hadrat `Ali and Hadrat Abu ad-Darda'. To
	the person delivering the sermon also the Holy Prophet instructed
	that he should not deliver a lengthy sermon to try the people's
	patience. His own practice on Friday was that he gave brief Sermons
	and Ied short Prayers. Hadrat Jabir bin Samurah says that the Holy
	Prophet would never give a lengthy Sermon: he was always very
	brief.&quot; (Abu Da'ud). Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Abi Aufa says: &quot;The
	Holy Prophet's sermon used to be shorter than the Prayer, and the
	Prayer a little longer than the sermon.&quot; (Nasa'i), According to
	Hadrat Ammar bin Yasir, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;The
	prolongation of the Prayer and the brevity of the sermon are a sign
	that the Imam has deep insight in religion&quot; (Musnad Ahmad,
	Muslim Almost the same theme has Bazzar related from Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin Mas'ud. All this shows how the Holy Prophet taught the
	people the etiquette of the Friday congregational Service till it
	began w be performed in the unique manner unknown in the
	congregational worship of any other people in the world.&nbsp;

	Allah's wrath and displeasure and reprimand would have been much

	was only due to insufficient training, Allah first taught the people
	the coquette of the Friday Service, then, after pointing out the
