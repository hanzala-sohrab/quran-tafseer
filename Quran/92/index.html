subject matter so closely resembles that of Surah Ash-Shams that each
Surah seems to be an explanation of the other. It is one and the same

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Its
theme is to distinguish between the two different ways of life and to
explain the contrast between their ultimate ends and results. In view
of the subject matter this Surah consists of two parts, the first
part consisting of vv. 1-11 and the second of vv. 12-21. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the first part, at the outset it has been pointed out that the
strivings and doings that the individuals, nations and groups of
mankind are engaged in in the world, are, in respect of their moral
nature, as divergent as the day is from the night, and the male from
the female. After this, according to the general style of the brief
Surahs of the Quran, three moral characteristics of one kind and
three moral characteristics of the other kind have been presented as
an illustration from among a vast collection of the strivings and
activities of man, from which every man can judge which style of life
is represented by one kind of the characteristics and which style of
life by the other kind. Both these styles have been described in such
brief, elegant. and pithy sentences that they move the heart and go
down into memory as soon as one hears them. Characteristics of the
first kind are that one should spend one's wealth, adopt
God-consciousness and piety, and acknowledge the good as good. The
second kind of the characteristics are that one should be miserly,
should least care for God's pleasure and His displeasure, and should
repudiate what is good and right. Then it has been stated that these
two modes of action which are clearly divergent, cannot be equal and
alike in respect of their results. But, just as they are divergent in
their nature, so they are divergent in their results. The person (or
group of persons) who adopts the first mode of action, Allah will
make easy for him the correct way of life, so much so that doing good
will become easy for him and doing evil difficult. On the contrary,
he who adopts the second mode of life, Allah will make easy for him
the difficult and hard way of life, so much so that doing evil will
become easy for him and doing good difficult. This passage has been
concluded with a most effective and touching sentence, saying: &quot;This
worldly wealth for the sake of which man is even prepared to risk his
life will not go down with him into the grave; therefore, what will
it avail him after death?&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the second part also three truths have been stated equally briefly.
First, that Allah has not left man uninformed in the examination hall
of the world, but He has taken on Himself the responsibility to tell
him which one is the straight and right way out of the different ways
of life. Here, there was no need to point out that by sending His
Messenger and His Book He has fulfilled His this responsibility, for
both the Messenger and the Book were present to afford the guidance.
Second, that the Master of both the world and the Hereafter is Allah
alone. If you seek the world, it is He Who will give it, and if you
seek the Hereafter, again it is He Who will give it. Now, it is for
you to decide what you should seek from Him. The third truth that has
been stated is that the wretched one who rejects the good, which is
being presented through the Messenger and the Book, and turns away
from it, will have a blazing fire ready for him. As for the God
fearing person who spends his wealth in a good cause, without any
selfish motive, only for the sake of winning his Lord's good
pleasure, his Lord will be pleased with him and will bless him with
so much that he will be well pleased with Him. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>This
	is that for which an oath has been sworn by the night and the day,
	and the creation of the male and the female. It means to say: Just
	as the night and the day, and the male and the female, are different
	from each other, and their effects and results are mutually
	contradictory, so are the aims and objects for which men are
	endeavoring and struggling, different in their nature and
	contradictory with regard to their results. In the following verses,
	it has been told that all these divided endeavors are divided into
	two main kinds.&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote2">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>This
	is the first kind of endeavors, which includes three things, and a
	little consideration shows that they comprehend all virtues: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	Man should refrain from wealth-worship, but should spend whatever
	Allah has given him generously in rendering Allah's and His
	servants' rights, for good works and for helping others; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	he should fear God and refrain from things which cause His
	displeasure in his moral, social, economic and other dealings with
	the people; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) that
	he should believe in goodness. Goodness is a comprehensive word,
	which includes goodness of belief, morals and acts. Goodness of
	belief means that one should give up polytheism; atheism, and
	disbelief, and affirm faith in Tauhid, the Hereafter, and
	Prophethood. Affirming belief in goodness of morals and acts is that
	one should not be doing good and right merely unconsciously, outside
	a definite system, but one should acknowledge as right and sound the
	system of goodness which God has sent, which combines every kind of
	goodness in all its forms and aspects into a system comprehensively
	called the Divine Shari'ah.&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>This
	is the result of the first kind of endeavoring and struggling. The
	easy way implies the way which is in accordance with human nature,
	which is in accordance with the will of the Creator, Who has created
	man and the whole _ universe. It is a way in which man has not to
	fight his conscience, in which he does not have to force his
	faculties of mind and energies of body into doing works for which
	they are not given but to do things for which they have actually
	been given him. It is a way in which man has not to experience war,
	resistance and conflict on every side, which he has to experience in
	a life full of sin, but a human society in which at every step he
	experiences peace and concord, appreciation and honor. Obviously,
	the person who spends his wealth for public welfare, treats every
	other person kindly and well, whose life is free from crime, sin and
	immorality, who is righteous and fair in his dealings, who neither
	cheats others nor proves false in his promises, from whom no one
	apprehends dishonesty, injustice and excess, and with whose
	character no one finds any fault, will in any case be honored and
	respected in any society, however, corrupt and depraved it may be.
	Hearts will be attracted towards him in esteem and regard; his own
	heart and conscience will be satisfied, and he will attain to
	dignity in society which no immoral person can ever attain. This
	same thing has been expressed in Surah AnNahl, thus: &quot;Whoever
	does righteous deeds whether male or female, provided that he is a
	believer, We will surely grant him to live a pure life in this world
	(v. 97)&quot;, and in Surah Maryam, thus &quot;The Merciful ,will
	fill with love the hearts of those who believe and do righteous
	deeds (v. 86). This then is the way in which there is nothing but
	joy and tranquility for man, for the world till the Hereafter. Its
	results are not transient and temporary but eternal and everlasting.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Concerning
	this Allah says &quot;We shall facilitate for him the easy way.&quot;
	It means to say &quot;When after affirming goodness he decides that
	this way alone suits him, and the evil way does not suit him, and
	when by making sacrifices and adopting the life of -taqwa
	practically he proves that he is true in his affirmation, Allah will
	make easy for him to walk this way. Then, to commit evil will become
	difficult for him, and to do good easy. When unlawful wealth comes
	before him, he will not regard it as a good bargain, but consider it
	a hot piece of burning coal, which he cannot hold in his hand. When
	opportunities for sin appear before him, he will not rush to seize
	them as opportunities for pleasure and enjoyment, but will look upon
	them as gates to Hell and will flee them. The Prayer will not be
	hard for him, and hem will have no internal peace until he has
	performed it at its appointed time. He will not feel hurt when
	paying the zakat, but will regard his wealth as impure until he has
	paid out the Zakat from it. In short, at every step, Allah will
	favor him with His grace and help him to follow this way; conditions
	will be made favorable for him and he will be helped out of every
	difficulty.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now, the
	question arises that in Surah Al-Baled above this very way has been
	called an uphill road, and hire it has been described as an easy way
	How can the two things be reconciled? The answer is that before a
	man has adopted this way, it appears to be a steep, uphill road, for
	ascending which he has to fight his desires, his materialistic
	members of the family, his relatives, his friends and those with
	whom he has social and other dealings, and above all Satan, for each
	one of them obstructs his way, and makes it seem dreadful. But after
	man has affirmed goodness and resolved to follow this way, and
	giving away his wealth in the cause of God and adopting the way of
	taqwa, has practically strengthened his resolve, ascending the steep
	road becomes easy and slipping into the abyss of moral depravities
	becomes difficult for him.&nbsp;

</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote4">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>This
	is the second kind of human endeavoring, which in every part of it
	is different from the corresponding part of the first kind.
	Niggardliness (bukhl) is not merely the niggardliness because of
	which people generally regard a person as niggardly if he hoards
	money: neither spends it on himself nor on his children, but bukhl
	here implies to refrain from spending in the cause of Allah and
	public welfare. According to this, niggardly is every person who
	spends generously, rather squanders money, on his self, for his own
	ease and comfort, interests and enjoyments, but, as. for a good
	cause, spends nothing, or, if at all he spends anything, ii is for
	display, or to win a reputation and name, or to have access to
	officers, or to obtain some benefit and gain. Independence of God
	implies that one should make worldly, material benefits only the
	object of all one's endeavors and strivings and being independent of
	God should least care to see what pleases Him and what displeases
	Him. As for belying goodness, it is in sharp contrast to believing
	in goodness in every detail, therefore, it need not be explained
	here as it has already been explained above.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>This
	way has been called the hard way, for although the one who follows
	it, does so for the sake of material benefits, worldly enjoyments
	and superficial successes, yet while following it he is always at
	war with his nature his conscience, the laws made by the Creator of
	the universe and the society in Which he lives. When he transgresses
	all moral limits of truth, honesty, nobility, purity and chastity
	and endeavors to satisfy his interests and desires in every way,
	when the people feel harmed by him rather than benefiting from him,
	and when he encroaches upon the rights of others and violates
	people's honor, he feels disgraced in his own eyes and has to clash
	at every step with the society in which he lives. If he is weak, he
	has to suffer every kind of punishment on account of his conduct,
	and if he is wealthy, strong and influential, the world may lie low
	before him, but no one cherishes any good wishes, any feeling of
	honor and love for him; so much so that even his associates and
	companions regard him as a wicked man. And this thing is not only
	restricted to individuals, even when a strong and powerful nation
	transgresses the bounds of morality and adopts an immoral conduct,
	in arrogance of pride and wealth, it earns on the one hand, the
	enmity of the outside world: on the other, its own society falls a
	victim to all sorts of crime, prevalence of suicide, intoxication,
	venereal diseases, destruction of family life, waywardness of the
	new generation, class conflict and ever-increasing injustice and
	tyranny. So much so that when it falls from its position of
	prestige, it leaves nothing behind except curses and condemnation
	for itself in the history of the world.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	saying that &quot;We shall facilitate for him the hard ways&quot;,
	it means: He will be deprived of the grace to follow the way of
	good, gates of evil will be opened up for him, means and resources
	for the same will be provided for him, doing evil will become easy,
	and doing good will become toilsome and risky for him. This same
	theme has been expressed at another place in the Qur'an, thus: &quot;So
	whomever Allah wills to guide aright, He makes his breast wide open
	to Islam, and whomever He wills to let go astray, he makes his
	breast narrow and squeezes it so tightly that ( at the very idea of
	Islam) he begins to feel as though his soul were climbing up towards
	the sky.&quot; (Al-An`am :125) . At another place it has been said:
	&quot;No doubt, salat is a hard task but not for the obedient
	servants.&quot; (Al Baqarah: 46). And about the hypocrites it has
	been said: &quot;When they come to offer the salat, they come
	reluctantly and they expend in the way of Allah with unwilling
	hearts.&quot; (At-Taubah: 54), and that: &quot;There are such among
	them, who regard what they expend in the way of Allah as a penalty.&quot;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This very

	away from obedience; the other one is the person, who not only
	believes but also spends his wealth in the cause of Allah sincerely,
	without any desire for display and reputation, only in order to be
	regarded as a pure man in His eyes. Both these types of character
	were present in the Makkah society of that day. Therefore., without

	is further explanation of the sincerity of the pious man. He was not
	indebted in any way to the people on whom he spends his wealth so
	that he may be doing so in order to repay for favors received, or
	may be giving gifts and holding banquets to them in order to further
	benefit from them, but he is helping such people only in order to
	seek the goodwill of his Lord, the Supreme. He was neither indebted
	to them before, nor he expects any favors from them in the future.
	Its best illustration is the act of Hadrat Abu Bakr Siddiq (may
	Allah blesshim), He would purchase and set free the poor slaves and
	slaves-girls who accepted Islam in Makkah and were cruelly treated
	by their masters on that account. Ibn Jarir and Ibn 'Asakir have
	related, on the authority of Hadrat 'Amir bin 'Abdullah bin Zubair,
	that when Hadrat Abu Bakr's father saw him spending money to
	purchase the freedom of the poor slaves and slave-girls, he said to
	him: &quot;Son, I see that you are getting the weak people free; had
	you spent this money on the freedom of strong, young men, they would
	have become your helpers and supporters.&quot; Hadrat Abu Bakr
