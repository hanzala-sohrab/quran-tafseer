the Surah is read with this background in mind, one finds that it was
not revealed to preach religious tolerance as some people of today
seem to think, but it was revealed in order to exonerate the Muslims
from the disbelievers religion, their rites of worship, and their
gods, and to express their total disgust and unconcern with them and
to tell them that Islam and kufr (unbelief) had nothing in common and
there was no possibility of their being combined and mixed into one
entity. Although it was addressed in the beginning to the
disbelieving Quraish in response to their proposals of compromise,
yet it is not confined to them only, but having made it a part of the
Quran, Allah gave the Muslims the eternal teaching that they should
exonerate themselves by word and deed from the creed of kufr wherever
and in whatever form it be, and should declare without any
reservation that they cannot make any compromise with the
disbelievers in the matter of Faith. That is why this Surah continued
to be recited when the people to whom it was addressed as a
rejoinder, had died and been forgotten, and those Muslims also
continued to recite it who were disbelievers at the time it was
revealed, and the Muslims still recite it centuries after they have
passed away, for expression of disgust with and dissociation from

	few points in this verse are particularly noteworthy: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)Although
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has been commanded to tell
	this to the disbelievers plainly, the theme that follows makes it
	explicit that every believer should tell the disbelievers plainly
	what has been said in the following verses; so much so that the
	person who has just believed and repented of kufr is also bound to
	express similarly his disgust with and disapproval of the creed and
	rites of worship and gods of kufr. Thus, though the first addressee
	of the word qul (say) is the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	himself, the command is not restricted to him alone but it reaches
	every believer through him. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)The
	word &quot;kafir' is no abuse, which might have been used for the
	addressees of this verse, but it implies the one who refuses to
	believe, or is an unbeliever. As against it the word &quot;mu min&quot;
	is used for the believer. Therefore, the Holy Prophet's saying, by
	Allah's command, &quot;O disbelievers, ... ', in fact, means: &quot;O
	you, who have refused to believe in my apostleship and in the
	teachings brought by me.&quot; Likewise. when a believer uses this
	word, it will imply those who do not believe in the Holy Prophet
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings), 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	word used is &quot;O kafirs&quot; and not &quot;O mushriks&quot;;
	therefore, the addressees are not only the mushriks but all those
	people who do not acknowledge Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace
	and blessings) as Allah's Messenger and the teachings and guidance
	brought by him as the teaching and guidance given by Allah Himself,
	whether they be Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians or the disbelievers,
	polytheists and pagans of the entire world. There is no reason why
	this address be restricted to the pagans of Quraish or of Arabia
	only.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) To
	address the deniers with the word &quot;O kafirs&quot; is just like
	addressing certain people as &quot;O enemies&quot;, or &quot;O
	opponents&quot;. Such an address is not, in fact, directed to the
	person of the addressee but it is made on the basis of their
	characteristic of enmity and opposition, and lasts only until they
	are so characterized. If one of them gives up enmity and opposition,
	or turns a friend and supporter, he no longer remains the addressee
	of this word. Likewise, the address of &quot;O kafirs&quot; to the
	people also is in view of their characteristic of kufr and not their
	person. This address would be perpetual for him who continues to be
	a kafir till death, but the one who believes will no longer be its
	addressee.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) Many
	scholars from among the commentators have expressed the opinion that
	in this Surah the address of &quot;O disbelievers&quot; applied only
	to a few persons of Quraish, who were visiting the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) with proposals of compromise regarding religion
	and about whom Allah had informed His Messenger than they would not
	believe. They have formed this opinion for two reasons. First, that
	it is followed by La a `budu ma to `budun: &quot;I do not worship
	him or those whom you worship&quot; . They say that this does not
	apply to the Jews and Christians, for they worship Allah. Second,
	that this is also followed by: wa la antum `abiduna ma a`bud &quot;Nor
	are you worshipers of Him Whom I worship&quot;. Their reasoning is
	that this statement does not apply to the people who at the
	revelation of this Surah were disbelievers but later believed. Both
	these arguments are incorrect. As for these verses, their
	explanation that follows will show that they do not bear the meaning
	which has been understood from them. Here, to point out the error of
	the reasoning it would be enough to say that if the addressees of
	this Surah were only these people, why then does this Surah still
	continue to be recited when they are dead and gone from the world
	long long ago? And what was the need of making this Surah a part of
	the Qur'an permanently so that the Muslims should continue to read
	it for ever afterwards?</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>This
	includes all those deities whom the disbelievers and the polytheists
	have been, and are still, worshiping everywhere in the world,
	whether they are the angels, the jinn, prophets, saints, spirits of
	the living or dead men, or the sun, the moon, stars, animals, trees,
	rivers, idols and imaginary gods and goddesses. One may say that the
	pagans of Arabia acknowledged Allah also as a Deity and the other
	pagans of the world also have never disacknowledged Allah as a Deity
	till today. As for the followers of the earlier scriptures, they
	also acknowledge Allah alone as the real Deity. How then can it be
	correct to exonerate oneself froth the worship of all the deities of
	all those people, without' exception, when Allah too is included
	among them? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	answer is that if Allah is worshiped along with others regarding Him
	as a Deity among other deities, the believer in Tauhid will
	inevitably express his immunity from this worship, for in his sight
	Allah is oat a Deity out of a collection of deities, but He alone is
	the real Deity, and the worship of the collection of deities is no
	worship of Allah, although worship of Allah also is included in it.
	The Qur'an has clearly stated that Allah's worship is only that
	which does not have any tinge of the worship of another and in which
	man makes his worship exclusively Allah's. &quot;And the only
	Command they were given, was to worship Allah, making their religion
	sincerely His, turning all their attention towards Him.&quot;
	(Al-Bayyinah: 5). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	subject has been explained at many places in the Qur'an forcefully;
	for example, see Au-Nisa': 145-146, AI-A`raf :29, AzZumar: 2, 3, 11,
	14, 15, A1-Mu'min: 14, 64-66. It has been further explained in a
	Hadith Qudsi (i.e. Divine Word revealed through the mouth of the
	Prophet) in which the messenger of Allah says: &quot;Allah says: I
	am Self-Sufficient of the association of every associate most of
	all. Whoever performed an act in which he associated another also
	with Me, 1 am free of it, and the entire act is for him who was
	associated.&quot; (Muslim, Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Majah). Thus,
	acknowledging Allah as one of the two, three or many gods and
	serving and worshiping others along with Him is, in fact, the real
	kufr, declaration of immunity from which is the object of this
	Surah.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>The
	words used are: ma a'budu. The word ma in Arabic, is generally used
	for lifeless or unintelligent things, and the word man for
	intelligent and rational beings. The question arises why has ma a
	`budu been used here instead of man a `budu? The commentators
	generally give four answers to it: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) that
	ma here is in the meaning of man; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	ma here is in the meaning of alladhi (i.e. which or who); 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) that
	in both the sentences ma is in the meaning of a noun of action
	(masdar) and it means: &quot;I do not perform the kind of worship
	that you perform, i. e. polytheistic worship, and you do not perform
	the kind of worship that I perform, i.e. worship of One God;&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) that
	since in the first sentence ma ta'buduna has been used, in the
	second ma a `budu has been used to keep the style; in both places
	there is only the uniformity of the word, there is no uniformity of
	meaning; instances of this are found elsewhere also in the Qur'an.
	For example, in AI-Baqarah: 194, it has been said: &quot;Therefore,
	if anyone transgresses a prohibition by attacking you, you may do
	likewise.&quot; Obviously, to transgress likewise in retaliation is
	no transgression, but the word transgression (in retaliation) Gas
	been used only for the sake of uniformity in style. In Surah
	At-Taubah: 67, it has been said: &quot;They forgot Allah, so Allah
	forgot them&quot;, whereas Allah does not forget. what meant to be
	said is that Allah ignored them. The word nisyan in respect of Allah
	has been used corresponding to their nisyaa (forgetfulness) only to
	keep the uniformity of the study. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Although
	all these four interpretations are correct in their own way, and
	there is room in Arabic to take all these meanings, yet none of
	these explains the real object for which ma a'budu has been used
	instead of man a `budu. As a matter of fact, when man is used for a
	person in Arabic, it is meant to say or ask something about his
	person, and when ma is used, it is meant to ask or express something
	about his characteristics and traits. This can be explained in
	English by the questions: who is he? and what is he? about a person.
	When it is asked, who is he? the object is to know something about
	his person. But when it is asked, what is he? the object is to know
	whether, for example, he belongs to the army, and if so, what is his
	rank, or whether he belongs to some teaching organization, and if
	so, whether he is a lecturer in it, or a reader, or a professor,
	what science or art subject he teaches, what are his qualifications,
	etc. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus, if
	in this verse, it was said: La antum abiduna man a `bud, it would
	mean: &quot;You are not worshipers of the being whom I worship, and
	in response, the disbelievers and the polytheists could have said
	that they too believed in the Being of Allah and also worshiped Him.
	But when it was said: La antum 'abiduna ma a`bud, it meant: &quot;You
	are not worshipers of the Deity who has the attributes of the Deity
	whom I worship.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And this
	is the real point on the basis of which the religion of the Prophet
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) is absolutely
	distinguish-ed from the religions of all kinds of disbelievers,
	besides the deniers of God, for his God is utterly different from
	the God of all of them. The God of some of them is such that He
	stood in need of rest on the seventh day after having created the
	world in six days, Who is not God of the universe but God of Israel,
	Who stands in a special relationship to the people of one particular
	race, which is not shared by other men, Who wrestles with the
	Prophet Jacob and cannot throw him, Who has also a son, named Ezra.
	The God of some others is father of an only son, called Jesus
	Christ, and He causes His son to be crucified in order to make him
	an atonement for the sins of others. The God of some has wife and
	children, but begets only daughters. The God of some assumes human
	form and shape and living in a human body on the earth works like
	men. The God of some is merely an Essence, or Cause of causes, or
	the First Cause, Who after giving the system of the universe the
	initial push is sitting aside unconcerned, the universe is working
	by itself according to some relentless laws, and now He and man have
	nothing to do with each other. In short, even the unbelievers who
	acknowledge God do not, in fact, acknowledge the God, Who is the
	Creator, . Master, Disposer, Administrator and Ruler of the entire
	universe, Who has not only set the system of the universe but is
	running and controlling it by Himself every moment, Who is above
	every defect, fault, weakness and error, Who is free from every
	similitude, every physical limitation, every likeness, Who is
	Self-Sufficient of every companion and associate, Who has no partner
	in His Being, attributes, powers and entitlement to worship, Who is
	far too Holy that He should have children, or should take some one
	for a son, or should have an exclusive relationship with a community
	or race, Who is directly related to each individual creature of His
	as His Providence, Sustainer and Guardian, Who hears the prayers and
	answers them, Who alone possesses all the powers to give life and
	death, to cause profit and loss, and to make and mar destinies, Who
	not only sustains His creatures but also guides each according to
	its nature and need, Who is not only our God Whom we worship but
	also enjoins commands and prohibitions through His Prophets and His
	Books, which we have to obey, before Whom we are accountable for our
	deeds, Who will resurrect us after death, call us to account and
	reward and punish us accordingly. No one in the world except for
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) and his
	followers, is worshiping the God with these attributes. If at all
	some others also are worshiping God, they are not worshiping the
	real and true God but the God who is their self-invented, imaginary
	God.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>A
	section of the commentators is of the view that both these sentences
	are a repetition of the theme of the first two sentences and the
	repetition is meant to strengthen the statement in the first two
	sentences. But many commentators do not regard it as a repetition.
	They say that a new theme has been expressed in these which is
	different from the theme of the first two sentences. In our opinion
	they arc correct in so far as there is no repetition in these
	sentences, for in these only &quot;nor are you worshipers of Him
	Whom I worship&quot; Gas been repeated, and this repetition also is
	not in the sense in which this sentence was used first. But after
	negating the repetition the meanings that this section of the
	commentators has given of these two sentences are very different
	from each other. There is no occasion here to take up and discuss
	each of the meanings given by the commentators. Avoiding details we
	shall only discuss the meaning which is correct in our opinion. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	first sentence, it has been said: &quot;Nor am I a worshiper of
	those whom you have worshiped.&quot; Its theme is absolutely
	different from the theme of verse 2, in which it was said: &quot;I
	do not worship those whom you warship,&quot; These two things widely
	differ in two aspects. First, that although there is denial, and a
	forceful denial, in saying that &quot;I do not, or shall not, do
	such and such a thing&quot;, yet there is much greater force in
	saying that &quot;1 am not a doer of such and such a thing&quot;,
	for it means: &quot;It is such an evil thing that nothing to say of
	committing it; it is not possible that I would even think of it, or
	have intention of doing it.&quot; Second, that the sentence &quot;whom
	you worship&quot; applies to only those gods whom the disbelievers
	are worshiping now. On the contrary, the sentence &quot;whom you
	have worshiped&quot; applies to all those gods whom the disbelievers
	and their forefathers have been worshiping in the past. Now, it is a
	well known fact that the gods of the polytheists and disbelievers
	have always been changing and their number increasing and
	decreasing. In different ages different groups of them have been
	worshiping different gods and the gods of all the disbelievers have
	never always been the same everywhere. Therefore, the verse means:
	&quot;I exonerate myself not only from your gods of today but also
	from the gods of your forefathers, and I am not a person who would
	even think of worshiping such gods.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the second sentence, although its words in verse 5 are the same as
	in verse 3, yet its meaning at the two places is different. In verse
	3, it follows this sentence: &quot;I do not worship those whom you
	worship.&quot; Therefore, it means: &quot;Nor are you worshipers of
	the God having the attributes of the One God Whom I worship.&quot;
	And in verse 5, it follows this sentence: &quot;Nor am I a worshiper
	of those whom you have worshiped.&quot; Therefore, it means: &quot;Nor
	does it seem you would become worshipers of the One God Whom I
	worship.&quot; Or, in other words, &quot;It is not possible that I
	should become a worshiper of each of those gods whom you and your
	forefathers have worshiped, and on account of your aversion to
	adopting worship of One God, instead of many gads, it cannot be
	expected that you would desist from this wrong worship and will
	become worshiper of Him Whom I worship.&quot;&nbsp;

	worshipers of my God. I cannot worship your gods and you are not
	prepared to worship my God, Therefore, you and I can never follow
	and walk one and the same path together.&quot; This is not a message
	of tolerance to the disbelievers, but a declaration of immunity,
	disgust with and dissociation from them as long as they are
	disbelievers. Its object is to disappoint them absolutely and
	finally that in the matter of religion the party of Allah's
	Messenger and his followers would ever come to terms with them. This

	in the Makki Surahs revealed after this Surah successively.

	whom you worship beside Allah, but I worship that Allah alone, Who
	has the power to cause your death.&quot; (v. 104).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In Surah

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These

	for the doubt that the verse Lakum dims kum wa liya din dces not
	mean: &quot;You may go on following your religion and allow me to
	follow mine&quot;, but it is the kind of declaration made in Surah
	Az-Zumar: 14: &quot;O Prophet, say to them: I shall serve Allah
	alone, making my religion sincerely His. As for you, you may serve
	whomever you please beside Him.&quot; (v. 14). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From this
	verse lmam Abu Hanifah and Imam Shafe`i have deduced that kufr
	(unbelief ), as a whole, is one community, however discordant and
	different from each other be the religions of the unbelievers;
	therefore, a Jew can inherit a Christian, and a Christian a Jew, and
	likewise the unbeliever of one religion can inherit the un-believer
	of another religion, if there exists between them a relationship by
	descent or marriage, or some other connection, which necessitates
	the passage of inheritance of one to another. On the contrary, Imam
	Malik, Imam Auza`i and Imam Ahmad hold the view that the followers
	of one religion cannot inherit the followers of another religion.
	They deduce this from the Hadith which has been related on the
	authority of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin al-As, saying that
	Allah's Messenger (upon whom be peace) said: &quot;The people of two
	different communities cannot inherit each other.&quot; (Musnad
	Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Ibn Majah, Daraqutni). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A Hadith
	with almost the same content has been related by Tirmidhi from
	Hadrat Jabir, by Ibn Hibban from Hadrat `Ahdullah bin `Umar, and by
	Bazzar from Hadrat Abu Hurairah. Dealing with this legal problem
	comprehensively, the well known Hanafi Imam; Shamsul-A'immah
	Sarakhsi, writes: &quot;The unbelievers can inherit each other
	mutually for all those reasons for which the Muslims inherit each
	other mutually, and they can also inherit each other in certain
	other cases in which the Muslims do not inherit each other ... The
	fact is that Allah recognizes only two ways of life, the religion of
	Truth and the religion of falsehood; that is why He has declared:
	Lakum dine-kum wa liya din. And He has classified the people also
	into two groups, one group will go to Paradise and this consists of
	the believers, and the second group will go to Hell and this
	consists of the disbelievers collectively. And He has declared the
	two groups only as the potential opponents of each other: &quot;These
	are the two parties who have disputed about their Lord.&quot;
	(AI-Hajj: 19). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">That is,
	one group comprises all the disbelievers collectively and they are
	opposed to the believers ... We do not admit that they are separate
	and distinct communities according to their beliefs, but as against
	the Muslims they all form one community. For the Muslims affirm
	faith in the prephethood of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
	blessings) and in the Qur'an and they refuse to affirm faith. For
	this very reason they have been declared to be unbelievers and are
	one community as opposed to the Muslims ... The Hadith, La
	yata-warith ahl millatain, points to the same thing as explained
	above. For the Holy Prophet has explained the word millatain (two
	communities) by his saying: La yarithul Muslim al-kafir wa lal-kafir
	al-Maslim: &quot;The Muslim cannot inherit the disbeliever, nor the
	disbeliever can inherit the Muslim.&quot; (AIMabsut vol. 30, pp.
	30-32). The Hadith cited here by Imam Sarakhsi has been related by
	Bukhari, Muslim, Nasa'i, Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and Abu Da'ud on
	the authority of Hadrat Usamah bin Zaid.
