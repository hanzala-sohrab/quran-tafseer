Hasan Basri, 'Ikrimah, 'Ata' and Jabir bin Zaid say that these Surahs
are Makki. A tradition from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also supports
the same view. However, according to another tradition from him, it
is Madani and the same view is held also by Hadrat 'Abdullah bin

Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal have related on the authority of Hadrat 'Uqbah

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">is used as an argument for these
Surahs to be Madani because Hadrat 'Uqbah bin 'Amir had become a
Muslim in Madinah after the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">hijrah</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
as related by Abu Da'ud and Nasa'i on the basis of his own statement.
Other traditions which have lent strength to this view are those
related by Ibn Sa'd, Muhiyy-us-Sunnah Baghawi, Imam Nasafi, Imam
Baihaqi, Hafiz Ibn Hajar, Hafiz Badr-uddin 'Ayni, 'Abd bin Humaid and
others to the effect that these Surahs were revealed when the Jews
had worked magic on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) in Madinah
and he had fallen ill under its effect. Ibn Sa'd has related on the
authority of Waqidi that this happened in A.H. 7. On this very basis
Sufyan bin Uyainah also has described these Surah as Madani. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">But
as we have explained in the Introduction to Surah Al-Ikhlas, when it
is said about a certain Surah or verse that it was revealed on this
or that particular occasion, it does not necessarily mean that it was
revealed for the first time on that very occasion. Rather it
sometimes so happened that a Surah or a verse had previously been
revealed, then on the occurrence or appearance of a particular
incident or situation, the Holy Prophet's attention was drawn to it
by Allah for the second time, or even again and again. In our opinion
the same also was the case with the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mu'awwidhatayn</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
The subject matter of these Surahs is explicit that these were sent
down at Makkah in the first instance when opposition to the Holy
Prophet there had grown very intense. Later, when at Madinah storms
of opposition were raised by the hypocrites, Jews and polytheists,
the Holy Prophet was instructed to recite these very Surahs, as has
been mentioned in the above cited tradition from Hadrat Uqbah bin
Amir. After this, when magic was worked on him, and his illness grew
intense, Gabriel came and instructed him by Allah's command to recite
these very Surahs. Therefore, in our opinion, the view held by the
commentators who describe both these Surahs as Makki is more
reliable. Regarding them as connected exclusively with the incident
of magic is difficult, for to this incident related only one verse
(v.4), the remaining verses of Surah al Falaq and the whole of Surah
An-Nas have nothing to do with it directly. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<H2 STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Theme
and Subject-Matter</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
conditions under which these two Surahs were sent down in Makkah were
as follows. As soon as the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) began to
preach the message of Islam, it seemed as though he had provoked all
classes of the people around him. As his message spread the
opposition of the disbelieving Quraish also became more and more
intense. As long as they had any hope that they would be able to
prevent him from preaching his message by throwing some temptation in
his way, or striking some bargain with him, their hostility did not
become very active. But when the Holy Prophet disappointed them
completely that he would not effect any kind of compromise with them
in the matter of faith, and in Surah Al-Kafirun they were plainly
told: &quot;I do not worship those who you worship nor are you
worshipers of Him Whom I worship. For you is your religion and for me
is mine&quot;, the hostility touched its extreme limits. More
particularly, the families whose members (men or women, boys or
girls) had accepted Islam, were burning with rage from within against
the Holy Prophet. They were cursing him, holding secret consultations
to kill him quietly in the dark of the night so that the Bani Hashim
could not discover the murderer and take revenge; magic and charms
were being worked on him so as to cause his death, or make him fall
ill, or become mad; satans from among the men and the jinn spread on
every side so as to whisper one or another evil into the hearts of
the people against him and the Qur'an brought by him so that they
became suspicious of him and fled him. There were many people who
were burning with jealousy against him, for they could not tolerate
that a man from another family or clan than their own should flourish
and become prominent. For instance, the reason why Abu Jahl was
crossing every limit in his hostility to him has been explained by
himself: &quot;We and the Bani Abdi Manaf (to which the Holy Prophet
belonged) were rivals of each other: they fed others, we too fed
others; they provided conveyances to the people, we too did the same;
they gave donations, we too gave donations, so much so that when they
and we have become equal in honor and nobility, they now proclaim
that they have a Prophet who is inspired from the heaven; how can we
compete with them in this field? By God, we will never acknowledge
him, nor affirm faith in him&quot;. (</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ibn
Hisham</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Such
were the conditions when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was
commanded to tell the people: &quot;I seek refuge with the Lord of
the dawn, from the evil of everything that He has created, and from
the evil of the darkness of night and from the evil of magicians, men
and women, and from the evil of the envious&quot;, and to tell them:
&quot;I seek refuge with the Lord of mankind, the King of mankind,
and the Deity of mankind, from the evil of the whisperer, who returns
over and over again, who whispers (evil) into the hearts of men,
whether he be from among the jinn or men.&quot; This is similar to
what the Prophet Moses had been told to say when Pharaoh had
expressed his design before his full court to kill him: &quot;I have
taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord against every arrogant person
who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning.&quot; (Al-Mu'min: 27).
And: &quot;I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord lest you
should assail me.&quot; (Ad-Dukhan;20). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On
both occasions these illustrious Prophets of Allah were confronted
with well-equipped, resourceful and powerful enemies. On both
occasions they stood firm on their message of Truth against their
strong opponents, whereas they had no material power on the strength
of which they could fight them, and on both occasions they utterly
disregarded the threats and dangerous plans and hostile devices of
the enemy, saying: &quot;We have taken refuge with the Lord of the
universe against you.&quot; Obviously, such firmness and
steadfastness can be shown only by the person who has the conviction
that the power of His Lord is the supreme power, that all powers of
the world are insignificant against Him, and that no one can harm the
one who has taken His refuge. Only such a one can say: &quot;I will
not give up preaching the Word of Truth. I care the least for what
you may say or do, for I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord
and Lord of all universe.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">and commentary concerning these Surahs
have been discussed, which are likely to create doubts in the minds,
it is necessary to clear them also here. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">First,
whether it is absolutely established that these two Surahs are the
Qur'anic Surahs, or whether there is some doubt in this regard. This
question arose because in the traditions related from an illustrious
Companion like Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, it has been said that he
did not regard these two Surahs as the Surahs of the Qur'an and had
eliminated these from his copy of the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mushaf</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
Imam Ahmad, Bazzar, Tabarani, Ibn Marduyah, Abu Ya'la, Abdullah bin
Ahmad bin Hanbal, Humaydi, Abu Nu'aim, Ibn Hibban and other
traditionists have related this from Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud with
different chains of transmitters and mostly on sound authority.
According to these traditions, he not only eliminated these Surahs
from the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mushaf</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">but it has also been reported that he
used to say: &quot;Do not mix up with the Qur'an that which is not of
the Qur'an. These two Surahs are not included in the Quran. This was
only a command enjoined on the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) for
seeking God's refuge.&quot; In some traditions there is also the
addition that he did not recite these Surahs in the Prayer. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">On
the basis of these traditions the opponents of Islam had an
opportunity to raise doubts about the Qur'an, saying that this Book,
God forbid, is not free from corruption. For when, according to a
Companion of the rank of Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud, these two Surahs
are an annexation to the Qur'an, many other additions and
subtractions also might have been made in it. To rid the Qur'an of
this blame Qadi Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani, Qadi Iyad and others took the
stand that Ibn Mas'ud was not in fact a denier of the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mu'awwidhatayn</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

write them in the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mushaf</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
For, according to him, only that which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) had allowed, should be written in the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mushaf</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
and Ibn Mas'ud did not receive the information that the Holy Prophet
had allowed this. But this stand is not correct, for according to
sound evidence, it is confirmed that Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased
with him) had denied that these were Surahs of the Qur'an. Some other
scholars, for instance, Imam Nawawi, Imam Ibn Hazm and Imam
Fakhr-ud-din Razi, regard this as a pure lie and falsehood that Ibn
Mas'ud had asserted any such thing. But to reject genuine historical
facts without sound evidence is unscientific. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

Hubaish, with a slight variation in wording from Hadrat Ubayy bin

of his knowledge of the Qur'an. Zirr bin Hubaish states: &quot;I said
to Hadrat Ubayy: Your brother, Abdullah bin Mas'ud, says these

But he did not feel any need to question the Holy Prophet about it.
In the mind of Hadrat Ubbay bin Kab also a question arose about his
and he put it before the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet replied:
&quot;Since Gabriel (peace be on him) had said </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">qul</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,

Let us put it like this. If somebody is commanded and asked: &quot;Say,
I seek refuge&quot;, he will not carry out the command, saying: &quot;Say,
I seek refuge&quot;, but he will drop the work &quot;say&quot; and
say: &quot;I seek refuge.&quot; On the contrary, if the messenger of
a superior officer conveys to somebody the message in these words:
&quot;Say, I seek refuge&quot;, and this command is given to him not
only for his own person but to be conveyed to others, he will convey
the words of the message verbatim to the people, and will not have
the permission to drop anything from the text of the message. Thus,
the fact that these two Surahs begin with the word </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">qul</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">is a clear proof that it is Divine
Word, which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was bound to convey
verbatim. It was not merely a command given to him for his person.
Besides these two Surahs, there are 330 other verses in the Qur'an
which begin with the word </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">qul</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

what he was commanded to say. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

if one considers this, one can understand fully well how unreasonable
it is to regard the Companions as infallible and to make the clamor
that a Companion has been defamed as soon as one hears a saying or
doing of his being described as wrong. Here, one can clearly see what
a blunder happened to be committed by an illustrious Companion like
Hadrat Abdullah bin Mas'ud about two Surahs of the Qur'an. If such an
error could be committed by an eminent Companion like him, others
also might commit an error. We can examine it in the scientific way,
and describe it as wrong if a thing said or done by a Companion is
proved to be wrong. But wicked indeed would be the person who went
beyond describing a wrong act as wrong and started reproving and
finding fault with the Companions of the Holy Prophet of Allah.

of Holy Prophet's being affected by Magic</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
second thing that has arisen in respect of these two Surahs is that,
according to traditions, magic had been worked on the Holy Prophet,
and he had fallen ill under its effect, and Gabriel (peace be on him)
had instructed him to repeat these Surahs to remove the charm. This
has been objected to by many rationalists of both ancient and modern
times. They say that if these traditions are accepted, the whole

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">becomes doubtful. For if the Prophet
could be charmed, and according to these traditions he was charmed,
one cannot say what the Prophet might have been made to say and do
under the influence of magic by his opponents, and what in his
teaching may be Divine and what the result of magic. Not only this:
they also allege that if this is accepted as true, it might well be
that the Prophet might have been prompted to make the claim to
Prophethood through magic and the Prophet by misunderstanding might
have thought that an angel had come to him. They also argue that
these traditions clash with the Qur'an. The Qur'an mentions the
accusation of the disbelievers who said that the Prophet was
bewitched (Bani Isra'il: 47), but these traditions confirm the
accusation of the disbelievers that the Prophet had actually been
charmed and bewitched. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>For
a proper investigation of this question it is necessary that one
should first see whether it is established by authentic historical
evidence that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had actually been
affected by magic, and if so, what it was and to what extent. Then it
should be seen whether the objections raised against what is
established historically do actually apply to it or not. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Muslim scholars of the earliest period were truly honest and upright
in that they did not try to corrupt history or conceal facts
according to their own ideas, concepts and assumptions. They conveyed
intact to the later generations whatever was confirmed historically,

used by the one who was bent upon drawing perverse conclusions from
the facts. Now, if something stands confirmed by authentic and
historical means, it is neither right for an honest and right-minded
person that he should deny history on the ground that in case he
accepted it, it would lead to these evil results according to his
thinking, nor it is right that he should add to and stretch beyond
its genuine limits by conjecture and speculation whatever is

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
the peace treaty of Hudaibiyah when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) returned to Madinah, a deputation of the Jews of Khaibar
visited Madinah in Muharram, A.H. 7 and met a famous magician, Labid
bin Asam, who belonged to the Ansar tribe of Bani Zurayq. They said
to him: &quot;You know how Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
blessings) has treated us. We have tried our best to bewitch him but
have not succeeded. Now we have come to you because you are a more
skilled magician. Here are three gold coins, accept these and cast a
powerful magic spell on Muhammad.&quot; In those days the Holy
Prophet had a Jewish boy as his attendant. Through him they obtained
a piece of the Holy Prophet's comb with some hair stuck to it. Magic
was worked on the same hair and the teeth of the comb. According to
some traditions, magic was worked by Labid bin Asam himself,
according to others, his sisters were more skilled than him and he
got the spell cast through them. Whatever be the case, Labid placed
this spell in the spathe of a male date-tree and his it under a stone
at the bottom of Dharwan or Dhi Arwan, the well of Bani Zurayq. The
spell took one whole year to have effect upon the Holy Prophet (upon
whom be peace). In the latter half of the year the Holy Prophet
started feeling as if was unwell. The last forty days became hard on
him, of which the last three days were even harder. But its maximum
effect on him was that he way melting away from within. He thought he
had done a thing whereas, in fact, he had not done it: he thought he
had visited his wives whereas he had not visited them; and sometimes
he would doubt having seen something whereas, in fact, he had not
seen it. All these effects were confined to his own person; so much
so that the other people could not notice what state he was passing
through. As for his being a Prophet, no change occurred in the
performance of his duties. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">There
is no tradition to say that he might have forgotten some verses of
the Qur'an in those days, or might have recited a verse wrongly, or a
change might have occurred in the assemblies and in his counsels and
sermons, or he might have presented a discourse as Revelation which
may not have been revealed to him, or he might have missed a Prayer
and thought that he had performed it. God forbid, if any such thing
had happened, it would have caused a clamor and the whole of Arabia
would have known that a magician had overpowered the one whom no
power had been able to overpower. But the Holy Prophet's position as
a Prophet remained wholly unaffected by it. Only in his personal life
he remained worried on account of it. At last, one day when he was in
the house of Hadrat Aishah, he prayed to Allah to be restored to full
health. In the meantime he fell asleep or drowsed and on waking he
said to Hadrat Aishah: &quot;My Lord has told me what I had asked of
Him.&quot; Hadrat Aishah asked what it was. He replied: &quot;Two men
(i.e. two angels in human guise) came to me. One sat near my head and
the other near my feet. The first asked: what has happened to him?
The other replied: Magic has been worked on him. The first asked: who
has worked it? He replied: Labid bin Asam. He asked: In what is it
contained? He replied: In the comb and hair covered in the spathe of
a male date-tree. He asked: where is it? He replied: under a stone at
the bottom of Dhi Arwan (or Dharwan), the well of Bani Zurayq. He
asked: what should be done about it? He replied: the well should be
emptied and it should be taken out from under the stone. The Holy
Prophet then sent Hadrat Ali, Hadrat Ammar bin Yasir and Hadrat
Zubair: They were also joined by Jubair bin Iyas az-Zurqi (two men
from Bani Zurayq). Later the Holy Prophet also arrived at the well
along with some Companions. The water was taken out and the spathe
recovered. There they found that beside the comb and hair there was a
cord with eleven knots on it and a wax image with needles pricked
into it. Gabriel (peace be on him) came and told him to repeat the
</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Mu'awwidhatayn</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
As he repeated verse after verse, a knot was loosened and a needle
taken out every time, till on finishing the last words all the knots
were loosened and all the needles removed, and he was entirely freed
from the charm. After this he called Labid and questioned him. He
confessed his guilt and the Holy Prophet let him go, for he never
avenged himself on anyone for any harm done to his person. He even
declined to talk about it to others, saying that Allah had restored
him to health; therefore he did not like that he should incite the
people against anyone. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">This
is the story of the magic worked on the Holy Prophet. There if
nothing in it which might run counter to his office of Prophethood.
In his personal capacity if any injury could be inflicted on him as
it happened in the Battle of Uhud, if he could fall from his horse
and be hurt as is confirmed by the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hadith</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,
if he could be stung by a scorpion as has been mentioned in some
Traditions and none of these negates the protection promised him by
Allah in his capacity as a Prophet, he could also fall ill under the
influence of magic in his personal capacity. That a Prophet can be
affected by magic is also confirmed by the Qur'an. In Surah Al- A'raf
it has been said about the magicians of Pharaoh that when they
confronted the Prophet Moses, they bewitched the eyes of thousands of
people who had assembled to witness the encounter (v. 116). In Surah
Ta Ha it has been said that not only the common people but the
Prophet Moses too felt that the cords and staffs that they cast were
running towards them like so many snakes, and this filled Moses'
heart with fear. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: &quot;Don't fear
for you will come out victorious. Cast down you staff.&quot; (vv.
66-69). As for the objection that this then confirms the accusation
of the disbelievers of Makkah that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) was a bewitched man, its answer is that the disbelievers did
not call him a bewitched man in the sense that he had fallen ill
under that effect of magic cast by somebody, but in the sense that
some magician has, God forbid, made him mad, and he had made claim to
Prophethood and was telling the people tales of Hell and Heaven in
his same madness. Now, obviously this objection does not at all apply
to a matter about which history confirms that the magic spell had
affected only the person of Muhammad (upon whom be peace) and not the
Prophethood of Muhammad (upon whom be peace), which remained wholly
unaffected by it. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this connection, another thing worthy of mention is that the people
who regard magic as a kind of superstition hold this view only
because the effect of magic cannot be explained scientifically. But
there are many things in the world which one experiences and observes
but one cannot explain scientifically how they happen. If we cannot
give any such explanation it does not become necessary that we should
deny the thing itself which we cannot explain. Magic, in fact, is a
psychological phenomenon which can affect the body through the mind
just as physical things affect the mind through the body. Fear, for
instance, is a psychological phenomenon, but it affects the body: the
hair stand on end and the body shudders. Magic does not; in fact,
change the reality, but under its influence man's mind and senses
start feeling as if reality had changed. The staffs and the cords
that the magicians had thrown towards the Prophet Moses, had not
actually become snakes, but the eyes of the multitude of people were
so bewitched that everybody felt they were snakes; even the senses of
the Prophet Moses could not remain unaffected by the magic spell.
Likewise, in Al-Baqarah: 102, it has been said that in Babylon people
learned such magic from Harut and Marut as could cause division
between husband and wife. This too was a psychological phenomenon.
Obviously, if the people did not find it efficacious by experience
they could not become its customers. No doubt, it is correct that
just like the bullet of the rifle and the bomb from the aircraft,
magic too cannot have effect without Allah's permission, but it would
be mere stubbornness to deny a thing which has been experienced and
observed by man for thousands for years. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

for every disease and exhorted his followers to use cures. He himself
told the people the remedies for certain diseases, as can be seen in

otherwise if the cure and medical treatment were beneficial in every
case, no one would have died in hospitals. Now, if beside the cure
and medical treatment, Allah's Word and His beautiful names also are
made use of, or Word and His beautiful names also are made use of, or
Allah is turned to and invoked for help by means of His Word, Names
and Attributes in a place where no medical aid is available, it would
not be against reason except for the materialists. However, it is not
right to disregard intentionally a cure or treatment where it is
available, and recourse had only to enchanting and reciting of
charms, and the people should start a regular practice of granting
amulets as a means of earning their livelihood. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Many
people in this regard argue from Hadrat Abu Said Khudri's tradition
which has been related in Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad,
Abu Daud and Ibn Majah, and it is supported also by a tradition
related in Bukhari on the authority of Ibn Abbas. According to it the
Holy Prophet sent some of his Companions including Hadrat Abu Said
Khudri on an expedition. They halted on the way at the settlement of
an Arabian tribe and demanded hospitality from the people, but they
refused to extend any hospitality. In the meantime the chief of the
tribe was stung by a scorpion and the people came to the travelers to
ask if they had any medicine or formula by which their chief could be
cured. Hadrat Abu Said said: &quot;Yes, we do have, but since you
have refused us hospitality, we would not treat him unless you
promised us to give us something.&quot; They promised to give them a
flock of goats (according to some traditions, 30 goats), and Hadrat
Abu Said went and started reciting Surah Al-Fatihah and rubbing his
saliva on the affected place. Consequently, the chief felt relieved
of the effect of the poison and the people of the tribe gave them the
goats as promised. But the Companions said to one another; &quot;Let
us not make any use of the goats until we have asked the Holy Prophet
about it&quot;, for they were not sure whether it was permissible to
accept any reward for what they had done. So they came before the
Holy Prophet and related what had happened. The Holy Prophet smiled
and said: &quot;How did you know that Surah Al-Fatihah could also be
used for curing such troubles? Take the goats and allocate my share
also in it.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">for permission to adopt a regular
profession of granting amulets and reciting charms, one should keep
in view the conditions under which Hadrat Abu Said Khudri had
recourse to it, and the Holy Prophet not only held it as permissible
but also said that a share for him also should be allocated so that
there remained no doubt in the minds of the Companions that such a
thing was permissible. The conditions in Arabia in those days were,
as they still are, that settlements were situated hundreds of miles
apart, there were not hotels and restaurants where a traveler could
buy food when he reached one of these after several days journey.
Under such conditions it was considered a moral duty that when a
traveler reached a settlement the people of the place should extend
hospitality to him. Refusal on their part in many cases meant death
for the travelers, and this was looked upon as highly blameworthy
among the Arabs. That is why the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
allowed as permissible the act of his Companions. Since the people of
the tribe had refused them hospitality, they too refused to treat
their chief, and became ready to treat him only on the condition that
they should promise to give them something in return. Then, when one
of them with trust in God recited Surah Al-Fatihah over the chief and
he became well, the people gave the promised wages and the Holy
Prophet allowed that the wages be accepted as lawful and pure. In
Bukhari the tradition related on the authority of Hadrat Abdullah bin
Abbas about this incident contains the Holy Prophet's words to the
effect: &quot;Instead that you should have acted otherwise, it was
better that you recited the Book of Allah and accepted the wages for
it.&quot; He said this in order to impress the truth that Allah's
Word is superior to every other kind of enchanting and practice of
secret arts. Furthermore, the Message also was incidentally conveyed
to the Arabian tribe and its people made aware of the blessings of
the Word that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) had brought from
Allah. This incident cannot be cited as a precedent for the people
who run clinic in the cities and towns for the practice of secret
arts and have adopted it as a regular profession for earning
livelihood. No precedent of it is found in the life and practice of
the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) or his Companions, their
followers and the earliest Imams. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

chronologically, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) arranged in
the present order the verses and Surahs revealed during 23 years on

himself but by the command of Allah Who revealed them. According to

Now, let us have a look at the two. In the beginning, after praising

Master of the Judgment Day, the servants submits: &quot;Lord, You
alone I worship and to You along I turn for help, and the most urgent
help that I need from You is to be guided to the Straight Way.&quot;
In answer, he is given by Allah the whole Qur'an to show him the
Straight Way, which is concluded thus: Man prays to Allah, Who is
Lord of dawn, Lord of men, King of men, Deity of men, saying: &quot;I
seek refuge only with You for protection from every evil and mischief
of every creature, and in particular, from the evil whisperings of
devils, be they from among men or jinn, for they are the greatest
obstacle in following the Straight Way.&quot; The relation that the
beginning bears with the end, cannot remain hidden from anyone who
has understanding and insight. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

	i.e. Sustainer, Providence and Master of all mankind; third, that He
	is Ilah-un-nas, i.e. real Deity of all mankind, (Here, one should
	clearly understand that the word ilah has been used in two meanings
	in the Qur'an: first for the thing or person who is practically
	being worshiped although it or he is not entitled to worship;
	second, for Him Who is ' entitled to worship, Who is in fact the
	Deity whether the people worship Him or not, wherever this word is
	used for Allah; it has been used in the second meaning). Seeking
	refuge by means of these throe attributes means: &quot;I seek refuge
	with that God, Who being the Sustainer, King and Deity of men, has
	full power over them, can fully protect them and can really save
	them from the evil, to save myself and others from which 1 am
	seeking His refuge. Not only this: since He alone is Sustainer, King
	and Deity, therefore, there is no one beside Him with Whom I may
	seek refuge and he may give real refuge.&quot;&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>The
	word waswas in waswas-il-khannas means the one who whispers over and
	over again, and waswasa means to whisper into someone's heart an
	evil suggestion over and over again in such a way or ways that the
	one who is being inspired may not feel that the whisperer is
	whispering an evil suggestion into his heart. Waswasah by itself
	suggests repetition just as zalzalah contains the meaning of
	repetitive movement. Since man is not tempted by just one attempt
	but effort has to be made over and over again to seduce and tempt
	him, such all attempt is called waswasah and the tempter waswas. As
	for the word khannas, it is derived from khunus, which means to hide
	after appearing and to retreat after coming into view. Since khannas
	is the intensive form, it would imply the one who behaves thus very
	frequently. Now, obviously the whisperer has to approach man for
	whispering again and again, and besides, when he is also described
	as khannas, the combination of the two words by 'itself gives the
	meaning that after whispering once he retreats and then again
	returns over and over again to repeat the act of whispering. In
	other words, when once he fails in his attempt to whisper evil, he
	withdraws, then he again returns to make the second and the third
	and the next attempt over and over again. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After
	understanding the meaning of waswas-il-khannas, let us consider what
	is meant by seeking refuge from its evil. Its one meaning is that
	the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil,
	i.e. from the evil lest it should whisper some evil suggestion into
	his own heart. The second meaning is that the caller to Truth seeks
	God's refuge from the evil of the one who whispers evil suggestions
	into the hearts of the people against himself. It is not in his own
	power to approach all the people in whose hearts evil suggestions
	are being whispered against himself individually and remove the
	misunderstandings of every person. It is also not right and proper
	for him that he should give up his mission of inviting others to
	Allah and should devote all his tune and energy to removing the
	misunderstanding created by the whisperer and to answering their
	accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should stoop to
	the level of his opponents. Therefore, Allah has instructed the
	caller to Truth to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked
	people, and then to attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation
	and mission. For it is not for him to deal with them but for Allah,
	who is Sustainer of men, King of,men, God of men. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, one
	should also understand that an evil suggestion is the starting ,
	point of evil act. When it affects a careless or heedless person, it
	creates in him a desire for evil. Then, further whisperings change
	the evil desire into an evil intention and evil purpose. When the
	evil suggestion grows in intensity, the intention becomes a
	resolution, which then culminates in the evil act. Therefore, the
	meaning of seeking God's refuge from the evil of the whisperer is
	that Allah should nip the evil in the bud. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">If seen
	from another aspect, the order of the evil of the whisperers seems
	to be this: first. they incite one to open unbelief, polytheism, or
	rebellion against Allah and His Messenger, and enmity of the
	righteous (godly) people. If they fail in this and a person does
	enter Allah's religion, they misguide him to some innovation. If
	they fail in this too, they tempt him to sin. If they do not succeed
	even in this, they inspire the man with the suggestion that there is
	no harm in indulging in minor sins, so that if he starts committing
	these freely, he is over burdened with sin. If one escapes from this
	too, in the last resort they try that one should keep the true
	religion confined to oneself, and should do nothing to make it
	prevail, but if a person defeats all these plans, the whole party of
	the devils froth among men and jinn makes a common front against him
	incites and stirs up the people and makes them shower him with
	invective and accusation and slander, and defames him as widely as
	it can. Then, Satan comes to the believer and excites him to anger,
	saying: &quot;It is cowardly of you to have borne all this insult:
	arise and clash with your opponents.&quot; This is the last and
	final device with Satan by which he tries to thwart the struggle of
	the caller to Truth and entangle him in difficulties and
	obstructions. If he succeeds in escaping from this too, Satan
	becomes powerless before him. About this same thing it has been said
	in the Qur'an: &quot;If Satan ever excites you to anger, seek refuge
	with Allah.&quot; (Al-A`raf: 200, Ha Mim As-Sajdah: 36); 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Say:
	Lord, I seek refuge with You from the promptings of satans.&quot;
	(Al-Mu'minun: 97); 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	fact is that if ever an evil suggestion from Satan so much as
	touches those, who are God-fearing people, they immediately get
	alerted and clearly see the right course they should adopt.&quot;
	(AI-A`raf: 201). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And on
	this very basis about the people who escape from this last attack of
	Satan Allah says: &quot;None can attain to this rank except those
	who are men of great good fortune.&quot; (Ha Mim As-Sajdah: 35).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, another thing also should be kept in mind, and it is
	this: EviL suggestion is not whispered into the heart of man only
	from outside by the satans from among men and jinn, but also by the
	self of man from within. His own wrong theories misguide his
	intellect, his own unlawful motives and desires lead his power of
	discrimination, will and power of judgment astray, and it is not
	only the satans from outside but within tnan his satan of the self
	also beguiles him. This same thing has been expressed in the Qur'an,
	thus: &quot;and We know the evil suggestions arising from his self.&quot;
	(Qaf : 16). On this very basis, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) in his well-known Sermon said: &quot;We seek Allah's refuge
	from the evils of our self.&quot;&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>According
	to some scholars, these words mean that the whisperer whispers evil
	into the hearts of two kinds of people: the jinn and the men. If
	this meaning is admitted, the word nas would apply to both jinn and
	men. They say that this can be so, for when the word rijali (men) in
	the Qur'an has been used for the jinn, as in Al-Jinn: 6, and when
	nafar can be used for the group of jinn, as in A1-Ahqaf: 29, men and
	jinn both can be included metaphorically in the word nas also. But
	this view is wrong because the words nas, ins and ihsan are even
	lexically contrary in meaning to the word jinn. The actual meaning
	of jinn is hidden creation and jinn is called jinn because he is
	hidden from man's eye. On the contrary, the words nas and ins are
	spoken for insan (man) only on the basis that he is manifest and
	visible and perceptible. In Surah Al-Qasas: 29, the word anasa has
	been used in the meaning of ra a, i.e. &quot;the Prophet Moses saw a
	fire in the direction of Tur. &quot; In Surah An-Nisa': 6, the word
	anastum has been used in the meaning of ahsastum or ra aytum (i.e.
	if you perceive or see that the orphans have become capable).
	Therefore, nas cannot apply to jinn lexically, and the correct
	meaning of the verse is: &quot;from the evil of the whisperer who
	whispers evil into the hearts of men, whether he be from among the
	jinn or from the men themselves.&quot; In other words, whispering of
	evil is done by devils from among jinn as well as by devils from
	among rnen and the prayer in this Surah has been taught to seek
	refuge from the evil of both. This meaning is supported by the
	Qur'an as well as by the Hadith. The Qur'an says: &quot;And so it
	has always been that We set against every Prophet enemies from among
	devils of men and devils of jinn, who have been inspiring one
	another with charming things to delude the minds.&quot; (Al-An'am
	:112) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And in
	the Hadith, lmam Ahmad, Nasa'i, and Ibn Hibban have related on the
	authority of Hadrat Abu Dharr a tradition, saying: &quot;I sat
	before the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace), who was in the Mosque.
	He said: Abu Dharr, have you performed the Prayer? I replied in the
	negative. He said: Arise and perform the Prayer. So, I performed the
	Prayer. The Holy Prophet said: O Abu Dharr, seek Allah's refuge from
	the devils of men and the devils of jinn. I asked. are there devils
	among men also? O Messenger of Allah! He replied: Yes.&quot;</P>
