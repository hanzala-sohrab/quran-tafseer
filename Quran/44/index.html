<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Its
period of revelation also could not be determined from any authentic
tradition, but the internal evidence of the subject matter shows that
this Surah too was sent down in the same period in which Surah
Zukhruf and a few other earlier Surahs had been revealed. However,
this Surah was sent down somewhat later. Its historical background is
this: When the disbelievers of Makkah became more and more
antagonistic in their attitude and conduct, the Holy Prophet prayed:
O God, help me with a famine like the famine of Joseph. He thought
that when the people would be afflicted with a calamity, they would
remember God, their hearts would soften and they would accept the
admonition. Allah granted his prayer, and the whole land was
overtaken by such a terrible famine that the people were sorely
distressed. At last, some of the Quraish chiefs among whom Hadrat
Abdullah bin Masud has particularly mentioned the name of Abu Sufyan
came to the Holy Prophet and requested him to pray to Allah to
deliver his people from the calamity. On this occasion Allah sent
down this Surah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this introduction, the question of the famine that was raging in
Makkah has been discussed. As already mentioned, this famine had
occurred on the Holy Prophet's prayer, and he had prayed for it so
that when the calamity befell it would break the stubbornness of the
disbelievers and then they would listen to the rebuke. It looked as
if this expectation was being fulfilled to some extent, for some of
the most stubborn enemies of the Truth, on account of the severities
of the famine, had cried out: &quot;O Lord, avert this torment from
us and we will believe.&quot; At this, on the one hand, the Holy
Prophet has been foretold :&quot;These people will not learn any
lesson from such calamities. When they have turned away from the
Messenger, whose life, character, works and speech clearly show that
he is Allah's true Messenger, how will a mere famine help remove
their disbelief?&quot; On the other, the unbelievers have been
addressed, so as to say : &quot;You lie when you say that you will
believe as soon as the torment is removed from you. We shall just
remove it to see how sincere you are in your promise. There is a
graver disaster about to fall upon you. You need a much more crushing
blow :minor misfortunes cannot set you right.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this very connection, a reference has been made a little below to
Pharaoh and his people, implying that those people also had met with
precisely the same trial as the chiefs of the disbelieving Quraish
are now afflicted. To them also a similar noble and honorable
Messenger had come; they also had seen those express pointers and
signs which clearly showed that he had been appointed by Allah; they
also had gone on witnessing one sign after the other but they did not
give up their stubbornness, till at last they made up their mind to
put an end to the Messenger's life, and they met their doom, which
has since become an object lesson for the people for ever. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this the theme of the Hereafter has been taken up, which the
disbelievers of Makkah vehemently denied. They said: &quot;We have
never seen anyone rising back to life after death. Raise our
forefathers back to life if you are true in your claim about the life
hereafter.&quot; In response to this, two arguments for the Hereafter
have been presented briefly (1) That the denial of this creed has
always proved destructive for the morals; and (2) that the universe
is not a plaything of a thoughtless deity, but it is a wise system
and no work of wisdom is ever vain or useless. Then the disbelievers
demand to bring their forefathers back to life has been answered,
thus : &quot;This cannot be done every day to meet the demand of the
individuals, but Allah has appointed a time when He will resurrect
all mankind simultaneously and will subject them to accountability in
His Court. If one has to protect oneself there, one should think
about it here. For no one will be able to save himself there by his
own power, nor by the power of any one else.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
connection with this Court of Allah, mention has been made of the
fate of those who will be declared as culprits and of the rewards of
those who will be declared as successful. The discourse has been
concluded with this warning: &quot;This Quran has been revealed in
simple language in your own tongue so that you may understand it; yet
if you do not understand it and insist on seeing your evil end, you
may wait; Our Prophet too is waiting. Whatever is to happen, will
happen at its own appointed time.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	involved in the misunderstanding that this is the 15th night of
	Sha'ban, for in some traditions it has been said that the destinies

	Malik, Dahhak and many other commentators are agreed that this is
	the same night of Ramadan, which has been called lailat-ul-qadr, for
	the Qur'an itself has stated this, and where any Qur'anic statement
	exists, no other view can be formed on the basis of random reports.

	this brief sentence an allusion has been made to an important truth.
	Even atheists or polytheists do come across occasions when their
	bean from within says; There is somewhere some weakness in the creed
	that you have adopted. The atheist may apparently be very firm in
	his denial of God, his heart at one or the other time does bear the
	testimony that this wonderful and wise system which extends from the
	particle of dust to the galaxies and from a blade of grass to the
	creation of man, could not come into existence without an All-Wise
	Designer. Likewise, a polytheist may be deeply submerged in his
	polytheism, his heart also sometimes cries out: Those whom you have
	adopted as deities cannot be God. But this testimony of the heart
	neither leads the atheist and the polytheist to the conviction
	about, the existence and Oneness of God, nor to conviction and
	satisfaction about their creed of atheism and polytheism itself.
	Instead, their religion, in fact, is based on doubt, no matter how
	convinced they might appear to be of its truth. As for the question:
	Why doesn't this doubt make them restless, and why don't, they seek
	the truth seriously so as to obtain a satisfactory ground for their
	convictions? the answer is: they lack seriousness in religious
	matters. W hat they really regard as important are the worldly
	earnings and acquisitions and their enjoyment, in search of which
	they expend all their powers and abilities of the heart and mind and
	body. As for the religious matters, they are in fact no more than
	fun, a mere pastime, amusement, or a mental diversion for them, for
	which they cannot spare even a few moments of serious study.
	Religious rites are being performed as an entertainment; discussions
	about denial and atheism are being engaged in as an amusement; no
	one can spare a few moments from his worldly pursuits to consider
	whether he has turned away from the Truth, and if so, what would be
	its consequences.&nbsp;

	Companions. Masruq, the well-known pupil of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin
	Mas'ud, states: One day when we entered the mosque of Kufah, we saw
	a preacher addressing the people. He recited the verse: Yauma
	ta'tis-sama-u bidukhan-im-mubin, then asked: &quot;Do you know what
	kind of smoke it is ? This smoke will appear on the Day of
	Resurrection and will make the disbelievers and the hypocrites blind
	and deaf, but the believers will be affected only to the extent as
	if they had caught cold.' Hearing this commentary we went to Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin Mas'ud and reported to him what the preacher had said.
	Hadrat 'Abdullah at that time was lying down. On hearing this
	commentary he sat up startled and said: &quot;When a person does not
	have the knowledge he should ask those who have it. The fact is that
	when the people of the Quraish went on refusing to accept Islam and
	continued to oppose the Holy Prophet, the Holy Prophet prayed: O
	God, help me with a famine like the famine of Joseph (peace be upon
	him); consequently, a very severe famine overtook Makkah and the
	people were forced to eat bones, skins and carrion. The conditions
	became so bad that whoever looked up to the sky would see nothing
	but smoke due to intensity of hunger. At last, Abu Sufyan came to
	the Holy Prophet and said: &quot;You tell the people to treat their
	kindred kindly: your own people are starving: kindly pray to God to
	remove this calamity.&quot; This was the time when the people of the
	Quraish had started saying: &quot;O God, if You remove this torment
	from us, we will believe.&quot; This same event has been referred to
	in these verses; and the severest blow implies the calamity that was
	inflicted on the Quraish in the Battle of Badr. &quot; This
	tradition has been related by Imam Ahmad, Bukhari Tirmidhi, Nasa'i,
	Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abi Hatim from Masruq with several chains of
	authorities. Besides Masruq, Ibrahim Nakha'i Qatadah. `Asim and
	'Amir also have related that Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud had given
	the same commentary of this verse. Therefore there cannot be any
	doubt that Ibn Mas'ud actually held this same opinion. Among the
	immediate followers of the Companions, Mujahid, Qatadah. Abul
	'Aliyah, Muqatil, Ibrahim Nakha'i, Dahhak and 'Atiyyah al-'Aufi and
	others havc also concurred with Ibn Mas'ud in this commentary. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On the
	contrary, scholars like Hadrat 'Ali, Ibn 'Umar, Ibn 'Abbas, Abu Said
	Khudri, Zaid bin 'AIi, and Hasan Basri say that in these verses
	mention has been made of the time just before Resurrection, and the
	smoke that has been foretold will envelop the earth at that time.
	This commentary is further strengthened by the Traditions that have
	been reported from the Holy Prophet. Hudhaifah bin Asid al-Ghifari
	says: One day when we were talking about Resurrection, the Holy
	Prophet came out to us and said: &quot;Resurrection will not be
	established till ten Signs have appeared one after the other: Rising
	of the sun in the west, smoke, the beast, emergence of God and
	Magog, descent of Jesus son of Mary, sinking of the earth in the
	East, in the West and in the Arabian Peninsula, and the appearance
	of a fire from Yemen, which will drive the people away.&quot;
	(Muslim) This is confirmed by Abu Malik Ash`ari's tradition which
	has been related by Ibn Jarir and Tabarani, and Abu Said Khudri's
	tradition which has been related by Ibn Abi Hatim. Both these
	traditions show that the Holy Prophet regarded the smoke as one of
	the Signs of Resurrection and also said that when that smoke will
	spread, it will affect the believer only like a cold, but will
	infuse every nerve of the disbeliever and come out from every part
	of his body. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A study
	of the verses under consideration can remove the disparity between
	the two commentaries. As for the commentary of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin
	Mas'ud, it is a fact that a severe famine had hit Makkah resulting
	from the Holy Prophet's prayer and it had unnerved the disbelievers
	considerably and they had requested the Holy Prophet to pray for its
	removal, as referred to at several places in the Qur'an. (See
	AI-An'am: 43, AI-A'raf: 94-95, Yunus: 21, AI-Mu'minun: 75-77 and the
	corresponding E.N.'s). In these verses also there is a clear pointer
	to the same conditions. The disbelievers' saying: &quot;Our Lord,
	remove this torment from us: we will believe,&quot; Allah's saying:
	&quot;How can they rid themselves of their heedlessness? Even when a
	manifest Messenger came to them, they paid no heed to hira, and
	said: He is a madman taught by others,&quot;- then saying: &quot;Were
	We to remove the torment a little, you would revert to the same that
	you were doing before.&quot; all this can be relevant only if it
	refers to the conditions of the Holy Prophet's time. To apply them
	to what will happen near the time of Resurrection, is not correct.
	Therefore, in view of this, Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas'ud's commentary
	seems to be correct, but its this part that &quot;the smoke&quot;
	also had appeared in that very time, in that when the people in
	their extreme state of hunger looked up to the sky, they could see
	nothing but smoke, does not seem to be correct. It also does not
	conform to the apparent words of the Qur'an and is against the
	Traditions as well. The Qur'an does not say: the sky brought forth
	the smoke and it spread over the people; but it says: &quot;Wait for
	the Day when the sky will appear with a visible smoke, and it will
	envelop mankind. &quot; A study of the subsequent verses clearly
	points to this meaning: &quot;When you do not believe even after the
	Messenger's admonition, nor take heed from the warning given in the
	shape of the famine, then you should wait for Resurrection. At that
	time when you sec your doom confronting you, you will fully realize
	what was the truth and what was falsehood.&quot; Therefore, as for
	the smoke, the correct view is that it has nothing to do with the
	time of the famine, but it is a Sign of Resurrection and the same is
	also confirmed by the Hadith. It is surprising that those
	commentators who confirmed what Hadrat Ibn Mas`ud said confirmed him
	wholly and those who refined what he said refined him wholly,
	whereas a study of the verses and the Hadith clearly shows how far
	he was correct and how far he was wrong.&nbsp;

	they would like in any measure they would demand, and it will be
	presented before them. In this world, a man cannot ask for a thing
	in a hotel, or even his own things in his own house, with the
	freedom and satisfaction as he will ask for these in Paradise, for
	in the world nothing is found anywhere in un-limited measure;
	whatever man uses here, he has to pay for it. In Paradise, things
	will belong to Allah, and the servants will enjoy full freedom to
	use them. Neither will there be the danger of the failure of the
	supply, nor the necessity of a bill to pay.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote44">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote44sym" HREF="#sdfootnote44anc">44</A>Two
	things are worthy of notice in this verse. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	after mentioning the blessings of Paradise special mention has been
	made of being secure from Hell separately whereas a person's entry
	into Paradise by itself amounts to his being safe from Hell. This is
	because man can feel the worth of the reward of obedience fully only
	when he is informed what end the disobedient people have met and
	from what evil end he himself has ban saved. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	Allah is mentioning those people's safety from Hell and their entry
	into Paradise as a result of His own grace. This is meant to warn
	man of the truth that this success cannot be achieved by any person
	unless he is blessed by Allah's grace. Although man will be rewarded
	for his own good deeds, in the first place he cannot do good unless
	favored by Allah's succor; then even the best deed that man is able
	to perform, cannot be absolutely perfect and none can claim that it
	is flawless and faultless. It is only Allah's bounty that He should
	overlook the servant's weaknesses and defects in his actions and
	accept his services and bless him with rewards; otherwise if He
	resorts to minute accountability no one can dare claim to win
	Paradise only on the strength of his own deeds. The same thing has
	been said by the Holy Prophet in a Hadith to the effect: &quot;Act
	and try to act as righteously as you possibly can, but know that the
	action of a person alone will not make him enter Paradise. It was
	asked: What about your own action, O Messenger of Allah? He replied:
	Yes, even I won't enter Paradise on the strength of my actions,
	unless of course, my Lord covers me up in His mercy.&quot;&nbsp;

	wait to see how they are visited by their doom; and they also are
	waiting to see what becomes of the message that you are giving them.
