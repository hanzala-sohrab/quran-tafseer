that in the initial stage the preaching of the Holy Prophet (upon

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At
the outset, in order to arouse the people from their heedlessness,
they have been plainly asked:&quot;Do you have any knowledge of the
time when an overwhelming calamity will descend?&quot; Immediately
after this details of the impending calamity are given as to how the
people will be divided into two separate groups and will meet
separate ends. One group of the people will go to Hell and they will
suffer punishment; the second group will go to the sublime Paradise
and will be provided with, blessings. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">and the news of the Hereafter being
given by the Qur'an, observe the common things which they experience
daily in their lives? Do they never consider how the camels, on whom
their whole life activity in the Arabian desert depends, came into
being, endowed precisely with the same characteristics as were
required for the beast needed in their desert life? When they go on
their journeys, they see the sky, the mountains, or the earth. Let
them ponder over these three phenomena and consider as to how the sky
was stretched above them, how the mountains were erected and how the
earth was spread beneath them? Has all this come about without the
skill and craftsmanship of an All- Powerful, All Wise Designer? If
they acknowledge that a Creator has created all this with great
wisdom and power and that no one else is an associate with Him in
their creation, why then do they refuse to accept Him alone as their
Lord and Sustainer? And if they acknowledge that that God had the
power to create all this, then on what rational ground do they
hesitate to acknowledge that that God also has the power to bring
about Resurrection, to recreate man, and to make Hell and Heaven? </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

making the truth plain by this concise and rational argument, the
address turns from the disbelievers to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) and he is told: &quot;If these people do not acknowledge the
truth, they may not; you have not been empowered to act with
authority over them, so that you should coerce them into believing:
your only task is to exhort, so exhort them. Ultimately they have to
return to Us; then We shall call them to full account and shall
inflict a heavy punishment on those who do not believe.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
