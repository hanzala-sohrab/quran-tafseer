place, it should only be in case all possibilities of mutual
reconciliation have been exhausted. For in the Divine Law provision
for divorce has been made only as an unavoidable necessity; otherwise
Allah does not approve that the marriage relationship that has been
established between a man and a woman should ever break. The Holy
Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) has said &quot;Allah has not
made lawful anything more hateful in His sight than divorce.&quot;

have been supplied to the following questions:What would be the
waiting period of the women, marriage with whom has been consummated
and who no longer menstruate, or those who have not yet menstruated,
in case they are divorced? What would be the waiting period of the
woman, who is pregnant, or the woman whose husband dies, if she is

	you have to divorce your wives, you should divorce them for their
	prescribed waiting-period.&quot; Pronouncing divorce for the waiting
	period has two meanings and both are implied here.</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First.
	That &quot;you should divorce them at a them when their
	waiting-period can begin. &quot; This thing has already been
	prescribed in Al-Baqarah: 228 above. The waiting-period of the
	married woman who menstruates is three monthly courses after the
	pronouncement of divorce. If this commandment is kept in view the
	only appropriate time of pronouncing divorce that the waiting period
	may duly begin is when she is not in her courses, for he
	waiting-period cannot begin from the course during which she ma have
	been divorced, and divorcing her in that state would mean that,
	contrary to the Divine Command, her waiting-period should extend to
	four courses instead of three courses. Furthermore, this commandment
	also demands that the woman should not he divorced in the period-of
	purity during which the husband may have had sexual intercourse with
	her. For in this case, at the time divorce is pronounced neither the
	husband nor the wife can know whether he has conceived in
	consequence of the intercourse or not. Because of this neither the
	waiting-period can begin on the hypothesis that this would be
	reckoned in view of the succeeding monthly courses, nor on the
	hypothesis that this would be the waiting-period of a pregnant
	woman. So, this commandment lays down two rules simultaneously:
	first, that divorce should not be pronounced during menstruation;
	second, that divorce may be pronounced either in the period of
	purity during which there was no sexual intercourse with the woman,
	or in the state when the woman's being pregnant was known. A little
	consideration of the matter will show that the restrictions imposed
	on the pronouncement of divorce are for good reasons. The reason for
	imposing the restriction on the pronounce meant of divorce during
	menstruation is that in this state the husband and the wife are
	somewhat estranged from each other because of the prohibition of
	sexual intercourse in this start; and from the medical viewpoint
	also it is confirmed that the woman is not temperamentally normal
	during the courses. Therefore, if a quarrel starts between them in
	this state, both the husband and the wife would be helpless to an
	extent to put an end to it, and if the matter is deferred till the
	woman is free from her courses, there is the possibility that the
	woman also may return to her normal temperamental state and the
	mutual attraction that nature has placed between them also may work
	and reunite them. Likewise, the reason for prohibiting the
	pronouncement of divorce during the purity period in which sexual
	intercourse may have taken place, is that if in consequence of it
	conception takes place, it can neither be known to the husband nor
	to the wife. Therefore, it cannot be a suitable time for pronouncing
	the divorce. If the man comes to know that conception has taken
	place, he would think a hundred times before deciding finally
	whether he should pronounce divorce or not on the woman who carries
	his child in her womb. The woman also in view of the future of her
	child would try her best to remove the causes of her husband's
	displeasure. ,But if a decision is taken blindly, in undue haste,
	and then it is known that conception had taken place, both will
	regret it later. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
	is the first meaning &quot;divorcing for the prescribed
	waiting-period&quot;, which applies only to those women marriage
	with whom has been consummated, who menstruate and may possibly
	conceive. As for its second meaning it is this: &quot;If you have to
	divorce your wives, you should divorce them till the expiry of their
	waiting-period&quot;. That is &quot;Do not pronounce three divorces
	all at once leading to permanent separation, but pronounce one, or
	at the most two divorces, and wait till the end of the
	waiting-period, so that there remains some chance for reconciliation
	for you at any time during this period.&quot; According to this
	meaning; this commandment is also useful in respect of those woman
	marriage with whom has been consummated and who menstruate as well
	as of those who no longer menstruate, or those who have not yet
	menstruated, or those whose pregnancy at the time of the
	pronouncement of divorce is known. If this Divine Command is rightly
	followed, no one will regret after having pronounced divorce, for if
	divorce is pronounced in this way, there remains room for
	reconciliation within the waiting. period, and even after the expiry
	of the waiting-period the possibility remains that the separated
	husband and wife may remarry if they wish reconciliation.</FONT></FONT></P>

	&quot;One should not pronounce divorce during menstruation nor in
	the period of purity (tuhr) during which the husband may have had
	sexual intercourse. But one should leave the wife alone till she
	attains purity after the course; then one may pronounce a single
	divorce on her. In this case even if there is no reconciliation and

	The Hanafis regard divorce as of three kinds: Ahsan. hasan, and
	bid'i. The ahsan form of divorce is that one may pronounce only one
	divorce on one's wife during a tuhr (purity) period in which one
	must refrain from sexual intercourse and leave the wife to complete
	her waiting-period. The hasan form of divorce is that one may
	pronounce one divorce in each period of purity: in this case
	pronouncement of three: divorces, one each in three periods of
	purity, . is also not against the Shari'ah, although the best
	approved method is to pronounce only one divorce and leave the wife
	to complete her waiting-period. The bid form of divorce is that one
	must pronounce three divorces in a single sitting, or pronounce
	three divorces at different times during the same period of purity,
	or pronounce divorce during menstruation, or pronounce it in the
	period of purity during which one has had a sexual intercourse. Of
	these whichever course one may adopt one will be guilty a sin, This
	is the law in respect of the woman Marriage with whom has been
	consummated and who has regular courses. As for the woman marriage
	with whom has not been consummated, she can be divorced both in the
	state of purity and during menstruation, and this is according to
	the Sunnah. And if the woman is such a one marriage with whom has
	been consummated who no longer menstruates, or the one who has not
	yet menstruated, she can be divorced even after the sexual
	intercourse&bdquo;for there is no chance of her being pregnant. And
	if the woman is pregnant, she also can be divorced after the sexual
	intercourse, for her pregnancy is already established. But the
	method of pronouncing divorce on these women according to the
	Sunnah, is that the divorce may be pronounced at the interval of one
	month in each case. However, the ahsan method is that only one
	divorce may be pronounced and the woman left to complete her waiting
	period. (Hedayah, fath alQadir, Ahkam al-Qur an (AI-Jassas), `Umdat

	and bid'i haram. The divorce according to the Sunnah is that a
	single divorce be pronounced on the woman marriage with whom has
	been consummated and who menstruates, during her state of purity
	without having had sexual intercourse, and the woman be left to
	complete her waiting-period. The bid'i makrnh form is that divorce

	been consummated and who menstruates is that a single divorce be
	pronounced on her in her period of purity without having had sexual

	during the courses, or divorced in the period of purity during which
	the husband has had sexual intercourse and her being pregnant is not
	known, all these would be disapproved and forbidden forms of
	divorce. But if the woman is such that marriage with her has been
	consummated but who no longer menstruates, or such who has not yet
	menstruated, or is pregnant, in her case there is neither any
	difference of approved and disapproved with regard to time nor with

	not with regard to number That is, to pronounce divorce on a woman

	menstruation or to pronounce divorce on a Ovarian, who can conceive,
	during such a period of purity in which the husband has had sexual

	disapproved and forbidden. As for the number, whether three divorces
	are pronounced at one time, or pronounced in the same period of

	A divorce being irregular, reprehensible, forbidden, or sinful with

	to all the four Sunni Schools, whether a divorce is pronounced
	during menstruation, or thrice at once, or pronounced in the period
	of purity during which the husband has had sexual intercourse and
	the woman's being pregnant is unknown, or pronounced in a manner
	disapproved by an Imam, in any case it does become effective,

	bin al-Musayyab and some other immediate followers of the Companions

	Shi`as. The basis of this opinion is that since this form of divorce
	is forbidden and utterly irregular, it is ineffective, whereas the
	AhadIth that we have cited above, clearly show that when Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife during menstruation, the Holy
	Prophet commanded him to take her back; had the divorce not taken
	effect at all, the command to take the wife back would have been
	meaningless. And this also confirmed by many Ahadith that the Holy

	and 'Ikrimah say that only one divorce takes place if divorce is
	pronounced thrice at once, and this very view has been adopted by
	Imam Ibn Taimiyyah. The source of his this opinion is that Abu
	as-Sahba' asked Ibn 'Abbas: 'Don't you know that in the lifetime of
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and Hadrat Abu Bakr
	and in the early period of Hadrat 'Umar a triple divorce was
	considered a single divorce? He replied: Yes.&quot; (Bukhari,
	Muslim). .And in Muslim, Abu Da'ud and Musnad Ahmad, Ibn Abbas's
	this statement has been cited: &quot;In the lifetime of the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace) and Hadrat Abu Bakr and during the
	first two years of the caliphate of Hadrat `Umar a triple divorce
	was considered a single divorce. Then Hadrat `Umar expressed the
	view: As the people have started acting hasty in a matter in which
	they had been advised to act judiciously and prudently, why should
	we not enforce this practice? So, he enforced It.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But
	this view is not acceptable for several reasons. In the first place,
	according to several traditions lbn `Abbas's own ruling was against
	it, as we have explained above. Secondly, it is contrary to those
	Ahadith also, which have been reported from tire Holy Prophet upon
	whom be peace) and the major Companions, in which the ruling given
	about the pronounce of a threefold divorce at one time is that all
	his three divorces become effective. These Ahadith also have been
	cited above Thirdly, from Ibn `Abbas's own tradition itself it
	becomes evident that Hadrat `Umar had publicly enforced the triple
	divorce in the assembly of the Companions, but neither then nor
	after it the Companions ever expressed any difference of opinion.
	Now, can it be conceived that Hadrat `Umar could decide an issue
	against the Sunnah? And could the Companions also accept his
	decision without protest? Furthermore, in the story concerning
	Rukanah bin `Abd-i Yazib, a tradition has been related by Abu Da'ud,
	Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah, Imam Shafe`i, Darimi and Hakim, saying that
	when Rukanah pronounced three divorces on his wife in one and the
	same sitting, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) asked him to
	state on oath whether his intention was to pronounce one divorce
	only, (That is, the two subsequent divorces were pronounced only to
	lay emphasis on the first divorce; the triple divorce was not
	intended to create separation permanently). And when he stated this
	on oath, the Holy Prophet gave him the right to take his wife back.
	`This brings out the truth of the matter as to what kind of divorces
	were considered a single divorce in the earliest period of Islam. On
	this very basis, the interpreters of the Hadith have explained the
	tradition of Ibn 'Abbas thus: As in the early period of Islam deceit
	and fraud in religious matters was almost unknown among the people,
	the statement of the pronouncer of a triple divorce was admitted
	that his real intention was to pronounce only a single divorce, and
	the two subsequent divorces had been pronounced only for the sake of
	emphasis. But when Hadrat `Umar saw that the people first pronounced
	three divorces in haste and then presented the excuse of pronouncing
	them only for the sake of emphasis, he refused to accept this
	excuse. Imam Nawawi and Imam Subki regard this as the beat
	interpretation of the tradition from Ibn `Abbas, Finally, there is
	disagreement in the traditions of Abu aa-Sahba' himself, which he
	has related concerning the saying of Ibn `Abbas. Muslim, Abu Da'ud
	and Nasa'i have related from this same Abu as-Sahba' another
	tradition; saying that on an inquiry by him. Ibn `Abbas said: ` When
	a person pronounced a threefold divorce on his wife before
	consummation of marriage, it was considered a single divorce in the
	lifetime of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and Hadrat Abu
	Bakr and in the early period of Hadrat 'Umar,&quot; Thus, one and
	the same reporter has reported from Ibn 'Abbas traditions containing
	two divergent themes and this diversity weakens both the traditions.

	As the Holy Prophet had commanded the pronouncer of the divorce
	during menstruation to take his wife back, the dispute has arisen
	among the jurists as to what is the exact sense of this command Imam
	Abu Hanifah, Imam Shafe'i, Imam Ahmad, Imam Auza'i, Ibn Abi Laila,
	Ishaq bin Rahawaih and Abu Thaur say that such a person would be
	commanded to take his wife back, but would not be compelled to do
	so. ('Umdat alQari). The Hanafi viewpoint as stated in Hedayah is
	that in this case taking the wife back is not only preferable but
	also obligatory. In Mughni al-Muhtaj' the Shafe'i viewpoint has been
	stated to be that the approved (i.e. One according to Sunnah method
	for the one who has pronounced divorces during menstruation, but has
	not pronounced a triple divorce, is that he should take his wife
	back, and should refrain from pronouncing divorce in the following
	period of purity, but should pronounce it, if he so likes, in the
	period of purity when the wife has become fret from her next
	menstrual course and attained purity, so that his revocation of the
	divorce pronounced during menstruation is not taken in jest. The
	Hanbali viewpoint as presented in Al-Insaf is that in this state it
	is preferable for the pronounce of divorce to take his wife back.
	But Imam Malik and his companions say that pronouncement of divorce
	during menstruation is a cognizable offense. Whether the woman makes
	a demand or not, it is in any case the duty of the ruler that if
	such an act of some one is brought to his notice, he must compel the
	person to take his wife back and should continue to press him till
	the end of the waiting-period; and if he refuses to take her back.
	he should imprison him; if he still refuses, he should beat him; and
	if he still does not accede, the ruler should give his own decision,
	saying: &quot;I return your wife to you. &quot; And the ruler's this
	decision would be effective after which it would be lawful for the
	man to have sexual intercourse with the woman, whether he intends to
	take her back or not, for the ruler's intention represents his
	intention. (Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi). The Malikis also say that if the
	person, who has taken his wife back willingly or unwillingly, after
	divorcing her during menstruation, has made up his mind to repudiate
	her, the preferable method for him is that he should refrain from
	divorcing her in the period of purity following the menstruation
	during which he divorced her, but should divorce her in the period
	of purity following the next menstruation The prohibition to
	pronounce divorce in the period of purity following the menstruation
	in which divorce was pronounced, has been enjoined so that the
	return of the pronouncer during menstruation does not remain merely
	oral, but he should have sexual intercourse with the woman during
	the period of purity. Then, since the pronouncement of divorce in
	the period of purity in which sexual intercourse has taken place is
	prohibited, the right time for pronouncing it is the following
	period of purity only. (Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi). </FONT></FONT>

	As to the question: Till when has the pronouncer of one revocable
	divorce the power to take his wife back? difference of opinion has
	arisen among the jurists and this difference has occurred on the
	question: What do the words thalathata quti'-in or AI-Baqarah: 228
	imply: three menstruation or three periods of purity? According to
	Imam Shafe`i and Malik, qara implies a period of purity, and this
	view is held on the authority of Hadrat 'A'ishah, Ibn 'Umar and Zaid
	bin Thabit (may Allah be pleased with them). The Hanafi viewpoint is
	that qara implies menstruation and the same is the authentic
	viewpoint of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal too. This view is based on the
	authority of all the four rightly-guided Caliphs, Abdullah bin
	Mas'ud, `Abdullah bin 'Abbas, Ubayy bin Ka'b, Mu'adh bin Jabal, Abu
	ad-Darda', 'Ubadah bin as-Samit and Abu Musa al-Ash'ari (may Allah
	be pleased with them). Imam Muhammad in his Mu'watta has cited a
	saying of Sha`bi, saying that he met thirteen of the Holy Prophet's
	Companions and they all held this same opinion, and this very view
	was adopted by many of the immediate followers of the Companions
	also. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On
	account of this difference of opinion, according to the Shafe`is and
	the Malikis, the waiting period of the woman comes to an end as soon
	as she enters the third menstruation, and the man's power to take
	her back -is terminated. And if the divorce has been pronounced
	during menstruation, this menstruation will not be counted towards
	the waiting-period but the waiting-period will come to an end as
	soon as the woman enters the fourth menstruation. (Mughni al-Muhtaj;
	Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi). The Hanafi; viewpoint is that if the menstrual
	discharge in the third menstruation stops after ten days, the
	waiting-period of the woman will cane to an end with it whether she
	takes purification bath or not; and if the discharge ceases within
	less than ten days, the waiting-period will not come to an end until
	the woman has taken her purification bath, or until a Prayer time
	has passed. In case water is not available, according to Imam Abu
	Hanifah and Imam Abu Yusuf, the man's right to return to her will be
	terminated, when she has performed her Prayer with tayammum
	(purification with dust), and, according to Imam Muhammad, as soon
	as she has performed tayammwn itself. (Hedayah). Imam Ahmad's
	authentic viewpoint which is held by the majority of the Hanbalis is
	that as long as the woman does not have her purification bath after
	the third menstruation, the man's right to return to her will
	remain. (Al-Insaf). </FONT></FONT>

	As for the question that is the method of taking the wife back? the
	jurists are agreed that the person, who has pronounced a revocable
	divorce on his wife, can return to her whenever he likes before the
	expiration of the waiting-period, whether the woman is desirous of
	this or not, for the Qur'an says: &quot;Their husbands are best
	entitled to take them back as their wives during this
	waiting-period.&quot; (AI-Baqarah: 228). From this it can
	automatically be concluded that until the expiry of the
	waiting-period, the marriage tie remains intact and the husbands can
	take them back before they are separated absolutely and finally In
	other words, taking the wife back does not mean renewal of marriage
	for which the woman's consent may be necessary. After being

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>According
	to the Shafe'is, return can take place only by the oral word, not by

	performed with the intention of resuming marital relationship, will
	be considered resumption of the relationship. Rather in this case

	by itself amount to resumption whether there was the intention of

	As for the consequences of talaq as-Sunnah (regular form of divorce
	according to the Sunnah) and ,talaq al-bid i (irregular form of
	divorce) the difference is this: In case one or two divorces have
	been pronounced, the divorced woman and her former husband can
	re-marry by mutual consent even if the waiting-period has expired.
	But if a man has pronounced three divorces, resumption of marital
	relation is neither possible within the waiting-period, nor after
	the expiry of the waiting period, unless, however, the woman marries
	another person, the marriage is duly contracted and consummated, and
	then either the second husband divorces her or dies; then if the
	woman and her former husband wish to re-marry by mutual consent,
	they can do so. In most collections of the AhadIth a tradition has
	been reported on sound authority, saying that the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be Allah's peace) was asked: &quot;A man pronounced three
	divorces on his wife, then the woman married another man and the two
	had privacy but there was no intercourse; then he divorced her. Now,
	can this woman re-marry her former husband? The Holy Prophet
	replied: &quot;No, unless her second husband has enjoyed her just as
	her first husband had enjoyed her.&quot; As for the pre-arranged
	marriage (tahlil) which is meant to legalize the woman for her
	former husband, so that she would marry another man, who would
	divorce her after having had sexual intercourse with her, this is
	invalid according to Imam Abu Yusuf, and according to Imam Abu
	Hanifah, the woman would become lawful for her former husband by
	this ceremony but such a thing is reprehensible to the extent of
	being unlawful. Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud has reported that the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) said: &quot;AIIah has
	cursed both the legaliser (Muhallil) and the one for whom
	legalization is performed (mnhallil lahu). &quot;(Tirmidhi, Nasa'i)
	Hadrat 'Uqbah bin 'Amir says that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) asked his Companions: &quot;Should I not tell you as
	to who is a hired bull?&quot; The Companions said that he should. He
	said: &quot;It is he who performs tahlil (legalization of marriage)
	Allah's curse falls both on the muhalil (legalizer) and on the
	muhallal lahu (the one for whose sake marriage is legalized).&quot;

	accurately, to avoid turning the wife out of the house, to take the
	wife back if one decides to keep her, at the expiry of the
	waiting-period with the intention of keeping her equitably and to
	send her away in a fair manner if one decides to part with her, and
	to call two just men to witness the divorce, reconciliation or
	separation, as the case be. In respect of this, Allah says that
	whoever acts in fear of Him, He will open for him a way out of the
	difficulties This automatically gives the meaning That whoever does

	complications and difficulties from which he will find no way out.

	during the same period of purity as a single divorce, is not
	correct. For if an irregular form of divorce does not take place at
	all, it does not create any complication from which one may have to
	find a way out; and if only a single divorce takes place when one
	has pronounced three divorces at once, then also there arises no

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin Mas'ud says that this verse of Surrah At-Talaq was
	sent down after the verse of Surah Al-Baqarah; therefore, the later
	injunction has made the earlier injunction particularly applicable
	to the non pregnant widow, and has laid down the waiting-period of
	every pregnant woman as till child birth, whether she is divorced or
	widowed, Accordingly, whether delivery takes place immediately after
	the husband's death, or takes longer than four months and ten days,
	the woman's waiting-period in any case will come to an end at the
	birth of the child. This view is supported by this tradition of
	Hadrat Ubayy bin Ka'b. He says, &quot;When this verse of Surah At
	Talaq came down, I asked the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah 's
	peace): Is it both for the divorced woman and for the widow?&quot;
	The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;Yes.&quot; In another tradition the
	Holy Prophet further explained it thus: &quot;The waiting period of
	every pregnant woman is till child-birth.&quot; (Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abu
	Hatim. Ibn Hajar says that although its reliability is questionable,
	yet as it has been related through several chains of transmitters,
	one has to admit that it has some basis). More than that, it is
	further confirmed by the incident concerning Subai'ah-i Aslamiyyah
	which occurred in the sacred time of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) himself. She became a widow during her pregnancy and
	a few days after her husband's death (according to some traditions
	20 days, according to others 23 days. 25 days, 40 days or 35 days)
	she delivered her burden. The Holy Prophet was asked for his ruling
	concerning her and Ire permitted her to re-marry. This incident has
	been related by Bukhari and Muslim in different ways on the
	authority of Hadrat Umm Salamah. This same incident has been related
	by Bukhari Muslim, Imam Ahmed Abu Da'ud, Nasa`i and Ibn Majah with
	different chains of transmitters on the authority of Hadrat Miswar
	bin Makhramah also. Muslim has cited this statement of Subai'ah-i
	Aslamiyyah herself: 'I was the wife of Hadrat Sa'd bin Khawalah. He
	died during the Farewell Pilgrimage when I was pregnant. A few days
	after his death I gave birth to a child. A man told me that I could
	not remarry before the expiry of four months and ten days. I went
	and asked the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) and he gave
	the verdict: You have become lawful as soon as you gave birth to the
	child: you can re-marry if you so like'.&quot; This tradition has
	been related briefly by Bukhari also.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This same
	viewpoint has been reported from a large number of the Companions.
	Imam Malik, Imam Shafe'i, 'Abdur Razzaq, Ibn Abi Shaibah and Ibn
	al-Mundhir have related that when Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar was
	asked concerning the pregnant widow, he replied that her
	waiting-period is till childbirth. At this a man from among the
	Ansar confirmed, saying: &quot;Hadrat `Umar had said that even if
	the deceased husband had not yet been buried,and his body still lay
	on bed in the house and his wife gave birth to a child, she would
	become pure and lawful for remarriage.&quot; The same opinion was
	held by Hadrat Abu Hurairah, Hadrat Abu Mansur Badri and Hadrat
	`A'ishah, and the same has been adopted by the four Sunni Imams and
	the other early jurists.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Shafe`is say that if the pregnant woman has more children than one
	in her womb, her waiting-period will come to an end at the birth of
	the last child; even if it is still born, the waiting-period will
	expire at its birth. In case of abortion, if the mid-wives, on the
	basis of their knowledge and experience, state that it was not
	merely a piece of flesh but had human form, or that it was not a
	tumor but a human embryo, their statement will be admitted and the
	waiting period will expire. (Mughni, al-Muhtaj). The viewpoint of
	the Hanbalis and the Hanafis is also very close to it. But in case
	of abortion, their viewpoint is that unless the human form is
	clearly visible, the mid-wives' statement that it is human embryo,
	will not be admitted and this will not bring the waiting-period to
	an end. (Bade ias-Sane i; AI-Insaf). But in the modem times by means
	of medical investigation it can be easily ascertained whether what
	has been expelled from the womb was actually something of the nature
	of human fetus or a kind of tumor or congealed blood. Therefore,
	whenever it is possible to obtain expert medical opinion, it can be
	easily decided whether what is described as abortion, was really
	abortion or not, and whether it has brought the waiting-period to an
	end or not. However, in cases when such medical investigation is not
	possible, the viewpoint of the Hanbalis and the Hanafis itself is
	preferable and it is not fit to rely on the ignorant mid-wives.&nbsp;

	whether she has been divorced revocable or irrevocably. However, the
	difference of opinion has arisen about whether the non-pregnant
	woman who has been divorced irrevocably is entitled to both lodging
	and maintenance, or only to lodging, or to neither. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One group
	says that she is entitled to both lodging and maintenance. This is
	the opinion of Hadrat 'Umar, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Hadrat
	'Ali bin Husain (Imam Zain al-'Abidin), Qadi Shuraih and Ibrahim
	Nakha'i. The same has been adopted by the Hanafis, and the same also
	is the viewpoint of Imam Sufyan Thauri and Hasan bin Saleh. This is
	supported by the Hadith of Daraqutni in which Hadrat 'Abdullah bin
	Jabir reports that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: 'The
	woman who has been divorced thrice has a right to lodging and
	maintenance during the waiting-period. &quot; This is further
	supported by those traditions in which it has been reported that
	Hadrat 'Umar had rejected the Hadith of Fatimah bint-Qais, saying:
	We cannot abandon the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of our Prophet on
	the word of a woman. &quot; This shows that the Sunnah of the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) in the knowledge of Hadrat
	'Umar must be that such a woman is entitled to both maintenance and
	lodging. Furthermore in a tradition from Ibrahim Nakha'i there is
	the explanation that Hadrat Umar rejecting the Hadith of Fatimah
	bint-Qais, had said: &quot;I have heard the Holy Prophet (upon whom
	be Allah's peace) say that such a woman has a right to lodging as
	well as to maintenance.&quot; The first argument that Imam Abu Bakr
	al Jassas has given in his discussion of this question in his Ahkam
	al-Qur an is that Allah has explicitly said: &quot;Divorce them for
	their prescribed waiting periods.&quot; This Divine Command also
	applies to that person who might have taken his wife back after
	divorcing her twice in the first instance, and no v he is left with
	only one divorce to pronounce.&quot; His second argument is: &quot;When
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) taught this method of
	pronouncing divorce that one should either pronounce divorce in such
	a period of purity in which one may not have had sexual intercourse,
	or in a state when the signs of a woman's being pregnant might have
	appeared. In this he did not make any distinction between the first,
	second, or final divorce. Therefore, the Divine (Command, '`Lodge
	them (in the waiting period) where you yourselves live,&quot; will
	be regarded as relevant to every form of divorce.&quot; His third
	argument is; &quot;The maintenance and lodging of the pregnant
	woman, whether divorced revocable or irrevocably, is binding on the
	husband, and in respective the non-pregnant revocably divorced woman
	also both these rights are binding.&quot; This shows that the
	maintenance and lodging have not been made incumbent on the basis of
	pregnancy but because both are legally bound to stay in the
	husband's house. Now, if the same injunction be applicable to the
	irrevocably divorced non-pregnant woman also, there can be no reason
	why her lodging and maintenance should not be incumbent on the man
	divorcing her. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second group says that the irrevocably divorce woman has a right to
	lodging but not to maintenance. This is the viewpoint of Sa'id bin
	al-Musayyab, Suleman bin Yasar, 'Ata`, Sha`bi, Auza'i, Laith and Abu
	'Ubaid (may Allha bless them ), and Imam Shafe' i and Imam Malik
	also have adopted the same. But in Mughni al-Muhtaj a different
	viewpoint of Imam Shafe`i has been stated as will be explained
	below. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	group say that the irrevocably divorced woman is neither entitled to
	lodging nor to maintenance. This is the viewpoint of Hasan Basri,
	Hammad Ibn Laila, 'Amr bin Dinar, Ta'us, Ishaq bin Rahawaih and Abu
	Thaw. Ibn Jarir has cited this very viewpoint as of Hadrat Ibn,
	Abbas, Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal and the Imamiah sect of the Shi'as also
	have adopted the same, and in Mughni al-Muhtaj the viewpoint of the
	Shafe`is also has been stated to be this: 'The woman who is passing
	her waiting-period on the basis of divorce has an obligatory right
	to lodging, whether she is pregnant or not, but for the woman who
	has been irrevocably divorced, it is not obligatory. And for the
	non-pregnant irrevocably divorced woman there is neither maintenance
	nor clothing.&quot; This viewpoint in the first place is based on
	this verse of the Qur'an: &quot;You do not know: Allah may after
	this bring about a situation (of reconciliation).&quot; .From this
	they conclude that this could be correct only about a revocably
	divorced woman, and not about an irrevocably divorced one.
	Therefore, the Command of lodging the divorced woman in the house is
	specifically applicable only to the revocably divorced woman. Their
	second reasoning is from the Hadith of Fatimah bint-Qais, which has
	been reported in the collections of Hadith through many authentic
	channels.

	Fatimah bint-Qais al-Fihriyyah was one of the earliest Emigrants.
	She was esteemed for her wisdom and sagacity, and the consultative
	body of the Companions on the occasion of Hadrat 'Umar's martyrdom
	had met together at her house. She was first married. to Abu `Amr
	bin Hafs bin al-Mughirah al-Makhzumi after she was separated by him
	by three divorces, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace )
	married her to Hadrat Usamah bin Zaid. According to reports, her
	husband, Abu `Amr had pronounced two divorces on her. Then, when he
	was sent to Yemen along with Hadrat 'Ali, he also sent from there
	the third and final divorce, According to lodge her in the house
	during the waiting-period and maintain her, according to others, she
	herself had laid claim to maintenance and lodging. Whatever be the
	case, the husband's relatives refused to concede her claim.
	Thereupon she took her case to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace), and he gave the decision that she was neither entitled to
	maintenance nor to lodging, According to a tradition, the Holy
	Prophet said: &quot;The husband is under obligation to provide
	maintenance and lodging to the woman only in case he had a right to
	return to her, but when he had no such right, she was neither
	entitled to maintenance nor to lodging.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad),
	Tabarani and Nasa'i also have related almost the same tradition, the
	concluding words of which are to the effect: &quot;But when she is
	not lawful for him until she marries another man than him, there is
	neither maintenance for her nor lodging.&quot; After giving this
	decision the Holy Prophet first commanded her to pass her waiting
	period in the house of Umm Sharik and then told her to stay in the
	house of Ibn Umm Muktum.

	by reporting her Hadith has misguided the people. The truth is that

	Ishaq says: &quot;I was sitting with Aswad bin Yazid in the mosque
	of Kufah, when Sha'bi made mention of the Hadith of Fatimah
	bint-Qais. Hadrat Aswad thereupon threw pebbles at Sha'bi and said:
	&quot;When in the time of Hadrat 'Umar this tradition of Fatimah was
	brought to his nonce, he said: 'We cannot cast off the Book of our
	Lord and the Sunnha of our Prophet on the strength of the tradition
	of a woman. Maybe she has forgotten. The woman has a right to
	maintenance as well as to lodging, for Allah says: 'Do not turn them
	out of their houses'.&quot; This tradition has been reported in
	Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi and Nasa'i with some variation in
	wording. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly,
	during the reign of Marwan when a dispute arose in respect of the
	irrevocably divorced woman, Hadrat 'A'ishah had subjected the
	tradition of Fatimah bint-Qais to severe criticism. Qasim bin
	Muhammad says: &quot;I asked Hadrat 'A'ishah: 'Don't you know the
	incident concerning Fatimah?' She replied: 'Better not mention the
	Hadith of Fatimah'.&quot; (Bukhari), The words of Hadrat 'A'ishah in
	the other tradition related by Bukhari are to the effect: &quot;What
	has happened to Fatimah? Is she not afraid of God?&quot; In the
	third tradition Hadrat 'Urwah bin Zubair says that Hadrat `A'ishah
	said: &quot;There is no good for Fatimah in reporting this hadith.&quot;
	In still another tradition Hadrat 'Urwah says that Hadrat 'A'ishah
	expressed great indignation against Fatimah and said: &quot;She in
	fact was in an empty house, where she had no sympathizer; therefore,
	for the sake of her convenience the Holy Prophet instructed her to
	change her house 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Fourthly,
	this lady was later married to Usamah bin Zaid, and Muhammad bin
	Usamah says: &quot;Whenever Fatimah made mention of this Hadith, my
	father would throw at her whatever fell in his hand. &quot;
	(AI-Jassas). Obviously, had not Hadrat Usamah known that the Sunnah
	was contrary to what Fatimah said, he could not have felt so annoyed
	at the mention of this Hadith. &quot;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote17sym" HREF="#sdfootnote17anc">17</A>There
	is complete consensus that whether the woman has been divorced
	revocably or irrevocably, her husband is responsible for her lodging
	and maintenance till child-birth if she is pregnant. However, a
	difference of opinion has arisen in case the husband of the pregnant
	woman may have died, irrespective of whether he may have died alter
	pronouncing the divorce, or May not have pronounced any divorce and
	the woman may have been widowed during pregnancy this regard, the
	jurists have expressed the following views: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Hadrat 'Ali and Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud hold that she has an
	obligatory , right to maintenance in the husband's un-divided
	legacy. The same also has been cited as the view of Hadrat 'Abdullah
	bin 'Umar, Qadi Shuraih, Abul 'Aliyah, Sha'bi and Ibrahim Nakha'i,
	and a saying of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also supports the same.
	(Alusi, AI-Jassas). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) Ibn
	Jarir has cited another view of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas to the
	effect: &quot;If the deceased person has left some inheritance,
	expenditure should be made on her from the share of the child of her
	womb; and if he has left no inheritance, the heirs of the deceased
	should spend on her, for Allah says: 'And the same responsibility
	for the maintenance of the mother devolves upon the heir'.&quot;
	(AI-Baqarah: 233). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
	Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Zubair, Hadrat
	Hasan Basri, Hadrat Sa'id bin al-Musayyab and Hadrat 'Ata' bin Abi
	Abi Rabah say that there is no maintenance for her in the
	inheritance of the deceased husband. A third saying from Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also has been cited to be the same. (AI-Jassas)
	This means that she can meet her expenses from the share of
	inheritance that she may receive from the husband's legacy, but she
	has no right of inheritance on the husband's combined legacy, which
	may burden the other heirs. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) Ibn
	Abi Laila says: &quot;Her maintenance in the deceased husband's
	legacy is as obligatory as is somebody's debt obligatory In his
	legacy. &quot; (AI-Jassas ). That ii, just as a debt has to be paid
	out of a combined legacy, so also should her maintenance be paid out
	of it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) Imam
	Abu Hanifah, Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad and Imam Zufar say: &quot;She
	has neither any right to lodging in the deceased husband's legacy
	nor to maintenance, for nothing belongs to the deceased after death:
	whatever remains after him belongs to the heirs. The widowed
	pregnant woman, therefore, cannot have any maintenance in their
	property.&quot; (Hedayah; AI-Jassas). The same is the viewpoint of
	Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (Al-Insaf )</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) Imam
	Shafe`i says: &quot;There is no maintenance for her; but she has a
	right to lodging (Mughni al-Muhtaj) &quot; His reasoning is based on
	the incident concerning Furai'ah bint-Malik, sister of Hadrat Abu
	Sa`id Khudri: when her husband was put to death, the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be Allah's peace) commanded her to pass her
	waiting-period in the house of her husband. (Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i,
	Timtidhi). Furthermore, they deduce their view from the tradition of
	Daraqutni: &quot;The Holy Prophet said: there is no maintenance for
	the widowed pregnant woman.&quot; The same is the view of Imam Malik
	also. (Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi)&nbsp;

	she has the option to suckle it or not, However, if the child does
	not take to the new nurse-maid, the mother will be compelled to
	suckle it.&quot; A similar opinion is held by Qatadah, Ibrahim
	Nakha`i and Sufyan Thauri. ibrahim Nakha`i adds: &quot;In case
	another woman is not available for nursing the child, the mother
	will be compelled to nurse it. (Ibn Jarir). According to Hedayah:
	&quot;If at the separation of the parents the child has not yet been
	weaned, it is not obligatory that the mother alone should suckle it.
	However, if another woman is not available, the mother would be
	compelled to suckle the child. And if the father says: I shall
	employ another woman to suckle the child on wages instead of having
	it suckled by the mother on wages, and if the mother demands the
	same wages as the other woman, or is Willing to perform the service
	gratis, the mother's right will be regarded as superior. And if the

	warned to the effect: &quot;If you demand too high a wage only in

	their like&rdquo; does not mean that He created as many earths as
	the heavens, but it means that He has also created several earths as
	He has created several heavens. &quot;Of the earth- mean that just
	as this earth which is inhabited by man is serving as bed and cradle
	for the creatures living on it, so has Allah made and set other
	earths also in the universe, which serve as beds and cradles for the
	creatures living on them. Moreover, there arc clear pointers in the
	Qur'an to the effect that living creatures are not found only on the
	earth but also in the heavens. (For instance, see .Ash-Shura: 29 and
	E.N. SO on it). In other words! the countless stars and planets seen
	in the sky are not all lying desolate, but like the earth there are
	many among them which are inhabited. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">From
	among the earliest commentators Ibn 'Abbas is the one, who had
	expressed this truth in the period when man was not even prepared to
	imagine that in the universe there are other habitats also, apart
	from the earth, where rational creatures live. Even the scientists
	of today are yet in doubt about this being a reality, nothing to say
	of the people living 1500 years ago, That is why Ibn 'Abbas felt
	hesitant about whether he should say such a thing before the common
	people are not, because he feared it might affect their 'faith.
	Mujahid says that when he was asked the meaning of this verse, he
	said: &quot;If I give you the commentary of this verse, you will
	turn disbelievers, and your disbelief will be that you will deny
	it.&quot; Almost the same thing has been related from Sa'id bin
	Jubair, saying; 'Ibn 'Abbas said: what can be the guarantee that if
	I tell you its meaning, you would not turn disbelievers?&quot; (lbn
	Jarir, 'Abd bin Humaid). However, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim, Hakim
	and Baihaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman and Kitab al-Asma' was Sifat have
	cited, on the authority of Abud-Doha, this 'commentary from Ibn
	'Abbas in different words: &quot;In each of those earths there is a
	Prophet like your Prophet, an Adam like your Adam, a Noah like your
	Noah, an Abraham like your Abraham, and a Jesus like your Jesus.&quot;
	This tradition has been related by Ibn Hajar in Fath al-Bat and by
	Ibn Kathir in his Commentary, and Imam Dhahbi says: &quot;It has
	been reported authentically, but in my knowledge none apart from
	Abud-Doha has related it; therefore, it is an uncommon and rare
	tradition.&quot; Some other scholars regard it as a falsehood and
	Mulla 'AIi; Qari, in his Maudu at Kabir (p. 19), has described it as
	a fabrication, and written: `Even if it is a tradition from Ibn
	'Abbas, it is based on Israelite traditions.&quot; But the truth is
	that the actual reason why the people have rejected it is their
	regarding it as remote from reason and beyond understanding;
	otherwise there is nothing in it which may by itself be opposed to
	reason. Thus, 'Allama Alusi in his discussion of it in his
	commentary writes: &quot;There is neither any intellectual barrier
	to taking it as correct nor religious. It only means that in every
	earth there is a creation which turns to its origin just as mankind
	in our earth turns to Adam (peace be upon him). and in every earth
	there are individuals, who are distinguished among others just as
	the Prophets Noah and Abraham (peace be upon them) are distinguished
	among us. &quot; A little below the 'Allama writes: &quot;The earths
	may be more than seven, and likewise the heavens also may not be
	only seven. To rest content with the number seven, which is an
	indivisible integer, does not necessarily negate the higher
	numbers.&quot; Then, about the distances between one heaven and
	another, which have been stated as five hundred years or so in some
	Ahadith. the 'Allama says: &quot;This is not meant to give the exact
	measurement of the distances, but to express the truth in a manner
	easily comprehensible to the people.&quot;</P>
