<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Its
theme is to acquaint man with the value, worth and importance of the
Quran. Its being placed just after Surah Al-Alaq in the arrangement
of the Quran by itself explains that the Holy Book, the revelation of
which began with the first five verses of Surah Al-Alaq. was sent
down in a destiny making night. It is a glorious Book and its
revelation for mankind is full of blessings. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At
the outset, Allah says: &quot;We have sent it down.&quot; That is, it
is not a composition of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
blessing) himself, but We Ourself have revealed it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
it is said that &quot;We sent it down in the Night of Destiny.&quot;
Night of Destiny lies two meanings and both are implied here. First,
that it is the night during which destinies are decided; or, in other
words, it is not an ordinary night like the other nights, but a night
in which destinies are made or marred. The revelation of this Book in
this night is not merely the revelation of a book but an event which
will change the destiny of not only the Quraish, or of Arabia, but
of, the entire world. The same thing has been said in Surah Ad-Dukhan
for which please see Introduction to that Surah and E. N. 3 thereof.
The other meaning is that this is, a night of unique honor, dignity
and glory; so much so that it is better than a thousand months. Thus,
the disbelievers of Makkah have been warned, as if to say: &quot;You
on account of your ignorance regard this Book, which Muhammad (upon
whom be Allah's peace and blessings) has presented, as a calamity for
yourselves and complain that a disaster has befallen you, whereas the
night in which it was decreed to be sent down was such a blessed
night that a task was accomplished in it for the well being of
mankind, which had never been accomplished even during a thousand
months of history. This also has been said in verse 3 of Ad-Dukhan in
another way, which we have explained in the introduction to that
Surah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

conclusion, it has been stated that in this night the angels and
Gabriel descend with every decree (which in verse 4 of Surah Ad-
Dukhan has been described as arm-hakim: wise decree) by the leave of
their Lord, and it is all peace from evening till morning; that is,
there is no interference of evil in it, for all decrees of Allah are
intended to promote good and not evil. So much so that even if a
decision to destroy a nation is taken, it is taken for the sake of
ultimate good, not evil. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>The
	words in the original are anzalana hu: &quot;We Ourself have sent it
	down&quot;. But although there is no mention of the Qur'an before
	it, the Qur'an is implied, for &quot;sending down&quot; by itself
	points out that the Qur'an is meant. And there are numerous
	instances of this in the Qur'an that if from the context, or the
	style, the antecedent of a pronoun is apparent, the pronoun is used
	even if the antecedent has not been mentioned anywhere before or
	after it. (For explanation, see E.N. 9 of An-Najm). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, it
	has been said: &quot;We have sent down the Qur'an in the Night of
	Destiny&quot;, and in AI-Baqarah: 185, &quot;Ramadan is the month in
	which the Qur'an was sent down. &quot; This shows that the night in
	which the Angel of God had brought down revelation for the first
	time to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be .Allah's Peace) in the Cave
	of Hira, was a night of the month of Ramadan. This night has been
	described as Lailat-ul-qadr here and as Lailat-im-mubarakah in Surah
	Ad-Dukhan: 3 above. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There can
	be two meanings of sending down the Qur'an in this night: first, ,
	that in this night the entire Qur'an was entrusted to the bearers
	.(angels) of Revelation, and then Gabriel (peace be on him)
	continued to reveal its verses and Surahs, from time to time, to the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) during 23 years as the occasion
	and conditions demanded. This meaning has been given by Ibn `Abbas.
	(Ibn Jarir, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Abi Hatim, Hakim, lbn Marduyah,
	Baihaqi). Second, that the revelation of the Qur'an began in this
	night. This is Imam Sha`bi's view, although from him too the other
	view also is related, which is the view of Ibn `Abbas as cited above
	(Ibn Jarir). Anyhow, in both cases, the meaning is the same that the
	revelation of the Qur'an to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be pence)
	began in this very night, and this was the night in which the five
	opening verses of Surah Al-`Alaq were revealed. The fact, however,
	is that Allah did not compose the verses and the Surahs of the
	Qur'an right at the time guidance was needed by the Holy Prophet for
	his message of Islam in respect of an occasion or affair, but even
	before the creation of the universe, in the very beginning, Allah
	had a full plan of the creation of mankind on the earth, of raising
	the Prophets in it, of sending down the Books to the Prophets, of
	raising the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
	blessings) at the end of the line of the Prophets and of sending
	down the Qur'an to him. In the Night of Destiny only the execution
	of the final phase of the plan began. No wonder if at that very time
	the entire Qur'an was entrusted to the bearers of Revelation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	commentators have interpreted qadr to mean destiny ( taqdir) , . i.
	e it is the night in which Allah entrusts the decrees of destiny to
	the angels to be enforced. This is supported by verse 3 of Surah
	Ad-Dukhan: &quot;This is a night in which every matter is decided
	wisely by Our command.&quot; On the contrary, Imam Zuhri says that
	qadr means glory and honor, there by implying that it is a Night of
	Destiny. This meaning is supported by the words &quot;Lallat-ul-qadr
	is better than a thousand months&quot; of this Surah itself. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the question as to which night it was, it is disputed and there are
	as many as 40 different views on this subject. however, a great
	majority of scholars hold the opinion that one of the odd nights of
	the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan is Lailat-ul-qadr, and
	among these also most scholars think that it is the 27th night.
	Below we give the authentic Ahadith which have been reported in this
	connection: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to Hadrat Abu Hurairah, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said,
	in connection with Lailat-ul qadr, that it is the 27th night. (Abu
	Da'ud Tayalisi). According to another tradition from Hadrat Abu
	Hurairah, it is the last night of Ramadan. (Musnad Ahmad). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When Zirr
	bin Hubaish asked Hadrat Ubayy bin Ka`b about Lailat-ulqadr, he
	stated on oath, and did not make any exception, that it is the 27th
	night. (Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Ibn Hibban). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When
	Hadrat Abu Zarr was asked about it, he said: &quot;Hadrat `Umar,
	Hadrat Hudhaifah and many other Companions of the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be peace) had no doubt that it is the 271h night.&quot; (Ibn
	Abi Shaibah). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	`Ubadah bin as-Samit says that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	said: `Lailat-al-qadr is one of the odd nights of the last ten
	nights of Ramadan: 21st, 23rd, 25th, 27th, 29th, or the last night.&quot;
	(Musnad Ahmad). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	`Abdullah bin 'Abbas says that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	said: &quot;Search for it among the last ten nights of Ramadan when
	there are still nine days in the month, or seven days, or five
	days.&quot; (bukhari). Most of the scholars have understood it to
	mean that by this the Holy Prophet meant the odd nights. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Abu Bakr said: &quot;When nine days remain in the month, or seven
	days, or five days, or three days, or the last night.&quot; What he
	meant was that Lailat-ul-qadr should be sought among these dates.
	(Tirmidhi, Nasa'i).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to Hadrat 'A'ishah, the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said:
	&quot;Search for lailat-ul- qadr among the odd nights of the last
	ten nights of Ramadan. (Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad, Tirmidhi). Hadrat
	'A'ishah and Hadrat 'Abdullah bin `Umar have also reported that the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) observed i`tikaf (seclusion in the
	Mosque) during the last ten nights of Ramadan every year during his
	lifetime. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On the
	basis of the traditions related in this regard on the authority of a
	great Companions like Hadrat Mu`awiyah, Hadrat lbn 'Umar, Hadrat Ibn
	'Abbas and others, a large number of the earliest scholars regard
	the 27th of Ramadan as Lailat-ul-qadr. Probably Allah and His
	Messenger have not specified any one night for the reason so that
	the people, in their zeal to benefit from the virtues of
	Lailat-ul-qadr, should spend more and more nights in worship and
	devotion and should not remain content with only one night. Here the
	question arises that when it is night at Makkah, it is daytime in a
	large part of the world; therefore, the people of those parts can
	never take advantage of Lailat-ul-qadr. The answer is that the word
	night in Arabic is mostly used for the combination of the day and
	night. Therefore, the night preceding the day on any one of these
	dates of Ramadan can be Lailat ul-qadr for that part of the world.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote2">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>The
	commentators in general have understood this to mean that the good
	acts performed in this Night are superior in value to the good acts
	of a thousand months in which Lailat-ul-qadr is not included. There
	is no doubt that this is in itself correct and the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) has described great excellencies and virtues of
	the good acts and devotions of this Night. According to a tradition
	related in Bukhari and Muslim, on the authority of Hadrat Abu
	Hurairah, the Holy Prophet said: The one who remained standing in
	worship in the state of belief and for the sake of rewards from
	Allah during Lailat-ul-qadr, would have all his previous sins
	forgiven.&quot; And in Musnad Ahmad, there is a tradition from
	Hadrat `Ubadah bin as-Samit, saying that the Holy Prophet said:
	Lailat-ut-qadr is. Among the last ten nights of Ramadan. The one who
	stood up in worship in order to take advantage of their rewards,
	Allah wilt forgive all his former and latter sins.&quot; But, the
	verse does not say: &quot;To act righteously in Lailat-ul-qadr is
	better than acting righteously in a thousand months, &quot; but it
	says: lailat-ul-qadr is better than a thousand months. &quot; And &quot;a
	thousand months&quot; also does not imply 83 years and 4 months
	exactly, but a very long period of time as &quot;a thousand&quot;
	denoted among the Arabs. Therefore, the verse means that in this one
	night a task was accomplished for the welfare of mankind the like of
	which had not been accomplished even during an indefinitely long
	period of history.&nbsp;
