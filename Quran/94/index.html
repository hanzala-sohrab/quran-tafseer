aim and object of this Surah too is to console and encourage the Holy
Messenger (upon whom be Allah's peace). Before his call he never had
to encounter the conditions which he suddenly had to encounter after
it when he embarked on his mission of inviting the people to Islam.
This was by itself a great revolution in his own life of which he had
no idea in his life before Prophethood. No sooner had he started
preaching the message of Islam than the same society which had
esteemed him with unique honor, turned hostile to him. The same
relatives and friends, the same clansmen and neighbors, who used to
treat him with the highest respect, began to shower him with abuse
and invective. No one in Makkah was prepared to listen to him; he
began to be ridiculed and mocked in the street and on the road; and
at every step he had to face new difficulties. Although gradually he
became accustomed to the hardships, even much severer ones, yet the
initial stage was very discouraging for him. That is why first Surah
Ad-Duha was sent down to console him, and then this Surah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>To
	begin the discourse with this question, and then the subsequent
	theme, shows that the Holy Messenger (upon whom be Allah's peace) at
	that time was very disturbed and distressed at the great hardships
	that he was passing through in the initial stage of his mission of
	calling the people to Islam. Under those conditions Allah addressed
	him and consoling him, said: &quot;O Prophet, have We not blessed
	you with such and such favor? Then, why do you feel so disturbed and
	distressed at these initial difficulties?&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A little
	consideration of the context wherever the word sharh sadr (opening
	up of the breast) has occurred in the Qur'an, shows that it has two
	meanings: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) In
	Surah Al-An'am: 125, it was said: &quot;So whomever Allah wills to
	guide aright, He makes his breast wide open to Islam (yashrah
	sadrahu lil-lslam)&quot;; and in Surah Az-Zumar; 22: &quot;Can the
	person whose breast Allah has opened for Islam (sharahallabu sadrahu
	liI-Islam) and he is walking in the light shown by his Lord..&quot;
	At both these places sharh sadr implies to free oneself from every
	kind of distraction and vacillation and to be satisfied with Islam
	as the only right way of life, and to regard the beliefs, principles
	of morality and civilization, religious instructions and
	injunctions, which Islam has given to man, as right and true. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) In
	Surah Ash-Shu`ara': 12-13, it has been mentioned that when Allah
	appointed the Prophet Moses to the great office of Prophethood and
	commanded him to go and confront the Pharaoh and his mighty empire,
	he submitted: &quot;My Lord, I fear that they will treat me as a
	liar, and my breast straitens.&quot; And in Surah Ta Ha: 2526, it
	has been stated that on this very occasion the Prophet Moses
	implored Allah, saying: &quot;Lord, open up my breast for me
	(Rabbisbrah-li sadri) and make my task easy for me.&quot; Here,
	straitening of the breast implies a person's finding it too hard for
	himself to shoulder the onerous responsibilities of Prophethood and
	going out to clash with a mighty and tyrannical power of disbelief
	all by himself, and sharh sadr implies that his morale be boosted so
	that he is ready to undertake any campaign and any task however
	difficult and hard, without any hesitation, and he develops the
	nerve and courage to shoulder the great responsibilities of
	Prophethood. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A little
	consideration will show that in this verse &quot;opening up of the
	Holy Prophet's breast&quot; contains both these meanings. According
	to the first meaning, it implied that before the Prophethood the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) looked upon the religion of the
	polytheistic Arabs, Christians, Jews and fire worshipers as false,
	and was not even satisfied with the hanifiyyat prevalent among some
	of the Arab monotheists, for it was an ambiguous creed which
	contained no detail of the right way. (This we have explained in
	E.N.'s of As Sajdah). But since he himself did not know what was the
	right way, he was mentally confused and distracted. With the
	blessing of Prophethood Allah removed his mental agitation and
	opened up before him the way of right guidance, which brought him
	full peace of mind. According to the second meaning, it implies that
	along with the blessing of Prophethood Allah also blessed him with
	the courage, spirit ,of resolution and broad mindedness which were
	needed for shouldering the onerous responsibilities of the great
	office. He became bearer of the vast knowledge, which no other human
	mind could encompass and contain. He was blessed with the wisdom
	which could rectify any evil however grave and wide spread. He
	developed the capability to stand up without any equipment and the
	apparent help and support of a worldly power as the standard-bearer
	of Islam in a society sunk in ignorance and barbarism, to brave any
	storm of hostility without the least hesitation, to endure patiently
	all the difficulties and hardships of the way 'so that no power
	might cause him to abandon his position and standpoint. Thus, The
	verse means to impress the point: &quot;When Allah has blessed you,
	O Prophet, with this invaluable wealth of sharh sadr, why do you
	feel distressed and depressed at the hardships you are experiencing
	in the initial stage of your mission.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	commentators have taken sharh sadr to mean shaqq Sadr (splitting up
	of the breast) and have declared this verse to be a proof of the
	miracle of sharh sadr as related in the traditions of the Hadith.
	But the fact is that the proof of that miracle is dependent only on
	the traditions of the Hadith, it is not correct to prove it from the
	Qur'an. According to the Arabic language, sharh sadr can in no way
	be taken to mean shaqq sadr. `Allama Alusi in the Ruh al-Ma'ani
	says:&quot;In the sight of the research scholars it is a weak thing
	to regard sharh sadr as shaqq sadr. &quot;&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote2">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>Some
	of the commentators have interpreted this to mean that before
	Prophethood, in the days of ignorance, the Holy Prophet (upon whom
	be peace) had happened to commit certain errors because of which he
	was feeling disturbed, and Allah by sending down this verse consoled
	and satisfied him, saying that He had forgiven him those errors. But
	in our opinion it is a grave mistake to interpret this verse thus.
	In the first place, the word vizr does not necessarily mean a sin,
	but it is also used for a heavy burden. Therefore, there is no
	reason why it should in every case be taken in the bad sense.
	Secondly, the Holy Prophet's life before Prophethood also was so
	clean and pure that it had been presented in the Qur'an as a
	challenge before the opponents.. So much so that the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) was made to point out to the disbelievers: &quot;I
	have already lived a lifetime among you before the revelation of
	this Qur'an.&quot; (Yunus 16). and he was also not the type of a
	person who would commit a sift secretly. God forbid, had he been
	such a man, Allah would not have been unaware of it, and would not
	have made him proclaim the thing before the people openly, which He
	made him proclaim in the above-mentioned verse of Sarah Yunus, if
	his person carried the blot of a sin committed secretly. Thus, in
	fact, in this verse vizr means a heavy burden and it implies the
	burden of distress, anguish and anxiety that was, telling on his
	sensitive nature when he saw- his nation deeply sunk in ignorance
	and barbarism. Idols were being worshiped, the community was
	engrossed in idolatry and polytheistic customs and practices, filth
	of immorality and indecency prevailed all around, wickedness and
	corrupt practices were rampant in society, the powerful were
	suppressing the powerless; girls were being-buried alive, tribes
	were subjecting, one another to surprise attacks, and sometimes the
	wars of vengeance continued for a hundred years at a stretch. No
	one's life, property and honor was safe unless he had a strong hand
	at his back. This grieved the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) but
	he could find no way to cure the malady. This same anxiety was
	weighing down his back. Allah by showing him the way to Guidance
	removed its burden from him. Then as soon as he was appointed to the
	office of Prophethood, . he came to know that belief in the doctrine
	of Tauhid, the Hereafter and Prophethood was the master-key by which
	each corruption in human life could be eradicated and the way to
	reform opened in every aspect of life. This guidance front Allah
	relieved him of his burden and he felt re-assured that by means of
	it he would not only be able to cure the maladies of Arabia but also
	of all mankind outside Arabia as well.&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote3">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote3sym" HREF="#sdfootnote3anc">3</A>This
	was said at a time when no one could even conceive how the renown of
	the one unique individual who had only a few followers confined only
	to the city of Makkah, would be exalted throughout the world, and
	what high fame he would achieve. But Allah Almighty gave His
	Messenger (upon whom be peace) this good news under those very
	conditions and then fulfilled it in a strange way. In the first
	place, he took from his enemies themselves the task of exalting his
	renown. One of the methods that the disbelievers of Makkah adopted
	to defeat his mission was that in the Hajj season when the pilgrims
	from every corner of Arabia were attracted to their city, they would
	visit them at their halting places and would warn them to beware of
	a dangerous man called Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
	blessings), who they alleged, worked such magic on the people that
	father was separated from son, brother from brother, and husband
	from wife; therefore, they should keep away from him, The same thing
	they said to all other people, who visited Makkah on other than Hajj
	days in connection with pilgrimage or on other business. In this way
	although they were trying to defame the Holy Prophet, yet the result
	was that his name reached every nook and comer of Arabia and the
	enemies themselves. took him out of his seclusion in Makkah and
	introduced him among all the tribes of the country. After this, it
	was but natural that .'the people should become curious to know as
	to who was this man, what he preached, what was his character like
	and who were the people influenced by his magic and what sort of
	effect his &quot;magic&quot; had on them. As the propaganda of the
	Makkan disbelievers spread the people's curiosity also grew. When as
	a result of this curiosity the people came to know of the Holy
	Prophet's morals, his character and conduct, when they heard the
	Qur'an and found what teachings it presented and when the people saw
	how different the lives of those who had been influenced by what was
	being described as .magic had become from the lives of the common
	Arabs, the bad name started being changed into good name. So much so
	that by the time the Hijrah took place there was perhaps no tribe
	left anywhere in Arabia from which one or another person, one or
	another clan had not accepted Islam and in which at least some
	people had not developed sympathy and interest in the Holy Prophet
	and his message. This was the first stage of the exaltation of his
	renown. Then from the Hijrah started the second stage in which on
	the one hand the hypocrites, the Jews and the prominent polytheists
	of Arabia were actively engaged in defaming him and on the other the
	Islamic State of Madinah was presenting such a practical model of
	God-worship, God consciousness, piety and devotion, purity of morals
	and community life, justice and equity, equality of man and man,
	generosity of the rich, care of the poor, fulfillment of pledges and
	promises and righteousness in dealings, which was conquering the
	hearts, The enemies tried by resort to war to impede the growing
	influence of the Holy Prophet, but the party of the believers,
	trained and developed under his own leadership, proved its
	superiority by their discipline, their bravery, their fearlessness
	of death, and their adherence to restrictions of morality even in
	the state of war; so convincingly that entire Arabia had to
	recognize it as a power to be reckoned with. Within ten years the
	Holy Prophet's renown become so exalted that the same land in which
	the opponents had exerted their utmost to defame him, reverberated
	with the slogan of Ash hadu anna Muhammad ar-Rasul Allah from one
	end to the other. Then the third stage commenced with the
	establishment of the righteous Caliphate when his holy name started
	being mentioned and praised everywhere in the world. This process
	continues till today, and will continue till Resurrection if Allah
	so wills. Wherever in the world there exists a settlement of the
	Muslims, the apostleship of Muhammad (Upon whom be Allah's peace) is
	being proclaimed aloud in the call to the Prayer five times a day,
	blessings of Allah are being invoked on him in the Prayers, and his
	sacred remembrance is being made in the Friday Sermons. There is no
	moment in the 12 months of the year and in the 24 hours of the day
	when at one or another place in the world, the Prophet's holy name
	is not being mentioned. This is a clear proof of the truth of the
	Qur'an that when in the initial stage of the Prophet hood Allah
	proclaimed wa rafa `na Iaka dhikrak, no one could estimate and
	imagine with what esteem and to what great extent the Holy Prophet's
	renown would be exalted. In a Hadith Hadrat Abu Sa`id Khudri has
	reported that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) said: &quot;Gabriel
	came to me and said: My Lord and your Lord asks: In what ways have I
	exalted your renown? I submitted: Allah alone has the best.
	knowledge. He said: Allah says: Whenever mention is made of Me, yon
	too will be mentioned along with Me.&quot; (Ibn Jarir, lbn Abi
	Hatim, Musnad Abu Ya`la, Ibn al-Mundhir, Ibn Hibban Ibn Marduyah,
	Abu Nu`aim). The whole later history stands witness that this
	prediction has proved literally true.&nbsp;

	hardship should be accompanied by ease, for these two things do not
	co-exist. But the words &quot;hardship with ease&quot; instead of
