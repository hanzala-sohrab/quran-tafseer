Abbas says: &quot;Hadrat Umar used to invite me to sit in his
assembly along with some of the important elderly Companions who had
fought at Badr. This was not liked by some of them. They complained
that they also had sons who were like the boy. Why then was he in
particular invited to sit in the assembly? (Imam Bukhari and Ibn
Jarir have pointed out that such a thing was said by Hadrat Abdur
Rahman bin Auf). </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hadrat
Umar said that the boy enjoyed the position and distinction because
of his knowledge. Then one day he invited the Companions of Badr and
called me also to sit with them. I understood that he had invited me
to the assembly to prove his contention. During the conversation
Hadrat Umar asked the Companions of Badr: &quot;What do you say about

Some said: &quot;In it we have been enjoined to praise Allah and ask
for His forgiveness when His succor comes and we attain victory.&quot;Some
others said that it implied the conquest of cities and forts. Some
kept quiet. Then Hadrat Umar said: &quot;Ibn Abbas, do you also say
the same?&quot;I said no. He asked: &quot;What then is your view?&quot;I
submitted that it implied the last hour of Allah's Messenger (upon
whom be peace); in it he was informed that when Allah's succor came
and victory was attained, it would be a sign that his hour had come;
therefore, he should praise Allah and ask for His forgiveness.
Thereat Hadrat Umar said &quot;I know naught but what you have said.&quot;</FONT></FONT></SPAN></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
another tradition there is the addition that, Hadrat Umar said to the
Companions: &quot;How can you blame me when you yourselves have seen
why I invite this boy to join the assembly?&quot; (Bukhari, Musnad
Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Marduyah, Baghawi, Baihaqi, Ibn
al-Mundhir). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
is shown by the above traditions, Allah in this Surah had informed
His Messenger (upon whom be peace) that when Islam attained complete
victory in Arabia and the people started entering Allah's religion in
great numbers, it would mean that the mission for which he had been
sent to the world, had been fulfilled. Then, he was enjoined to busy
himself in praising and glorifying Allah by Whose bounty he had been
able to accomplish such a great task, and should implore Him to
forgive whatever failings and frailties he might have shown in the
performance of the service. Here, by a little consideration one can
easily see the great difference that there is between a Prophet and a
common worldly leader. If a worldly leader in his own lifetime is
able to bring about a revolution, which has the aim and objective of
his struggle, this would be an occasion for exultation for him. But
here we witness quite another phenomenon. The Messenger of Allah in a
brief space of 23 years revolutionized an entire nation as regards
its beliefs, thoughts, customs, morals, civilization, ways of living,
economy, politics and fighting ability, and raising it from ignorance
and barbarism enabled it to conquer the world and become leader of
nations; yet when he had accomplished this unique task, he was not
enjoined to celebrate it but to glorify and praise Allah and to pray
for His forgiveness, and he busied himself humbly the implementation
of that command. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	here does not imply victory in any one particular campaign but the
	decisive victory after which there remained no power in the land to
	resist and oppose Islam, and it became evident that Islam alone
	would hold sway in Arabia Some commentators have taken this to imply
	the Conquest of Makkah. But the conquest of Makkah took place iu
	A.H. 8, and this Surah was revealed towards the end of A.H.10, as is
	shown by the traditions related on the authority of Hadrat `Abdullah
	bin `Umar and Hadrat Sarra' bint Nabhan, which we have cited in the
	Introduction. Besides, the statement of Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas
	that this is the last Surah of the Qur'an to be revealed, also goes
	against this commentary. For if the victory implied the conquest of
	Makkah, the whole of Surah at-Taubah was revealed after it then it
	could not be the last Surah. There is no doubt that the conquest of
	Makkah was decisive in that it broke the power of the Arabian
	pagans, yet even after this, they showed clear signs of resistance.
	The battles of Ta'if and Hunain were fought after it, and it took
	Islam about two years to attain complete control over Arabia.&nbsp;

	Islam in one's and two's comes to an end, and when whole tribes and
	people belonging to large tracts start entering it in crowds, of
	their own free will, and without offering battle or resistance.&quot;
	This happened from the beginning of A.H. 9, because of which that
	year has been described as the year of deputations. Deputations from
	every part of Arabia started coming before the Holy Messenger (upon
	whom be peace), entering Islam and taking the oath of allegiance to
	him, until when he went for the Farewell Pilgrimage to Makkah, in
	A.H. 10, the whole of Arabia had become Muslim, and not a single

	implies praising and hallowing Allah Almighty as well as thanking
	and paying obeisance to Him; tasbih means to regard Allah as pure
	and free from every blemish and weakness. The Holy Prophet was
	enjoined to do hamd and tasbih of Allah when he witnessed this
	manifestation of His power. Here, hamd means that in respect of his
	great success he should never entertain even a tinge of the idea
	that it was the result of any excellence of his own, but he should
	attribute it to Allah's favor and mercy, thank Him alone for it, and
	acknowledge with the heart and tongue that praise and gratitude for
	the victory and success belonged to Him alone. And tasbih means that
	he should regard Allah as pure and free from the limitation that
	exaltation of his Word stood in need of his effort and endeavor, or
	was dependent on it. On the contrary, his heart should be filled
	with the faith that the success of his effort and struggle was
	dependent upon Allah's support and succor. He could take this
	service from any of His servants He pleased. and it was His favor
	that He had taken it from him, and made His religion meet success
	through him. Besides, there is an aspect of wonder also in
	pronouncing the tasbih, i.e. Subhan Allah. When a wonderful incident
	takes place, one exclaims subhan-Allah, thereby implying that only
	by Allah's power such a wonderful thing had happened; otherwise no
	power of the world could have caused it to happen.&nbsp;

	of him, and he should implore Allah, saying: &quot;Lord, overlook
	and forgive whatever weakness I might have shown in rendering Your
	right, and accept the little service that I have been able to
	perform.&quot; When such an etiquette was taught to the Holy
	Messenger (upon whom be peace), none in the world conceivably has
	toiled and struggled so hard in the cause of Allah as he did, how
	can another person regard his work as superb and be involved in the
	misunderstanding that he has fulfilled the right Allah had imposed
	on him? Allah's right, in fact, is so supreme that no creature can
	ever fulfill and render it truly and fully.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Allah in
	this command has taught Muslims an eternal lesson: &quot;Do not
	regard any of your worship, devotion or religious service as
	something superb; even if you have expended your entire life in the
	cause of Allah, you should always think that you could not do all
	that was required of you by your Lord. Likewise, when you attain
	some victory, you should not regard it as a result of some
	excellence in yourselves but as a result of only Allah's bounty and
	favor. Then bowing humbly before your Lord, you should praise and
	glorify Him, and should repent and beg for His forgiveness instead
	of boasting and bragging of your success and victory.&quot;
