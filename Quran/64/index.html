and Kalbi say that it was partly revealed at Makkah and partly at
Madinah. Hadrat Abdullah bin Abbas and Ata bin Yasar say that vv.
1-13 were revealed at Makkah and vv. 14-18 at Madinah. But the
majority of commentators regard the whole of the surah as a Madinan
Revelation. Although there is no internal evidence to help determine
its exact period of revelation, yet a study of its subject matter
shows that it might probably have been sent down at an early stage at
Madinah. That is why it partly resembles the Makkah surahs and partly
the Madinan Surahs. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
theme of this surah is invitation to the Faith and obedience (to
Allah) and the teaching of good morals. The sequence followed is that
the first four verses are addressed to all men; verses 5-10 to those
men, who do not believe in the invitation of the Qur'an; and verses
11-18 to those who accept and believe in this invitation. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the verses addressed to all men, they have been made aware in a few
brief sentences of the four fundamental truths: </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First,
that the universe in which they live is not Godless, but its Creator,
Master and Ruler is an All Powerful God, and everything in it
testifies to His being most Perfect and absolutely faultless. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Second,
that the universe is not without purpose and wisdom, but its Creator
has created it with truth no one should be under the delusion that it
is a mock show, which began without a purpose and will come to an end
without a purpose. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Third,
that the excellent form that God has created you with and the choice
that He has given you to choose between belief and unbelief is not a
useless and meaningless activity so that it may be of no consequence
whether you choose belief or unbelief. In fact, God is watching as to
how you exercise your choice. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fourth,
that you have not been created irresponsible and un-answerable. You
have to return ultimately to your Creator, and have to meet the Being
who is aware of everything in the universe, from Whom nothing is
hidden, to Whom even the innermost thoughts of the minds are known. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
stating these four fundamental truths about the Universe and Man, the
address turns to the people who adopted the way of unbelief, and
their attention is drawn to a phenomenon which has persisted
throughout human history, namely that nation after nation has arisen
and ultimately gone to its doom. Man by his intellect and reason has
been explaining this phenomenon in a thousand ways, but Allah tells
the real truth and declares that the fundamental causes of the
destruction of the nations were only two: </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First,
that they refused to believe in the Messengers whom He sent for their
guidance, with the result that Allah too left them to themselves, and
they invented their own philosophies of life and went on groping
their way from one error to another. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Second,
that they also, rejected the doctrine of Hereafter, and thought this
worldly life to be an end in itself, and that there was no life
hereafter when they would have to render an account of their deeds
before God. This corrupted their whole attitude towards life, and
their impure morals and character so polluted the world that
eventually the scourge of God itself had to descend and eliminate
them from the scene. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
stating these two instructive truths of human history, the deniers of
the message of Truth have been admonished to wake up and believe in
Allah, His Messenger and the Light of Guidance that Allah has sent in
the form of the Qur'an if they want to avoid the fate met by the
former peoples. Besides, they have been warned that the Day shall
eventually come when all the former and the latter generations will
be collected at one place and the fraud and embezzlement committed by
each will be exposed before all mankind. Then the fate of each man
will be decided finally on the basis as to who had adopted the path
of the Faith and righteousness and who had followed the way of
disbelief and denial of the Truth. The first group shalt deserve
eternal Paradise and the second shall be doomed to everlasting Hell. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
addressing those who adopt the way of the Faith, a few important
instructions have been given: </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First,
that whatever affliction befalls a person in the world, it befalls
him by Allah's leave. Whoever in this state of affliction remains
steadfast to the Faith, Allah blesses his heart with guidance;
otherwise although the affliction of the one who in confusion or
bewilderment turns away from the path of the Faith, cannot be averted
except by Allah's leave, yet he becomes involved in another, the
greatest affliction of all, namely that his heart is deprived of the
guidance of Allah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Secondly,
that the believer is not required to affirm the faith with the tongue
only, but after the affirmation of the Faith he should practically
obey Allah and His Messenger. If he turns away from obedience he
would himself be responsible for his loss, for the Holy Messenger of
Allah (upon whom be His peace) has become absolved from the
responsibility after having delivered the message of Truth. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thirdly,
that the believer should place his trust in Allah alone and not in
his own power or some other power of the world. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fourthly,
that the worldly goods and children are a great trial and temptation
for the believer, for it is their love which generally distracts man
from the path of faith and obedience. Therefore, the believers have
to beware some of their children, and wives lest they become robbers
for them on the Way of God directly or indirectly; and they should
spend their wealth for the sake of God so that their self remains
safe against the temptations of Satan. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Fifthly,
that every man is responsible only to the extent of his power and
ability. Allah does not demand that man should exert himself beyond
his power and ability. However, the believer should try his best to
live in fear of God as far as possible, and should see that he does
not transgress the bounds set by Allah in his speech, conduct and
dealings through his own negligence. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	explanation, see E.N. I of the commentary on Surah AI-Hadid. A study
	of the following theme by itself shows why the discourse has ban
	begun with this sentence. What has been stated below about the
	Universe and Man is that Allah alone is their Creator, Master,
	Ruler, and He has not made this universe without purpose and wisdom,
	that Man has not been created and left irresponsible, so that he may
	act as he may please, and there should be nobody to call him to
	account, and that the Ruler of this universe is not a care-free and
	ignorant king so that he may have no knowledge of what is happening
	in his kingdom. The best introduction to this theme could be the
	same as has been couched in this brief sentence. In view of the
	context, the introduction means: In whichever direction you may turn
	your gaze, from the earth to the limitless vastnesses of the
	heavens, you will clearly see that everything from a particle to the
	great galaxies not only testifies to the existence of God but also
	bears evidence that its God is free from every defect every weakness
	and error. Had them been the least probability of a defect or fault,
	weakness or deficiency, in His essence and attributes, in His acts
	and decrees, this perfect and wise system could not have come into
	being at all, nor continue to function so consistently and immutably
	from eternity to eternity.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>It
	has four meanings and all arc correct in their respective places: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that &quot;He alone is your Creator, yet some of you deny His being
	the Creator and others acknowledge this truth. &quot; This meaning
	becomes obvious when the first and the second sentences arc read
	together. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second.
	that &quot;He Himself has created you with the nature that if you
	choose to adopt unbelief, you may do so, and if you choose to affirm
	belief, you may do so. He has not compelled you to either accept or
	reject the Faith therefore, you yourselves arc responsible for your
	adopting belief or unbelief.&quot; This meaning is confirmed by the
	following sentence: &quot;Allah sees whatever you do.&quot; That is,
	By giving you this choice He has put you to the test, and He is
	watching how you exercise this choice.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	meaning is. &quot;He had created you with a sound, wholesome nature,
	which demanded that you should all adopt the way of the Faith, yet
	some of you adopted unbelief, which was opposed to the nature and
	purpose of their creation, and some of you adopted the way of the
	Faith, which was in conformity with their nature This theme becomes
	obvious when this verse is read along with verse 30 of Surah Ar-Rum
	which says: &quot;Set your face sincerely and truly towards Faith,
	and be steadfast on the Nature whereupon Allah has created mankind.
	There can be no alteration in the Nature made by Allah. This is the
	right and true Faith.' And this very theme is explained by several
	Ahadith in which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) has
	repeatedly stated that every man has been created on true human
	nature; then polytheism and deviation befall him from outside (For
	futher explanation, see E.N.'s 42 to 47 of the commentary of Surah
	Ar-Rum) Here, it may he pointed out that no Divine Book has ever
	presented the concept of man's being a sinner by birth, which
	Christianity has embraced as its fundamental doctrine for 1,500
	years. Recently even Catholic scholars themselves have started
	expressing the view that there is no basis for this doctrine in the
	Bible. The famous German biblical scholar Rev. Herbert Haag, writes
	in his book, Is Original Sin in Scripture &quot;Among the earliest
	Christians, at least till the 3rd century A.D., there existed no
	such creed that man was a sinner by birth, and when this idea
	started spreading among the people, the Christian scholars continued
	to contradict it for two centuries. At last in the 5th century A.D.
	St Augustine by the power of his logic made this idea a part of the
	fundamental beliefs of Christianity: 'Mankind is heir to the
	original sin committed by Adam, and there is no way to salvation for
	man except through the Atonement made by Christ.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	fourth meaning is: &quot;Only Allah brought you into existence from
	nonexistence: you were not, then you became. This was such a simple
	thing that if you had thought over it seriously and seen that life
	is the actual blessing through which you are benefiting by the other
	blessings in the world, none of you would have adopted the attitude
	of disbelief and rebellion against your Creator. But some of you did
	not give it due thought, or thought wrongly, and adopted the way of
	disbelief, and some others adopted the same way of belief and faith
	which was the very demand of correct thinking.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote6">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote6sym" HREF="#sdfootnote6anc">6</A>In
	this sentence &quot;seeing&quot; does not merely mean to see, but it
	automatically gives the meaning that man will be rewarded or
	punished according to his actions and deeds. It is just like a
	master's taking a person into service and then telling him: &quot;I
	shall sec how you perform your duties,&quot; which implies: &quot;If
	you perform your duties well, I shall reward you fully; otherwise I
	shall call you to account for your negligence.&quot;&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote7">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote7sym" HREF="#sdfootnote7anc">7</A>In
	this verse three things have been stated in their sequence, which
	are well connected logically: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, it
	has been said that Allah has created this universe with the truth.
	When the word &quot;with the truth&quot; is spoken for a news, it
	means a true news; when it is spoken for a command, it means a
	command based on justice; when it is spoken for a statement, it
	means a correct statement; and when it is used for an act, it
	implies an act which is wise, reasonable and useful. Now, khalq (to
	create) is an act; therefore, to say that the universe has been
	created with the truth, would inevitably mean that the universe has
	not been created for fun but it is a serious work of a Wise Creator:
	everything in it has a rational object and purpose, and the element
	of its being purposeful is so evident that if a sensible person
	understands the nature of a thing well, it cannot be difficult for
	him to know the rational and wise purpose for which it has been
	created. All of modern science testifies that whenever man has
	succeeded in understanding the true nature of a thing by careful
	thought, research and investigation, he has also come to know
	eventually the purpose and object of its creation, and this
	understanding of its purpose has led him to countless inventions
	which are now being used in civilized human life. This could not be
	possible, had this universe been the plaything of a carefree person,
	devoid of any wisdom and purpose. (For further explanation, see E.N.
	46 of AIAn-am, E.N. 11 of Yunus, E.N. 26 of Ibrahim, E.N. 46 of
	Ati-Nahl, E.N.'s 15, 16 of Al-Anbiya, E.N. 102 of Al-Mu'nunun, E.N.
	75 of Al-'Ankabut, E.N. 6 of Ar-Rum, E.N. 34 of Ad-Dukhan, B.N. 28
	of AI-Jathiyah). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	it has been said that in this universe Allah has created man in the
	best shape. Shape here does not imply only man's fact but his whole
	bodily structure; it also inclusions all those powers and abilities
	which man has been granted to function in this world. In both these
	aspects man has been given the best shape and form among the
	creatures of the earth, and on the same basis he has become worthy
	to rule over all the universe. He has been given an erect stature he
	has been given most appropriate feet to walk on; he has given most
	suitable hands to work with; he has been given such senses and
	organs to acquire knowledge by which he obtains every kind of
	information; he has been given a powerful mind to think and
	understand and deduce results from the body of acquired information;
	he has been given a moral sense and a power of discrimination by
	which he distinguishes between good and evil, right and wrong; he
	has been given the power of decision by using which he selects his
	own course of action, and decides as to where he should employ his
	efforts and where he should not. He has even been given the freedom
	that he may acknowledge his ('rector and serve Him if he so likes
	and reject Him if he pleases, or may make whomever he likes his
	gods, or rebel even against Him Whom he regards as his God. Along
	with all these capabilities and powers Allah has granted him the
	authority to appropriate everything created by Him, and he is
	practically using this authority in the world. (For further
	explanation, see E.N. 91 of Al-Mu'min). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	thing which logically follows from the first two. as explained above
	has been stated in the third sentence of the verse &quot;To Him you
	have to return in the end.' Obviously, when a creature endowed with
	power and authority has been created in a wise and purposeful system
	of the universe, wisdom does not require that he should be left to
	live irresponsibly in the world, but it necessarily requires that
	that creature should be accountable to the Being Who has granted it
	this position and rank and blessed it with these powers; 'Returning&quot;
	in this verse does not merely mean to return but to return for
	accountability. In the following verses it has been explained that
	this return will not be in this life but into the second life after
	death, and its right time will he when all mankind will be
	resurrected and gathered together simultaneously for accountability,
	and in consequence of the accountability man will be rewarded or
	punished on the ground whether he had used the powers given him by
	God in the right way or the wrong way. As for the question, why
	cannot this accountability be held in the present lift of the world?
	and why is its right time only the second lift after death'? and why
	is it necessary that this accountability be held only when all
	mankind has passed away from this world, and all the former and the
	latter generations have been resurrected and gathered together
	simultaneously? If man only uses his common sense a little, he can
	understand that all this is perfectly rational as well as the very
	demand of wisdom and reason that accountability should be held in
	the second lift and of all mankind together. The first reason is
	that man is accountable for his whole life-work. Therefore, the
	right time of his accountability should necessarily be when his
	life-work has come to an end. The sccond reason is that man is
	responsible for all those effects and influences which he produces
	by his acts on the lives of others, and those influences and effects
	do not come to an end with his death but continue to influence
	others till ages after him Therefore, true accountability call he
	held only when the life-work of entire mankind has come to an end
	and all the former and the latter generations are gathered together
	simultaneously for accountability. (For further explanation, see
	E.N. 30 of Al-,A'raf. E.N.'s 10, 11 of Yunus E.N. 105 of Hud E.N. 35
	of An-Nahl, E.N. 9 of AI-Hajj, E.N. 27 of An.Naml, E.N.'s 5,6 of
	Ar-Rum, E.N.'s 29, 30 of Suad, E.N. 80 of AI-Mu'min, E.N.'s 27 to 29

<DIV ID="sdfootnote9">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote9sym" HREF="#sdfootnote9anc">9</A>That
	is, &quot;He is aware not only of those acts of man, which come to
	the notice of the people but He knows also those acts which remain
	hidden from them. Moreover, He does not only see the superficial
	form of the acts, but also knows what intention and purpose underlay
	each act of man and with what motive and aim he did whatever he did-
	This is such a truth that if man ponders over it seriously, he can
	fully well understand that justice can be done only in the
	Hereafter, and only in God's Court can real justice be possibly
	done. Man's own intellect itself demands that man must be punished
	for each of his crimes. But everyone knows that in the world most of
	the crimes remain hidden. or the culprit escapes punishment because
	of insufficient evidence, or even if the crime becomes revealed, the
	culprit is so influential and powerful that he cannot be punished.
	Then the intellect of man also requires that man should not be
	punished only because his behavior resembles a criminal act, but it
	should be ascertained that he has committed the act intentionally
	and deliberately and at the time he committed it, he was acting as a
	responsible agent, his intention in actual fact was to commit the
	crime, and he knew that what he was doing was a crime. That is why
	the worldly courts inquire into these things when they decide the
	cases, and regard such an inquiry as a demand of the rule of
	justice. Burt is there any means available in the world by which
	these things may be precisely ascertained beyond every shadow of
	doubt? Considered from this viewpoint, this verse also bears a deep
	logical relevance to Allah Almighty's saying: e has created the
	earth and the heavens with Truth.&quot; The necessary demand of
	creating them with Truth is that perfect justice should prevail in
	this universe. Such justice can be established only when every act
	of a responsible man may not only remain concealed from the eyes of
	the one administering justice but the intention with which a person
	performed and act also should not remain hidden from him. And
	obviously, there cannot be any being, apart from the Creator of the
	universe, who can administer such justice, Now, if a person denies
	Allah and the Hereafter, he in fact, asserts that we humans live in
	a universe which is devoid of justice, which is rather a place where
	justice cannot possibly be done. The person whose intellect, mind
	and conscience feel satisfied at such an assumption would be a
	shameless creature if be thought he was bing progressive and
	rationalistic and those people antiquated and retrogressive who
	accept a highly rational concept about the universe, which the
	Qur'an presents.

	is the third place where Allah Almighty has instructed His Prophet
	to tell the people by swearing an oath by his Lord that such a thing
	shall certainly happen. First, in Surah Yunus, it was said: &quot;They
	ask: Is what you say really true Tel! them: Yes, by my Lord, it is

	swearing an oath or without swearing an oath? when he does not
	believe in it at all, will he believe in it only because you arc
	asserting this on oath? The answer is: In the first place, the
	addressees of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah s peace) were the
	people, who knew from their personal knowledge and experience that
	he had never uttered a lie in his life. Therefore, even if they

	tongue, yet in their hearts they could never conceive that a
	truthful man like him could say a thing on oath by Allah of which he
	himself was not convinced by knowledge and experience. Secondly, the
	Holy Prophet did not only present the doctrine of the Hereafter but
	also gave highly rational Arguments for it. What distinguishes a
	Prophet from others is that the arguments, however strong and

	stands at A notch higher level than a philosopher. His real position
	is not that be has arrived at the conclusion of the necessity of the
	Hereafter by the exercise of reason But his real position is that he
	has the knowledge that the Hereafter shall occur and says with
	conviction that it shall surely occur. Therefore, only a Prophet can
	swear an oath to declare this but not a philosopher. Then, faith in
	the Hereafter can be generated only by a 'Prophet's statement; the
	reasoning of a philosopher does not have the power to induce even

	argument, not to speak of another person. if the philosopher is
	really correct, he cannot go beyond 'should be or ought to be;' only
	a Prophet can assert with conviction that a thing &quot;is and

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Taghabun
	is from ghabn, which can be pronounced both as ghabn and as ghaban.
	Ghabn is mostly used concerning commercial and business transactions

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	commentators while explaining the meaning of Yawn-ut-taghabun have
	given several meanings of it, which are all correct, and throw light
	on different aspects of its meaning. Some commentators have
	explained that on that Day the dwellers of Paradise will take away
	that share of the dwellers of Hell which they would have had in
	Paradise had they done good deeds in the world as did the dwellers
	of Paradise and the dwellers of Hell will take away that share of
	the people of Paradise, which they would have had in Hell had they
	done evil deeds is the world. This is supported by a Hadith, which
	Bukhari has rdated in kitab ar-Riqaq. on the authority of Hadrat Abu
	Hurairah, saying that the Holy Prophet said: 'Whoever goes to
	Paradise will be shown the place which he would have had in Hell had
	he done evil deeds in the world so that he may give more and more
	thanks to God; and whoever goes to Hell will be shown the place
	which he would have had in Paradise had he done good deeds in the
	world so that he may feel more and more remorseful.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	other commentators say that on that Day the wronged one will take
	away so many of the good deeds done by the wrongdoer as may be a
	suitable compensation for the wrong suffered, or the wrongdoer will
	be equal in weight with his usurped rights. For on the Day of
	Resurrection man will not possess any wealth which he they give to
	make up for the wrong done, there the only commodity worth exchange
	will be one's conduct. Therefore, whoever had wronged another in the
	world, will have to make up for the wrong done by surrendering some
	of his own good deeds in his favor, or by taking some of his sins on
	himself and suffering the punishment for them. This theme also has
	been reported from the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) in
	Ahadith. In Bukhari (Kitab ar-Riqaq) a tradition has been related
	from Hadrat Abu Hurairah, saying that the Holy Prophet said:
	&quot;Whoever bears a burden of a wrong done to his brothel, should
	compensate him for it here, for in the Hereafter no one will have
	any wealth or money for compensation. There, some of his good deeds
	will he taken from him and given away to the wronged person, or if
	he did not have enough good deeds, some of the sins of the wronged
	person will be transferred to him.&quot; Likewise, in Musnad Ahmad
	there is a tradition from Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah bin Unais. sag
	that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;No dweller of Paradise will enter
	Paradise and no dweller of Hell will enter Hell until he will have
	compensated the other person for the wrong done to him so much so
	that one will have to compensate even for a slap given to another
	person. We asked; How will this compensation be made when on
	Resurrection we shall be naked and penniless? The Holy Prophet
	replied:Compensation will he made by means of the good deeds and the
	evil deeds.&quot; In Muslim and Musnad Ahmad there is a tradition
	from Hadrat Abu Hurairah, saying that the Holy Prophet upon whom by
	Allah's peace) once asked the people sitting in his assembly; &quot;Do
	you know who is poor? The people replied: He who has nothing to
	possess The Holy Prophet said: In my Ummah the poor is he who
	appeared before his God on the Day of Resurrection with his acts of
	the Prayer and the Fast and the payment of the zakat the while he
	had abused some one, usurped the property of another, and shed blood
	or hit still another. Then his good deeds were taken away and given
	over to each of the wronged and when nothing was left of his good
	deeds to make compensation. sonic of the sins of each wronged one
	were transferred to him and he was east into Hell.&quot; In another
	Hadith which Muslim and Abu Da'ud have related on the authority of
	Hadrat. Buraidah, the Holy Prophet said:&quot;If in the absence from
	home of a soldier for the cause of Allah, a person treats his wife
	and the people of his house treacherously. the person would be made
	to stand before the soldier on the Day of Resurrection, and the
	latter would be asked to take away whatever he liked from his good
	deeds. Saying this the Holy Prophet turned to us and said Then what
	do you say? That is, what do you think he would leave with him?&quot;
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	other commentators say that tile word taghabun is mostly used
	concerning commerce and business, and in the Holy Qur'an at several
	places the attitude that the believer and the unbeliever adopt in
	their worldly lives has been compared to trade and commerce. If the
	believer giving up disobedience adopts obedience and invests his
	life and wealth and effort for the cause of God. he is giving up a
	bad bargain and investing his capital in a business which will fetch
	him much gain and profit in the end. On the contrary, if an
	unbeliever abandons the way of obedience and invests his entire
	capital in the way of disobedience to God, he in fact, is a trader
	who has purchased deviation for guidance, and will incur loss in the
	end. The gain and the loss of to both will become manifest on the
	Day of Resurrection. It may well so happen in the world that the
	believer appears to be the loser and the disbeliever the gainer But
	in the Hereafter they will see who actually had made the right
	bargain and who the wrong bargain This theme has occurred at many
	places in the Qur'an,e.g. in AI-Baqarah 16, 175, 207 Al- Imran
	77,177 An-Nisa' 74; At-Taubah 111 An-Nahl95, Fatir 29, As-Saff 10. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Yet
	another from of taghabun is that in the world the people go on
	cooperating with one another in unbelief and sin, injustice and
	wickedness, with full peace of mind with the confidence that they
	are enjoying full mutual love and friendship. The mutual intrigues
	and comradeship of the members of wicked Families immoral guides and
	their followers, gangs of thieves and robbers alliances of corrupt
	and unjust officers and officials, groups of dishonest traders,
	industrialists and land owners, groups established to spread
	deviation, error and mischief, and nations and governments which
	support and uphold injustice and wickedness in the world, is based
	on the same confidence. The individuals belonging to each of these
	groups harbor the impression that they are good companions of one
	another and their mutual cooperation is proving very successful But
	when these people reach the Hereafter, they will suddenly wake up to
	the realization that they had been grievously mistaken and deceived.
	Each one of them would feel that the one whom he considered his best
	father brother wife husband child, friend, companion, leader, guide
	disciple or supporter and helper, had been, in fact, his worst
	enemy. Every kind of relationship and friendship and bond of love
	and reverence will change into enmity. They will all abuse and curse
	each other and each one will desire that maximum responsibility of
	his crimes be laid an the other and will strive to get him severely
	punished. This theme also has occurred at many places in the Qur'an,
	e.g. in AI-Baqrah: 167, AI-A'raf: 37 to 39, Ibrahim 21-22;
	AI-Mu'minum: 101, Al-'Ankabut: 12,13. 25; Luqman: 33, AI-Ahzab:
	67,68; Saba: 31 to 33; Fatir 18: As-Saaffat: 27 to 3: Suad: 59 to
	61: Ha Mim: As-Sajdah: 29; Az-Zukhruf; 67; Ad-Dukhan; 41;

	verse has two meanings. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to the first meaning, it applies to most of those difficulties,
	which are encountered by many believing men from their wives and the
	women from their husbands and the parents from their children in
	following the way of God. It seldom so happens in the world that a
	man has a wife and a wife a husband, who are full companions and
	helpers of each other in the matter of faith and righteousness, and
	that both may also have such children as may be the comfort of their
	eyes as regards faith and deeds, morals and conduct. Hut generally
	it so happens that if the husband is righteous and honest, the wife
	and children look upon his honesty and piety and righteousness as a
	misfortune for themselves, and want that the husband and the father
	should earn Hell for their sake, and giving up the distinction
	between the lawful and the unlawful should provide means of luxury
	and enjoyment, sin and vice, for them in every passable way. On the
	contrary, many a time a pious believing woman happens to have a
	husband, Who does not at all approve her obedience to the Laws of
	God, and the children too, following in the footsteps of the father,
	make the wife of the mother miserable by their deviation and evil
	deeds. Then, particularly, when during the conflict between Islam
	and unbelief a man's faith demands that he should suffer losses for
	the sake of Allah and this Religion, run risks, emigrate from the
	country or even endanger his life by joining the war against
	unbelief, the greatest hindrance in his way are the people of his
	own household.

	second meaning relates to those special circumstances which most of
	the Muslims were facing at the time these verses were sent down. and
	today also they are faced by every person who embraces Islam in a
	non-Muslim society. At that dine in Makkah and in other parts of
	Arabia a situation that was commonly being experienced was that a
	man would embrace Islam, but his wife and children would not only be
	disinclined to accept it but would try their best to press him to
	give up Islam Arid similar were the situations encountered by the
	women, the alone embraced Islam in their families, 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Addressing
	the believers who may be confronted with either situation, three
	things have been impressed: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	they have been warned as if to say: &quot;Although front the worldly
	point of view. these are the dearest relations of man yet from the
	religious point of view, they arc .`your enemies.&quot; This enmity
	may he for the reason that they hinder you from good and induce you
	to do evil, or that they restrain you from belief and pull you
	towards unbelief, or that their sympathies are with he unbelievers.
	and through you if they ever come to know any of the war secrets of
	the Muslims, they convey it to the enemies of Islam. Owing to these
	the nature and quality of enmity may vary, but in any case it is
	enmity; and if you hold your faith dearer to your heart, you should
	regard them as your enemies. In their love you should never forget
	that between you and them there stands the barrier of belief and
	unbelief, or of obedience and disobedience.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then, it
	is said: &quot;Beware of them.&quot; That is, &quot;You should not
	ruin your eternal life for the sake of their worldly life. Let not
	their love so overwhelm you that they become a hindrance for you in
	your relationship with Allah and His Messenger and your loyalty to
	Islam. Do not place such reliance on them that the secrets of the
	Muslim community should come to their notice and through them reach
	your enemies only by your negligence and carelessness. This Is the
	Fame thing of which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)
	has warned the Muslims in a Hadith: `A person will be brought up on
	the Day of Resurrection, and it will be proclaimed: `His wife and
	children ate up all his good deeds'.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	end, it is said: &quot;If you pardon and overlook and forgive, Allah
	is surely AII-Forgiving, All-Merciful. &quot; It means: &quot;You
	are being made aware of their enmity so that you may beware of them
	and do your best to save your faith from them, This warning does
	not, however, mean that you should treat your wife and children
	harshly, or strain your relations with them so as w make your own
	and their domestic lift miserable and wretched For if you did so,
	two of the disadvantages would obviously result: first, it may close
	down every avenue to the reformation of the wife and children for
	ever; second, it may give rise to suspicions and misgivings against
	Islam in the society and the people around may form the impression
	that a Muslim turns unduly rigid and ill-tempered for his own
	children in his own house as soon as he has embraced Islam. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection, one should also keep in mind that in the beginning when
	the people became Muslims, they encountered a special difficulty if
	their parents were unbelievers. They would press their children to
	give up the new Faith. They would face another difficulty when their
	wives and children (or in case of women, their husbands and
	children) persisted unbelief and would force them to abandon the
	Faith of Truth. About the first difficulty, instruction was given in
	Al-Ankabut: 8 and Luqman; 14-15, saying: &quot;Treat your parents
	well but if they press you to join with Me another about whom you
	have no knowledge, do not obey them at all &quot; About the second
	difficulty the Instruction has been given here, saying: &quot;You
	must try to save your faith from your children and family members
	but do not treat them harshly, but rather politely and leniently.&quot;
	(For further explanation, see At-Taubah: 23-24; E N. 37 of
	AI-Mujadalah, E.N.'s 1 to 3 of Al-Mumtahanah; E.N. 18 of
	Munafiqun).&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote30sym" HREF="#sdfootnote30anc">30</A>For
	explanation, sec E.N. 23 of Surah AI-Anfal. Here one should also
	keep in view the Holy Prophet's saying which Tabarani has related on
	the authority of Hadrat Abu Malik al-Ash'ari, saying: &quot;Your
	real enemy is not he whom if you kill there is success for you, and
	if he kills you, there is Paradise for you; but your real enemy may
	b your own child who is born of your own loins, or the wealth of
	which you are the owner.&quot; That is why here us well as in
	Al-Anfal: 28, Allah says: If you save yourselves from the temptation
	and allurements of worldly possessions and Children and succeed in
	keeping love of them subject to the love of Allah, there are rich
	rewards for you with Allah.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote31">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote31sym" HREF="#sdfootnote31anc">31</A>At
	another place in the Qur'an it has been said: &quot;Fear Allah as He
	should actually be feared.&quot; (Al-'Imran: 102). At still another
	place: &ldquo;Allah does not burden any one with a responsibility
	heavier than he can bear.&quot; (Al-Baqarah: 286) And here: &quot;Fear
	Allah as far as you can.&quot; When these three verses are read
	together it appears that the first verse sets an ideal which every
	believer should try to attain. The second verse lays down the
	principle that no one has been required to exert himself. beyond his
	power and ability, for in Allah's Religion one has been made
	responsible only for what is within one's power and ability. This
	verse enjoins every believer to try to attain piety and
	consciousness of God as far as he can. He should carry out His
	Commands and avoid His disobedience as best as he possibly can. For
	if he shows laxity in this regard, he will not be able to escape
	punishment. However, one will not be held accountable for what was
	beyond one's power (and Allah alone can decide best what was really
	beyond a person's power and ability).</P>
