<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this surah the story of the Prophet Noah has not been related only
for the sake of story telling, but its object is to warn the
disbelievers of Makkah, so as to say:&quot;You, O people of Makkah,
are adopting towards Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and
blessings) the same attitude as the people of the Prophet Noah had
adopted towards him; if you do not change this attitude, you too
would meet with the same end.&quot; This had not been said in so many
words anywhere in the Surah, but in the background of the conditions
under which this story was narrated to the people of Makkah, this
subject itself became obvious. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
after suffering hardships and troubles in the way of preaching his
mission for ages the report that he made to his Lord has been given
in vv. 5-20. In it he states how he had been trying to bring his
people to the right path and how his people had stubbornly opposed
him. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this, the Prophet Noah's final submission has been recorded in vv.
21-24, in which he prays to his Lord, saying: &quot;These people have
rejected my invitation: they are blindly following their chiefs, who
have devised a tremendous plot of deceit and cunning. Time now has
come when these people should be deprived of every grace to accept
guidance.&quot; This was not an expression of impatience by the
Prophet Noah, but when after having preached his message under
extremely trying circumstances for centuries be became utterly
disappointed with his people, he formed the opinion that no chance
whatever was left of their coming to the right path. His this opinion
fully conformed to Allah's own decision. Thus, in the next verse
(25), it has been said: &quot;The torment of Allah descended on those
people because of their misdeeds.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the concluding verse, the Prophet Noah's supplication that he made to
his Lord, right at the time the torment descended, has been recorded.
In it he prays for his own and for all the believers' forgiveness,
and makes a submission to Allah to the effect: &quot;Do not leave any
of the disbelievers alive on the earth, for they have become utterly
devoid of every good: they will not beget any but disbelieving and
wicked descendants.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	rebellious attitude against God causes man to lead a wretched life
	not only in the Hereafter but also in this world, Contrary to this,
	if a nation adopts the way of faith and piety and obedience to
	Divine Commands, instead of disobedience, it benefits it not only in
	the Hereafter but also in the world; it is favored with every kind
	of blessing. In Surah Ta Ha it has been said: &quot;And whoever
	turns away from My Admonition, will have a wretched life in the
	world, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of Resurrection.&quot;
	(v. 124). In Surah AI-Ma'idah it has been said: &quot;Had the people
	of the Book observed the Torah and the Gospel and the other Books
	which had been sent down by their Lord, abundance of provisions
	would have been given to them from above and from beneath.&quot; (v.

	and adopted the way of piety, We would have opened on them doors of
	blessings from the heavens and the earth.&quot; (v. 96). In Surah
	Hud, the Prophet Hud addressed his people, saying: &quot;And O my
	people, beg forgiveness of your Lord, then turn to Him in penitence,
	and He will open the gates of heavens for you and add more strength
	to your present strength.&quot; (v. 52). Through the Holy Prophet
	himself in this very Surah Hud, the people of Makkah have been
	admonished to the effect: &quot;And you should beg forgiveness of
	your Lord, then return to Him, and He will provide you with good
	provisions of life till an appointed term.&quot; (v. 3). According
	to the Hadid, the Holy Prophet said to the Quraish: &quot;There is a
	word which. if you accept, would enable you to rule over the Arab as
	well as the non-Arab world.&quot; (For explanation, see E.N. 96 of

	needed to function as a man in the world. Then you came out as a
