<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Its
theme is affirmation of Resurrection and the life hereafter; It also
warns of the consequences of belying the Messenger of God. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Surah opens with oaths sworn by the angels who take the soul at
deaths and those who hasten to carryout Allah's Commands, and those
who conduct the affairs of the universe according to Divine Will, to
assure that the Resurrection will certainly come to pass and the
second life after death will certainly take place. For the angels who
are employed to pluck out the soul today can also be employed to
restore the soul tomorrow, and the angels who promptly execute
Allah's Commands and conduct the affairs of the universe today can
also upset the order of the universe tomorrow by orders of the same
God and can also bring about a new order. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this the people have been told, so as to say: &quot;This work which
you regard as absolutely impossible, is not any difficult for Allah,
for which He may have to make lengthy preparations. Just a single
jolt will upset this system of the world and a second jolt will be
enough to cause you to appear as living beings in the new world. At
that time the same people who were wont to deny it, would be
trembling with fear and seeing with awe struck eyes all that they
thought was impossible. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
relating the story of the Prophet Moses and Pharaoh briefly, the
people have been warned to the effect: &quot;You know full well what
fate the Pharaoh met in consequence of belying the Messenger and
rejecting the guidance brought by him and endeavoring to defeat his
mission by trickery and deceit. If you do not learn any lesson from
it and do not change your ways and attitude accordingly, you also
will have to meet the same fate. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
in vv. 27-13, arguments have been given for the Hereafter and life
after death. In this regard, the deniers have been asked the
question:&quot;Is your resurrection a more difficult task or the
creation of the huge Universe which spreads around you to infinite
distances with myriads of its stars and planets? Your recreation
cannot be difficult for the God for Whom this was an easy task. Thus,
after presenting in a single sentence, a decisive argument for the
possibility of the Hereafter, attention has been drawn to the earth
and its provisions that have been arranged in it for the sustenance
of man and animal and of which everything testifies that it has been
created with great wisdom for fulfilling some special purpose.
Pointing to this the question has been left for the intellect of man
to ponder for itself and form the opinion whether calling man to
account after having delegated authority and responsibilities to a
creature like him in this wise system would be more in keeping with
the demands of wisdom, or that he should die after committing all
sorts of misdeeds in the world and should perish and mix in the dust
for ever and should never be called to account as to how he employed
the authority and fulfilled the responsibilities entrusted to him.
Instead of discussing this question, in vv. 34-41, it has been said:
&quot;When the Hereafter is established, men's eternal future will be
determined on the criterion as to which of them rebelled against his
God transgressing the bounds of service and made the material
benefits and pleasures his objective of life and which of them feared
standing before his Lord and refrained from fulfilling the unlawful
desires of the self.&quot; This by itself provides the right answer
to the above question to every such person who considers it honestly,
free from stubbornness. For the only rational, logical and moral
demand of giving authority and entrusting responsibilities to man in
the world is that he should be called to account on this very basis
ultimately and rewarded or punished accordingly. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
conclusion, the question of the disbelievers of Makkah as to when
Resurrection will take place, has been answered. They asked the Holy
Prophet this question over and over again. In reply it has been said
that the knowledge of the time of its occurrence rests with Allah
alone. The Messenger is there only to give the warning that it will
certainly come. Now whoever wishes may mend his ways, fearing its
coming, and whoever wishes may behave and conduct himself as he
likes, fearless of its coming. When the appointed time comes, those
very people who loved the life of this world and regarded its
pleasures as the only object of life, would feel that they had stayed
in the world only for an hour or so. Then they will realize how
utterly they had ruined their future for ever for the sake of the
short lived pleasures of the world. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>Here,
	the object for which an oath has been sworn by beings having five
	qualities has not been mentioned; but the theme that follows by
	itself leads to the conclusion that the oath has been sworn to
	affirm that the Resurrection is a certainty, which must come to
	pass, when all dead men shall be resurrected. Nor is there any
	mention as to what are the beings possessed of the qualities.
	However, a large number of the Companions and their immediate
	successors and most of the commentators have expressed the opinion
	that they are the angels. Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Hadrat
	`Abdullah bin `Abbas, Masruq, Sa`id bin Jubair, Abu salih Abud-Duha
	and Suddi; say that &quot;those who pluck out from the depths and
	those who draw out gently&quot; imply the angels, who wrench out the
	soul of man at death from the very depths of his body, from its
	every fiber. &quot;Those who glide about swiftly&quot;, according to
	Hadrat Ibn Mas`ud, Mujahid, Sa`id bin Jubair and Abu Salih, also
	imply the angels, who hurry about swiftly in execution of Divine
	Commands as though they were gliding through space. The same meaning
	of &quot;those who hasten out as in a race&quot; has been taken by
	Hadrat `Ali, Mujahid, Masruq, Abu Salih and Hasan Bari, and
	hastening out implies that each one of them hurries on his errand as
	soon as he receives the first indication of Divine Will. &quot;Those
	who conduct the affairs&quot; also imply the angels as has been
	reported from Hadrat `Ali, Mujahid, 'Ata' Abu -Salih, Hasan Bari;,
	Qatadah, Rabi` bin Anas and Suddi. In other words, these are the
	workers of the Kingdom of the Universe, who are conducting all the
	affairs of the world in accordance with Allah's Command and Will.
	Though this meaning of these verses has not been reported in any
	authentic Hadith from the Holy Prophet, while this meaning has been
	given by some major Companions and their immediate successors and
	pupils, one is led to form the view that they must have obtained
	this knowledge from the Holy Prophet himself. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now the
	question arises: On what basis has the oath been sworn by these
	angels for the occurrence of the Resurrection and life after death
	when they themselves are as imperceptible as the thing for the
	occurrence of which they have been presented as an evidence and as
	an argument. In our opinion the reason is (and Allah has the best
	knowledge) that the Arabs were not deniers of the existence of the
	angels. They themselves admitted that at the death the soul was
	taken out by the angels; they also believed that the angels moved at
	tremendous speeds; they could reach any place between the earth and
	the heavens instantly and promptly execute any errand that was
	entrusted to them. They also acknowledged that the angels are
	subordinate to Divine Will and they conduct the affairs of the
	universe strictly and precisely in accordance with Divine Will; they
	are not independent and masters of their will. They regarded them as
	daughters of Allah out of ignorance and worshiped them as deities,
	but they did not believe that they possessed the real authority as
	well. Therefore, the basis of the reasoning from the above mentioned
	attributes for the occurrence of the Resurrection and life after
	death is that the angels who took the soul by the order of God,
	could also restore the soul by the order of the same God; and the
	angels who conducted the affairs of the universe by the order of God
	could also upset this universe by the order of the same God whenever
	. He so ordered them and could also bring about a new world order.
	They would not show any negligence or delay in the execution of His
	Command.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote8">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote8sym" HREF="#sdfootnote8anc">8</A>Here,
	one should understand a few things well:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	dialogue that took place between the Prophet Moses and Allah
	Almighty at the time of appointing him to the office of Prophethood
	has been related at some places briefly and at others in full detail
	in the Qur'an as the occasion demanded. Here; brevity was the need;
	therefore, only a resume has been given. Fuller details are found in
	Ta Ha: 9-48, Ash-Shua`ra': 10-17, An Naml: 7-12, AI-Qasas: 29-35. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	rebellion of the Pharaoh referred to here relates to his
	transgressing the bounds of service and rebelling both against the
	Creator and against His creatures. As for his rebellion against the
	Creator, it is being mentioned a little below when he gathered his
	people together and prolaimed: &quot;I am your lord, the supreme.&quot;
	As against the creatures his rebellion was that he had divided his
	subjects into classes; he treated the weak classes tyrannically and
	had reduced his entire nation to slavery as has been mentioned in
	Al-Qasas: 4 and Az-Zukhruf: 54. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	instruction given to Moses was: &quot;Go, you and your brother
	Aaron, to Pharaoh for he has transgressed all bounds. Talk to him
	gently; maybe that he is convinced by admonition or is imbued with
	fear.&quot; (Ta Ha: 44). One model of the gentle speech has been
	given in these verses, which shows what right method a preacher
	should adopt when preaching to a perverted man. Other models are
	given in Ta Ha: 49-52, Ash-Shua`ra': 23-28, and Al-Qasas: 37. These
	verses are of those in which Allah has taught the correct methods of
	preaching Islam in the Qur'an. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	Prophet Moses had not been sent to Pharaoh only for the deliverance
	of the children of Israel as some people seem to think but the
	primary object of his appointment was to show Pharaoh and his people
	the right way, and the second object was that if he did not accept
	the right way, the children of Israel (who in fact were a Muslim
	people) should be taken out of his slavery and from Egypt. This
	thing becomes plain from these verses too, for there is no mention
	whatever in these of the deliverance of the children of Israel, but
	the Prophet Moses has been commanded to present the message of the
	Truth before Pharaoh, and this is confirmed by those verses also in
	which the Prophet Moses has preached Islam as well as demanded
	freedom of the children of Israel, e.g. see Al-A`raf 104-105, Ta Ha:
	47-52, Ash-Shua ara': 16-17, 23-28. (For further explanation, see
	E.N. 74 of Yunus). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) Here,
	&quot;to adopt purity&quot; means to adopt purity of belief, morals
	and deeds, or, in other words, to accept Islam. Ibn Zaid says:
	&quot;Wherever in the Qur'an the word tazakka (purity) has been use,
	it implies acceptance of Islam.&quot; As an example of this he has
	cited the following three verses: &quot;And this is the reward of
	him who adopts purity&quot;, i.e. accepts Islam; &quot;and what
	would make you know that he might adopt purity&quot;, i.e. becomes a
	Muslim (`Abasa:3); &quot;And you would not be responsible if he did
	not adapt purity&quot;, i.e. did not become a Muslim (`Abasa: 7).
	(Ibn Jarir). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) &quot;That
	I may guide you to your Lord so that you may have fear (of Him)&quot;
	means: &quot;When you recognize your Lord and come to know that you
	are His slave, and not a free man, you will inevitably have fear of
	Him in your heart, for fear of God is the thing on which depends the
	right attitude of man in the world. Without the knowledge and fear
	of God no purity of the self can be possible.&quot;</P>

	a living serpent right in front of the eyes of the people, that it
	should devour the artificial serpents produced by the magicians out
	of their staffs and cords, and when the Prophet Moses should pick it

	Prophet but a magician, and that the miracle worked by him of
	turning a staff into a serpent, could also be worked by other
	magicians. But this device of his recoiled upon himself and the

<DIV ID="sdfootnote11">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote11sym" HREF="#sdfootnote11anc">11</A>This
	proclamation of Pharaoh has been mentioned at several places in the
	Qur'an. On one occasion he said to the Prophet Moses: &quot;If you
	took another one as a deity beside me, I would cast you in the
	prison.&quot; (Ash-Shua`ra': 29). On another occasion he had
	addressed his courtiers, saying: &quot;O chiefs, I do not know of
	any other god of yours than myself. (Al-Qasas.: 38). By this Pharaoh
	did not mean, nor could he ever mean, that he himself was the
	creator of the universe and he had made the world, nor that he
	denied the existence of Allah and claimed to be lord of the
	universe, nor that he regarded only himself as a deity of the people
	in the religious sense. In the Qur'an itself there is a clear
	testimony that as regards religion he himself worshiped other gods.
	Once his courtiers said to him: &quot;Will you leave Moses and his
	people free to spread chaos in the land, and let them discard you
	and your deities?&quot; (Al A`raf: 127). And in the Qur'an itself
	this saying of the Pharaoh also has been cited: &quot;Had Moses been
	sent by Allah, why were not bracelets of gold sent down to him, or a
	company of angels as attendants?&quot; (AzZukhruf: 53). Thus, in
	fact, he called himself a god and supreme deity not in the religious
	but in the political sense. What he meant was that he possessed the
	sovereign rights: no one beside him had the right to rule in his
	kingdom and there was no superior power whose orders could be
	enforced in the land. (For further explanation. see E.N. 85 of

	the earth after the creation of the heavens, but it is a style of
	expression just like our saying after making mention of something:
	&quot;Then this is noteworthy.&quot; The object is not to express
	the sequence of occurrence between the two things but to draw
	attention from the first to the second thing although both may exist
	together. Several instances of this style are found in the Qur'an,
	e.g. in Surah Al-Qalam it is said: &quot;(He is) oppressive, and
	after that, ignoble by birth.&quot; This does not mean that first he
	became oppressive and then he turned ignoble by birth, but it means:
	&quot;He is oppressive, and above all, ignoble by birth.&quot;
	Likewise, in Surah Al-Balad it is said: &quot;Should free a

	that first he should act righteously and then believe. but that
	along with doing righteous deeds he should also be characterized by
	belief. Here, one should also understand that at some places in the
	Qur'an the creation of the earth has been mentioned first and then
	the creation of the heavens, as in Al-Baqarah: 29, and at others the
	creation of the heavens has been mentioned first and then of the
	earth, as in these verses. There is, in fact, no contradiction in
	this. At no place the object is to tell what was created first and
	what afterwards, but wherever the context requires that the
	excellences of the power of Allah be made prominent, the heavens
	have been mentioned first and then the earth, and where the context
	requires that the people be made to appreciate and acknowledge the
	blessings that they are benefiting by on the earth, the mention of

	within 24 hours and also those regions where there are longer days
	and longer nights. A very large part of the earth's population lives
	in the first kind of the regions. Then as the days and nights go on
	becoming longer and longer, life goes on becoming harder and harder
	and population thinner and thinner. So much so that the regions
	where there are six-month-long days and six-month-long nights, are
	not at all fit for human settlement. Arranging both these types of
	the land on this very earth Allah has provided the evidence that
	this regular order of the alternation of night and day has not come
	about accidentally but has been brought about with great wisdom
	precisely in accordance with a scheme to make the earth a place fit
	for human settlement. Likewise, spreading out the earth so that it
	becomes a fit place to live in, providing in it that water which
	should be palatable for man and animal and a cause of growth for
	vegetation, setting in it mountains and creating all those things
	which may become a means of life for both man and animal- all these
	are a manifest sign that they are not chance happenings of the
	purposeless works of a care-free person but each one of these has
	been arranged purposefully by a Supreme, Wise Being. Now every
	sensible and intelligent man can consider for himself whether the
	necessity and occurrence of the Hereafter is the requirement of
	wisdom or its negation. The person who in spite of seeing all this
	says that there is no Hereafter, in fact, says that everything in
	the universe is happening wisely and purposefully, but only the
	creation of man on the earth as a being endowed with sense and power
	is meaningless and foolish. For there could be nothing more
	purposeless than delegating to man vast powers of appropriation in
	the earth and providing him an opportunity to do good as well as
	evil deeds but then failing to ever subject him to accountability.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote21sym" HREF="#sdfootnote21anc">21</A>Here,
	in a few words, it has been told briefly what shall be the criterion
	of the final judgment in the Hereafter. One kind of the conduct of
	life in the world is that transgressing all bounds of service man
	should rebel against his God and should make up his mind that he
	would seek only the benefits and pleasures of this world in whatever
	way they could be sought and achieved. The other kind of conduct is
	that while man passes life in the world he should constantly keep in
	view the truth that ultimately one day he has to stand before his
	Lord, and should refrain from fulfilling the evil desires of the
	self only for the fear that if he earned an unlawful benefit in
	obedience to his self, or enjoyed an evil pleasure, what answer he
	would give to his Lord. The criterion of the judgment in the
	Hereafter will be which of the two kinds of conduct he adopted in
	the world. If he had adopted the first kind of conduct, his
	permanent abode would be Hell, and if he had adopted the second kind
	of conduct, his permanent home would be Paradise.&nbsp;
