internal evidence (vv. 27-31 and vv. 34-48) shows that this Surah was
revealed in the last stage of the Mission of the Holy Prophet at
Makkah and during the same period in which Surahs Yunus, Hud and Al-
A'araf were sent down. The manner of speech indicates that a long
time had passed since the Holy Prophet had been conveying the
Message. On the one hand, his opponents had been contriving different
devices to defeat him and his Mission, and, on the other, his
followers had been expressing a desire that by showing a miracle the
disbelievers might be brought to the Right Way. In answer, Allah
impressed on the Believers that it is not His way to convert people
by this method and that they should not lose heart, if He is giving
the enemies of the Truth a rope long enough to hang themselves.
Otherwise, He is able to show such signs as may bring the dead out of
their graves and make them speak (v. 31), but even then these
obdurate people will invent an excuse to explain this away. All this
decisive evidence clearly proves that this Surah was revealed during
the last stage of the Prophet's Mission at Makkah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

ignorance. Moreover, the aim of the Surah is not merely to satisfy
the minds but also to appeal to the hearts to accept the Faith.
Therefore it does not merely put forward logical arguments in support
of the truth of the Message and against the people's wrong notions,
but at appropriate intervals it makes frequent use of sympathetic and
earnest appeals to win over their hearts by warning them of the
consequences of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">kufr</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

been removed. At the same time, the Believers; who had been passing
through long and hard ordeal and were feeling tired, and waiting
anxiously for Allah's succor, have been comforted and filled with
hope and courage. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	the fact that Allah has not only created the earth, but also rules
	over His Kingdom, and that His universe is a factory that is not

	truth of all the claims that have been made in this verse. Therefore
	no proofs were required of the facts that it is Allah Who raised up

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider this question: How can such an argument as this convince
	those who do not believe at all in the existence of God nor
	acknowledge that He is the Creator of the universe and the Director
	of all its affairs ? The answer is that the arguments in support of
	the Doctrine of Tauhid advanced in the Qur'an to convince the
	mushriks equally apply against the atheists to prove the existence
	of God. It is like this: The whole of the universe-the earth, the
	moon, the sun and the countless heavenly bodies-constitute a perfect
	system which is working, under the same all-powerful Law. This is a
	proof that such a system must have been designed by some
	All-Powerful Sovereign, Who possesses wisdom and unerring knowledge.
	This proves conclusively the existence of that Allah Who has no
	other equal nor associate nor partner. For there can be no system
	without an administrator, no law without a ruler, no wisdom without
	a sage, and no knowledge without the possessor of that knowledge.
	Above all, no one can ever conceive that there can be any creation

	which it comes to an end. This is equally true for each and every

	first thing was quite obvious, it has not been mentioned in the

	to bring to life the whole human race after its death.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The

	have created man and endowed him with wisdom and intelligence and
	invested him with power and authority, and then left him free to do
	what he liked with these, without being responsible and accountable
	for their use or abuse. For His Wisdom demands that He should take
	full account of all the acts and deeds of man in this world. It
	requires that. He should take to task those who committed
	aggressions and compensate their victims and He should give rewards
	to those who practiced virtue and punishments to those who did
	wicked deeds. In short, His Wisdom requires that He should call to
	account every human being and demand: &quot;How did you carry out
	the trust that was placed in your hands in the shape of your
	wonderful body with its wonderful faculties and the numerous
	resources of the earth?&quot; It may be that a foolish and unjust
	ruler of this world might entrust the affairs of his kingdom in the

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote8sym" HREF="#sdfootnote8anc">8</A>After
	citing some heavenly Signs in support of the doctrines of Tauhid and
	the Hereafter, a few Signs are being cited from the earth for the
	same purpose. Briefly the following are the arguments for Tauhid,
	Resurrection and Accountability:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Tauhid: The fact that the earth is closely connected with the
	heavenly bodies (which help create life on it), and the fact that
	the mountains and the rivers are so inter-related with that life are
	clear proofs that all these things have not been created by separate
	and different gods nor are being governed, by gods with independent
	powers and authorities. Had it been so, there could not have been so
	much harmony, congruity, accord and unity of purpose among them; nor
	could these relationships have continued for such a long time. For
	it is quite obvious that if there had not been One All-Powerful and
	All-Wise Allah, it could not have been possible and practicable for
	different gods to sit together and evolve out such a harmonious
	system of the universe without any discord or conflict between its
	myriads of bodies.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Resurrection: This wonderful planet, the earth, is itself a great
	proof that its Creator is All-Powerful and can, therefore, raise the
	dead whenever He will. For it is floating in space round the sun and
	it has high mountains fixed in it and has large rivers flowing on
	its surface: it produces countless fruit-bearing trees and it brings
	about the cycles of the day and the night with precise regularity.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">All these
	things bear witness to the boundless power of its Creator. It would,
	therefore, be sheer folly to doubt that such All-Powerful Creator is
	incapable of raising mankind to life after death.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
	Accountability: The earth, with all its wonderful and purposeful
	signs, is a clear evidence of the fact that its Creator is All-Wise.
	Therefore it cannot even be imagined that He has created man, His
	noblest creation, without any purpose. Just as His wisdom is
	apparent from the structure of the earth, its mountains, its rivers,
	the pairs of its trees and fruits, its night and day, so it is quite
	obvious that it has not been made the habitation of man without any
	purpose, nor will it be brought to naught without the fulfillment of
	that purpose. Clearly mankind shall be accountable to its Creator
	for the fulfillment of that Divine purpose.</P>

	design and purpose in the diversity of the structure of the earth.
	Though it has countless regions adjoining one another, they are
	different from one another in their shapes, colors, component parts,
	characteristics, potentialities, productive capacity and source of
	minerals. This diversity has countless points of wisdom and
	advantage. Let alone other creatures, if we consider the diversity
	of regions from the point of the good it has done to mankind, we
	shall have to acknowledge that this is the result of the
	well-thought and well-planned design of the All-Wise Creator. For
	this diversity has helped the growth of human civilization so much

	things mentioned in this verse contain many other Signs besides the
	proofs of Tauhid and the boundless powers and All-Comprehensive
	Wisdom of Allah. Let us consider one of these, that is the diversity
	in the universe, including mankind. There is the one and the same
	earth but all its regions are quite different from one another. Then
	there is one and the same water but it helps to produce different
	kinds of corn and fruits. Then one and the same tree bears fruits
	which, in spite of likeness, differ from one another in shapes,
	sizes, and other features. Then there is one and the same root from
	which sometimes one and at others two trunks sprout up, with their
	own different characteristics. If one considers these aspects of
	diversity, one shall come to the conclusion that the Divine wisdom
	demands the same kind of diversity in the natures, temperaments and
	inclinations of human beings, and, therefore, in their conducts. So,
	one need not worry about the existence of this diversity. As it has
	been stated in v. 31, if Allah had willed, He could have created all
	human beings alike and virtuous by birth. But the wisdom that
	underlies the creation of the universe, including mankind, requires
	diversity and not uniformity. Otherwise, all this creation would

	shall be punished for it'. (IV :123). The Holy Prophet answered, O

	faithful and obedient servant? Whatever harm or trouble he receives
	in this world-even so much as the pricking of a thorn-is taken by
	Allah as atonement for one or the other of his sins. As regards the
	Hereafter, everyone, who shall be called upon to render an account
	of any sin, shall be punished for it' . At this Hadrat `A'ishah
	asked, `Then what is meant by light reckoning in this verse: Whoso
	shall be given his `Conduct Register' in his right hand, he will
	render a light reckoning?' (LXXXIV:?-8). The Holy Prophet answered,
	`This means merely the presentation of his whole conduct, that is,
	all his deeds-good and bad-shall be presented before Allah but he
	shall not be called upon to clear the account of all his deeds; for
	the one who shall be called upon to clear the whole of his account,
	shall be totally ruined.&quot;</P>

	has been called &quot;fraud&quot; because none of the angels,

	possess these attributes or powers, nor did they ever demand these

	them by this fraud.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The

	wrong ways of deviation that suit the kind of lives they wish to
	lead, they have to invent arguments to pacify their consciences and
