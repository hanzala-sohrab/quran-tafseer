<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this Surah the disbelievers of Makkah have been warned for their
stubbornness which they had adopted against the invitation of the
Holy Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). The amazing
and wonderful phenomenon of the splitting of the Moon was a manifest
sign of the truth that the Resurrection, of which the Holy Prophet
was giving them the news, could take place and that it had approached
near at hand. The great sphere of the Moon had split into two
distinct parts in front of their very eyes. The two parts had
separated and receded so much apart from each other that to the
on-lookers one part had appeared on one side of the mountain and the
other on the other side of it. Then, in an instant the two had
rejoined. This was a manifest proof of the truth that the system of
the Universe was neither eternal nor immortal, it could be disrupted.
Huge stars and Planets could split asunder, disintegrate, collide
with each other, and everything that had been depicted in the Quran
In connection with the description of the details of Resurrection,
could happen. Not only this : it was also a portent that the
disintegration of the system of the Universe had begun and the time
was near when Resurrection would take place. The Holy Prophet (peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him) invited the people's attention to
this event only with this object in view and asked them to mark it
and be a witness to it. But the disbelievers described it as a
magical illusion add persisted in their denial. For this stubbornness
they have been reproached in this Surah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At
the outset it has been said: &quot;These people neither believe in
the admonition, nor learn a lesson from history, nor affirm faith
after witnessing manifest signs with their eyes. Now they would
believe only when Resurrection has taken place and they would be
rushing out of their graves towards the Summoner on that Day.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
the stories of the people of Noah and of 'Ad and Thamud and of the
peoples of Lot and the Pharaoh have been related briefly and they
have been reminded of the terrible punishments that these nations
suffered when they belied and disregarded the warnings given by the
Prophets of God. After the narration of each story the refrain that
has been provided is : &quot;This Qur'an is an easy means of
admonition, which if a nation takes to heart and thereby takes the
Right Way, the torment that descended on the former nations could be
avoided. But it would indeed be a folly if instead of heeding the
admonition through this easy means, one persisted in heedlessness and
disbelieved until one was overtaken by the torment itself.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Likewise,
after citing admonitory precedents from the history of the former
nations, the disbelievers of Makkah have been addressed and warned to
this effect: &quot;If you too adopt the same attitude and conduct for
which the other nations have already been punished, why will you not
be punished for it?Are you in any way a superior people that you
should be treated differently from others? Or, have you received a
deed of amnesty that you will not be punished for the crime for which
others have been punished?And if you feel elated at your great
numbers, you will soon see that these very numbers of yours are put
to rout (on the battlefield) and on the Day of Resurrection you will
be dealt with even more severely.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the end, the disbelievers have been told that Allah does not need to
make lengthy preparations to bring about Resurrection. No sooner does
He give a simple command for it than it will take place immediately.
Like everything else the Universe and mankind also have a destiny.
According to this destiny everything happens at its own appointed
time. It cannot be so that whenever somebody gives a challenge,
Resurrection is brought about in order to convince him. If you adopt
rebellion because you do not see it coming, you will only be adding
to your own distress and misfortune. For your record which is being
prepared by Divine agents, has not left any misdeed of yours, great
or small, unrecorded. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

There have already come to them narratives (of the former

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>That
	is, &quot;The splitting of the Moon asunder is a portent that the
	Hour of Resurrection of which you are being foretold, has drawn near
	at hand, and the order of the Universe has begun to be disrupted.
	Moreover, the incident that a great sphere like the Moon's has split
	into two distinct parts, is a specific proof of the fact that
	Resurrection of which you are being forewarned can take place.
	Obviously, when the Moon can split, the earth also can split, the
	orbits of he stars and planets also can change and the whole system
	of the heavens also can be disturbed. There is nothing eternal and
	everlasting and stable here so that Resurrection may be improbable.&quot;
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people have taken this sentence to mean: &quot;The Moon will split.
	&quot; Although according to Arabic usage it is possible to take
	this meaning, the context clearly rejects it. In the first place, if
	this were the meaning, the first sentence would become meaningless.
	If the Moon had not actually split at the time when this Revelation
	was made, but it was going to split some time in the future, it
	would be absurd to say on the basis of this that the Hour of
	Resurrection had approached near at hand. After all, how can an
	incident that is to take place in the future, be regarded as a sign
	of Resurrection's being near at hand, and how can such a testimony
	be put forward as a rational argument? Second, with this meaning in
	mind when we read the following verses, they appear to be altogether
	incoherent. The verses that follow clearly show that the people at
	that time had witnessed a sign that was a manifest portent of the
	possibility of Resurrection, but they rejected it as a magical
	illusion, and persisted in their belief that Resurrection was not
	possible. In this context, the words inshaqq-al-Qamar can be
	meaningful only if they are taken to mean: &quot;The Moon split
	asunder.&quot; If they are taken to mean: &quot;The Moon will split
	asunder,&quot; the whole following theme becomes disjointed. It will
	Took like this: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	Hour of Resurrection has drawn near and the Moon will split asunder.
	Yet whatever sign these people may see they turn away and say: `This
	is current magic!' They have denied and followed only their own
	lusts. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Therefore,
	the truth is that the incident of the splitting of the Moon is
	confirmed explicitly by the words of the Qur'an and it is not
	dependent upon the traditions of the Hadith. However, the traditions
	supply its details, and one comes to know when and how it had taken
	place. These traditions have been related by Bukhari, Muslim,
	Tirmidhi, Ahmad, Abu `Uwanah, Abu Da'ud Tayalisi, `Abdur Razzaq, Ibn
	Jarir, Baihaqi, Tabarani, Ibn Marduyah, and Abu Nu'aim Tsfahani with
	many chains of transmitters on the authority of Hadrat `Ali, Hadrat
	`Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Hadrat' Abdullah
	bin `Umar, Hadrat Hudhaifah, Hadrat Anas bin Malik and Hadrat Jubair
	bin Mut`im. Three of these authorities, viz, Hadrat `Abdullah bin
	Mas'ud; Hadrat Hudhaifah, and Hadrat Jubair bin Mut`im, state that
	they were the eye-witnesses of this event; two of them cannot be its
	eye-witnesses, for this event took place before the birth of one
	(i.e. 'Abdullah bin `Abbas) and at a time when the other (i.e.. Anas
	bin Malik) was yet a child. But since both these scholars were
	Companions, obviously they must have reported this event after they
	had heard it from the aged Companions who had direct knowledge of
	it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	information that one gathers from the various traditions is that
	this incident occurred about five years before the Hijrah. It was
	the 14th night of the lunar month; the Moon had just risen when it
	suddenly split and its two parts were seen on either side of the
	hill in front. Then after a moment or so they rejoined. The Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace) at that time was at Mina. He told the
	people to mark it and be witnesses to it. The disbelievers said that
	Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) had worked magic
	on them; therefore, their eyes had been deceived. The other people
	said: &quot;Mnhammad could have worked magic on us but not on all
	the people. Let the people from other places come: we shall ask them
	if they also had witnessed this incident. &quot; When the people
	from other places came, they bore evidence that they also had
	witnessed the same phenomenon. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	traditions which have been related from Hadrat Anas give rise to the
	misunderstanding that the incident of the splitting of the Moon had
	happened twice. But, in the first place, no one else from among the
	Companions has stated this; second, in some traditions of Hadrat
	Anas himself also the words are marratain (twice), and in sane
	firqatain and shaqqatain (two pieces); third, the Qur'an mentions
	only one incident of the Moon's splitting asunder. The correct view
	therefore is that this incident happened only once. As for the
	stories which are current among the people that the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) had matte a gesture towards the Moon and it
	split into two parts and that one part of the Moon entered the
	breast of the garment of the Holy Prophet and went out of the
	sleeve, have no basis whatever. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, the
	question arises: What was the real nature of this incident. Was it a
	miracle that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) performed on the
	demand of the disbelievers of Makkah as a proof of his Prophethood?
	Or, was it only an accident that occurred on the Moon by the power
	of Allah and the Holy Prophet had only called the peoples attention
	to it and warned them to mark it as a Sign of the possibility and
	nearness of Resurrection? A large group of the Muslim scholars
	regards it as among the miracles of the Holy Prophet and holds the
	view that it had been shown on the demand of the disbelievers. But
	this view is based only on somc of those traditions which have been
	related from Hadrat Anas. Apart from him no other Companion has
	stated this. According to Fath al Bari Ibn Hajar says: &quot;Apart
	from the narration by Hadrat Anas, in no other narration of this
	story have I come across the theme that the incident of the
	splitting of the Moon had taken place on the demand of the
	polytheists. (Bab Inshiqaq al-Qamar). Abu Nu'aim Isfahani has
	related a tradition on this subject in Dale il an-Nubuwwat, on the
	authority of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas also, but it has a weak
	chain of transrmitters and none of the traditions that have been
	related with strong chains of tranamitters in the collections of
	Hadith on the authority of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas, contains any
	mention of this. Furthermore, neither Hadrat Anas nor Hadrat
	`Abdullah bin `Abbas was a contemporary of this incident. On the
	contrary, none of the Companions from among Hadrat `Abdullah bin
	Mas'ud, Hadrat Hudhaifah, Hadrat Jubair bin Mut`im, Hadrat 'Ali,
	Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Umar, who were contemporaries of the incident,
	has stated that the pagans of Makkah had demanded a Sign of the Holy
	Prophet to testify to his Prophethood on which he might havc shown
	the miracle of the splitting of the Moon. Above all, the Qur'an
	itself also is presenting this event not as a Sign of the
	Prophethood but as a Sign of the nearness of Resurrection. However,
	this was indeed conspicuous proof of the Holy Prophet's truthfulness
	because it testified to the news that he was giving to the people of
	the coming of Resurrection. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	critics raise two kinds of objections against it. In the first
	place, they say it is impossible that a great sphere like the Moon
	should split asunder into two distinct parts, which should get
	hundreds of miles apart and then rejoin. Secondly, they say if it
	had so happened, it would be a well-known event in the world and
	would have found mention in the books of History and Astronomy. But,
	in fact, both these objections are flimsy. As for the discussion of
	its possibility, it could perhaps find credibility in the ancient
	days but on the basis of what man has cane to know in the present
	day about the structure of the planets, it can be said that it is
	just possible that a sphere may burst because of its internal
	volcanic action and its two parts may be thrown far apart by the
	mighty eruption, and then may rejoin under the magnetic force of
	their center. As for the second objection, it is flimsy because the
	event had taken place suddenly and lasted a short time only. It was
	not necessary that at that particular moment the world might be
	looking at the Moon. There was no explosion either that might have
	attracted the people's attention; there was no advance information
	of it that the people might be awaiting its occurrence and looking
	up at the sky. It could not also be seen everywhere on the earth but
	only in Arabia and the eastern (ands where the Moon had risen and
	was visible at that time. The taste and art of writing history also
	had not yet developed so that the people who might have witnessed
	it, should have made a record of it and then sane historian might
	have gathered the evidence and preserved it in some book of History.
	However, in the Histories of Malabar mention has been made of a
	native ruler who had witnessed this phenomenon that night. As for
	the books of Astronomy and Calendars, this event might have been
	mentioned in them only if the event had affected the movement of the
	Moon, its orbit and the times of its rising and setting. As no such
	thing happened, it did not attract the ancient astronomers'
	attention. The observatories also were not so developed that they
	might have taken notice of everything happening in the heavens and
	preserved a record of it.</P>

	warning,&quot; but in our opinion the preferable meaning is that the
	Ark was left as a sign of warning. Its resting and existence on a
	high mountain continued to warn the later generations of the wrath
	of God for thousand of years and kept on reminding them how the
	people who had disobeyed God on this earth had met their down, and
	how the believers had been rescued from it. Imam Bukhari, Ibn Abi
	Hatim, 'Abdur Razzaq and Ibn Jarir have related traditions on the
	authority of Qatadah saying that at the time the Muslims conquered
	'Iraq and al-Jazirah, this Ark still existed on Mount Judi (and
	according to a tradition, near the settlement of Baqirda), and the
	early Muslims had seen it. In the modern times also some people
	during their flights in the airplanes have sighted an Ark-like
	object on a peak in this region, which is suspected to be the Ark of
	Noah, and on the basis of the same expeditions have been sent from
	time to time to search it out. (For further details, see E.N. 47 of
	AI-A'raf, E.N. 46 of Hud, and E.N. 25 of AI-Ankabut ). &nbsp;

	people have misconstrued the words Yassarnal-Qur an to mean that the
	Qur'an is an easy Book; no knowledge is required to understand it so
	much so that a person even without the knowledge of the Arabic
	language, can write a commentary on it, and can deduce any
	injunctions he likes from its verses independent of the Hadith and
	Islamic Law, whereas the context in which these words occur,
	indicates that they are meant to make the people realize this: &quot;One
	means of the admonition are the dreadful torments that descended
	upon the rebellious nations, and the other means is this Qur'an,
	which guides you to the right path by argument and instruction.
	Obviously, this means of admonition is by far the easier one; then,
	why don't you take advantage of it and insist on meeting with the
	torment instead? It is indeed Allah's bounty that He has sent this
	Book through His Prophet and is warning you that the ways you are
	following lead only to destruction and your well-being lies only in
	following this way. This method of admonition has been adopted so
	that you are rescued even before you fall into the pit of
	destruction. Now, who could be more foolish than the one who does
	not believe in the admonition and realizes his error only after he
	has fallen into the pit?&quot;

	is, on a day the ill luck of which continued to rage for several
	days. In Surah Ha Mim As-Sajdah: 16, the words are: fi ayyam in
	nahisat: &quot;in a few ill-omened days,&quot; and in Surah
	AI-Haqqah: 7, it has been said: &quot;This wind storm continued to
	rage for seven nights and eight days. &quot;It is said that the day
	on which the storm started was Wednesday. From this the idea spread
	that Wednesday was a day of ill-luck, and no work should be started
	on this day. Some very weak traditions also have been cited to
	support this view, which have further strengthened the idea that
	this day is ill-omened. For example, there is Ibn Marduyah and
	Khatib al-Baghdadi's tradition that the last Wednesday of the month
	is ill-omened, the ill-omen of which is endless. Ibn Jauzi regards
	this tradition as fabricated and Ibn Rajab as unauthentic Hafiz
	Sakhavi; says that all the methods through which this tradition has
	been reported, are weak. Likewise, Tabarani's tradition (&quot;Wednesday
	is a day of perpetual ill-luck&quot;) also has been declared as weak
	by the scholars of Hadith. In some other traditions one is also
	forbidden to start a journey, to do business transactions, to pare
	the nails, or to visit the sick on a Wednesday. They also say that
	leprosy starts on this day. But all these traditions are weak and
	these cannot be made the basis of any belief. The scholar Munawi
	says: 'To abandon Wednesday taking it as ill-omened and to entertain
	the astrologer's whims in this regard is forbidden, strictly
	forbidden, for all days belong to Allah; no day is beneficial by
	itself nor harmful.&quot; 'Allama Alusi says: 'All days are equal;
	Wednesday has no peculiarity about it. There is no hour in the night
	or day which might be good for one person and bad for another. It is
	Allah Who creates favorable conditions for some people and adverse
	for others.

	nation, but should have descended from above, or sent from another
	land, and if nothing else, he should at least have been a rich man,
	whose extraordinary splendor should make the people believe why
	Allah had selected him alone for the leadership of the nation. This
	same was the error of ignorance in which the disbelievers of Makkah
	were involved. They also refused to acknowledge the Prophet Muhammad
	(Upon Whom be Allah's peace and blessings) as a Prophet on the
	ground that he was a man who moved about in the streets like the
	common men, had been born among them only . the other day and now

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When

	Prophet Lot. When the people saw such handsome guests in Lot's house
	they rushed to it and demanded that they be handed over to them for
	tile gratification of their lust. The Prophet Lot implored them to
	desist from their evil intention, but they did not listen and tried
	to enter his house to take hold of the guests forcibly. At this
	stage suddenly their eyes were blinded. Then the angels told Lot
	that he and his Household should leave the city before dawn; then as
	soon as they had left a dreadful torment descended on the people. In
	the Bible also this event has been described. The words are: 'And
	they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the
	door. But the men (i.e. the angels) put forth their Hand and pulled
	Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door. And they smote the
	nun that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small
