<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although
it could not be known from any authentic traditions, yet one feels
after a study of its subject matter that this Surah might have been
sent down consecutively after Ha-Miim As Sajdah, for it seems to be,
in a way, a supplement to it. This will become clear to every person
who first studies Surah Ha-Mim As Sajdah carefully and then goes
through this Surah. He will see that in that Surah the Quraish chiefs
had been taken to tack for their deaf and blind opposition so that
anyone in Makkah and in its out-skirts, who had any sense of morality
and nobility left in him, should know how unreasonably the chiefs of
the people were opposing Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace), and
as against them, how serious he was in everything he said, how
rational was his standpoint and how noble his character and conduct.
Immediately after that warning this Surah was sent down, which did
full justice to teaching and instruction, and made the truth of the
Holy Prophet's message plain in such an impressive way that anyone
who had any element of the love of the truth in him and who had not
been blinded by the errors of ignorance, could not help being
influenced by it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

and Subject Matter</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
discourse begins in a way as if to say:&quot;Why are you expressing
surprise and amazement at what Our Prophet is presenting before
you?What he says is not new or strange, nor anything novel, which
might have been presented for the first time in history: that
Revelation should come down to a man from God and he should be given
instructions for the guidance of mankind. Allah has been sending
similar Revelations with similar instructions to the former Prophets
before this. It is not surprising that the Owner of the Universe
should be acknowledged as Deity and Ruler, but what is strange is
that one should accept another as divine and deity in spite of being
His subject and slave. You are being angry with him who is presenting
Tauhid before you, where as the shirk that you are practicing with
regard to the Master of the Universe is such a grave crime as may
cause the heavens to break asunder. The angels are amazed at this
boldness of yours and fear that the wrath of Allah might descend on
you any moment.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this the people have been told that a person's being appointed to
Prophethood and his presenting himself as a Prophet does not mean
that he has been made master of the people's destinies and he has
come to the world with that very claim. Allah has kept the destinies
in His own hand. The Prophet has come only to arouse the heedless and
guide the strayed ones to the Right Path. To call to account those
who do not listen to him and to punish or not to punish them is
Allah's own responsibility. and not part of the Prophet's work.
Therefore, they should take it out of their head that the Prophet has
come with a claim similar to those that are made by their so called
religious guides and saints to the effect that he who would not
listen to them, or would behave insolently towards them, would be
burnt to death: In this very connection, the people have also been
told that the Prophet has not come to condemn them but he is their
well wisher; he is warning them that the way they are following will
only lead to their own destruction. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
an answer has been given to the question: Why didn't Allah make all
human beings righteous by birth, and why did He allow the difference
of viewpoint owing to which the people start following each and every
way of thought and action?The answer given is this: Owing to this
very fact has it become possible for man to attain to the special
mercy of Allah, which is not meant for other dumb creatures, but is
only meant for those endowed with power and authority, who should
take Allah as Patron and Guardian not instinctively but consciously
by willing choice. Allah supports the man who adopts this way and
guides and helps him to do good and right and admits him into His
special mercy. On the contrary, the man who misuses his option and
makes his patron those who are not, in fact, the guardians, and
cannot be, are deprived of divine mercy. In this connection, it has
also been made clear that only Allah is the Patron of man and of all
other creatures. Others are neither the patron nor have the power to
do full justice to patronage. Man's success depends only on this that
he should make no mistake in choosing a patron for himself by the use
of his free choice, and should take only Him his Guide Who, in
reality, is the real Patron. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">After
this, it has been explained what the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Din</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

the right to give Man Faith (</FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Din</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">)
and Law (system of belief and practice) and judge the disputes of man
and tell what is Truth and what is falsehood. No other being has any
right whatever to be man's lawgiver. In other words, like the natural
sovereignty, the sovereignty with regard to lawmaking also is vested
only in Allah. No man or creature, apart from Allah, can be the
bearer of this sovereignty. And if a person does not recognize and
accept this Divine rule of Allah, it is merely futile for him to
recognize the natural sovereignty of Allah. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">(True Religion) for Man from the very
beginning. It was one and the same Religion that was vouchsafed in
every age to all the Prophets. No Prophet ever founded any separate
religion of his own. The same one Religion has been enjoined by Allah
for all Mankind since the beginning of creation, and all the Prophets
have been following it and inviting others to follow it. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
Religion and Creed was not sent so that man may rest content only
with believing in it, but it was sent with the purpose and intention
that it alone should be introduced, established and enforced in the
world, and no man made religion be made to prevail in Allah's earth
apart from His Religion. The Prophets had not been appointed only to
preach this Religion but to establish it particularly in the world. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
same was the original Religion of mankind, but after the death of the
Prophets, selfish people created new creeds by creating schisms for
vested interests due to self conceit, vanity and ostentation. All the
different religions and creeds found in the world today have resulted
from corruption of the original Divine Truth. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now,
the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace,) has been sent
so that he may present before the people the same and original
Religion in place of the various practices and artificial creeds and
man made religions, and may try to establish the same. On this, if
instead of being grateful, you feel angry and come out to fight him,
it is your folly; the Prophet will not abandon his mission only
because of your foolishness. He has been enjoined to adhere to his
faith at all costs and to carry out the mission to which he has been
appointed. Therefore, the people should not cherish any false hope
that in order to please thee he would cater to the same whims and
superstitions of ignorance which has corrupted Allah's Religion
before. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">You
do not understand how great an impudence it is against Allah to adopt
a man made religion and law instead of the Religion and Law enjoined
by Allah. You think it is an ordinary thing and there is nothing
wrong with it. But in the sight of Allah it is the worst kind of

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">and a grave crime whose punishment
will be imposed on all those who enforced their own religion on
Allah's earth and those who adopted and followed their religion. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thus,
after presenting a clear and visible concept of Religion it is
said:&quot;The best possible method that could be employed for your
instruction and for bringing you to the Right Path has already been
employed. On the one hand, Allah has sent down His Book, which is
teaching you the truth in a most impressive way in your own language;
and on the other, the lives of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom
be Allah's peace) and his Companions are present before you by which
you can see for yourselves what kind of men are prepared by the
guidance given in this Book. Even then if you do not accept this
guidance, nothing else in the world can bring you to the Right Path.
The only alternative, therefore, is that you should be allowed to
persist in the same error in which you have remained involved for
centuries, and made to meet with the same doom which has been
destined by Allah for such wrongdoers.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">While
stating these truths, brief arguments have been given, here and
there, for </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Tauhid</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">and the Hereafter, the world
worshipers have been warned of the evil consequences and their
punishment in the life hereafter, and the disbelievers have been
criticized for the moral weaknesses, which were the real cause of
their deviation from the truth. The Surah has been concluded with two
important themes. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First,
that the Holy Prophet was wholly unaware of this concept of the
&quot;Book&quot; or the True Faith during the first forty years of
his life and then his sudden appearance before the people with those
two things, is a manifest proof of his being a Prophet. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Secondly,
his presenting his own teaching as the teaching of God does not mean
that he claims to have spoken to God, face to face, but God has
conveyed to him this Guidance, as in the case of all other Prophets,
in three ways: He speaks to His Prophets either through Revelation,
or from behind a veil, or He sends an angel with the message. This
thing was clarified so that the opponents did not have an opportunity
of accusing the Holy Prophet of claiming to have spoken to God, face
to face, and the lovers of the truth should know by what methods
Allah gave instruction to the man whom He had appointed to the
mission of Prophethood. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	style of the opening verses by itself shows that in the background
	there are the misgivings, wonder and amazement which were being
	expressed at that time in every assembly, every meeting place, every
	street and every house and shop of Makkah at the message of the Holy
	Prophet and the themes of the Qur'an. The people said, &quot;Where
	from is this man bringing us new revelations everyday? The like of
	these we had never heard nor seen before. How strange that he
	rejects as false the religion that our forefathers have been
	following in the past, the religion that is still being followed by
	all of us, and the traditions and ways that have been prevalent in
	the country for so many centuries; and he says that the religion
	that he presents only is right and true.&quot; They said: `Had he
	presented even this new religion in a way as to substitute some of
	the falsehood he found in the ancestral paganism and prevalent
	customs with certain others which might be the result of his own
	thought, there could be a dialogue with him. But he says that what
	he recites is Divine Word. How can we accept this? Does God visit
	him, or does he visit God? Or does some dialogue take place between
	him and God?&quot; It is in the background of such expression of
	wonder and doubt that although the address is apparently directed to
	the Holy Prophet, the disbelievers have in fact been told: &quot;Yes:
	these very things are being revealed by the Almighty, All-Wise
	Allah, and with the same themes has its Revelation been coming down
	to all the former Prophets.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Lexically,
	wahi means &quot;swift and secret instruction&quot;, i.e. an
	inspiration which is made with such haste and speed that none may
	know it except the inspirer and the one being inspired. As a term
	this word has been used for the guidance and instruction that is put
	in the mind of a man by Allah like a flash of lightning. What is
	meant to be said here is this: `There is no question of Allah's
	visiting somebody or somebody's visiting Allah and speaking face to
	face with Him. He is All-Mighty and All-Wise. Whenever He pleases to
	have a contact with a servant for the guidance and instruction of
	mankind, nothing can obstruct His will and intention, for He adopts
	the method of revelation for the purpose by His wisdom. &quot; This
	very theme has been repeated in the last verses of the Surah with
	greater clarity and detail.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As to the
	people's objection that the Holy Prophet was presenting strange and

	background in which these verses were sent down. The foremost basis
	of the objections of the people who were expressing wonder and
	doubts against the Holy Prophet and the Qur'an was that he was
	inviting them to Tauhid and they were being alarmed at this and
	saying that if Allah alone is the Creator, Sustainer and Ruler, what
	would be the position of their saints and holy men? At this it has
	been said: &quot;This whole Universe belongs to Allah. How can
	therefore the godhead of another work and operate in the kingdom of
	the real Sovereign, particularly when those others whose godhead is
	acknowledged, are themselves also His subjects?&quot; Then, it has

	another regarded as fulfiller of the needs and the answerer of the

	another taken as the maintainer of the entire world, and his
	devotees should start proclaiming that their holy saint heard the
	prayer of everyone at all places at all times and Games to his help

	is watching them&quot;: Allah sees whatever they arc doing and is
	recording their conduct. It is His responsibility to call them to
	account and punish them. As for the words &quot;You are not
	responsible for their conduct&quot;, these have been addressed to
	the Holy Prophet. They mean: &quot;Their destiny has not been placed
	under yow control so that you may burn to ashes anyone who does not
	listen to you, or depose him from power, or annihilate him.&quot;
	This, however, does not mean that, God forbid, the Holy Prophet
	regarded himself as such, and this was said in order to remove his
	misunderstanding or self-conceit, but this was meant for the
	disbelievers. Although apparently the Holy Prophet himself is the
	addressee, the real object is to tell the disbelievers that the
	Prophet of Allah has made no such claims as were usually made by
	their so-called saints who posed to possess great spiritual powers.
	Among the ignorant people it is generally thought that the so-called
	&quot;holy men&quot; have the power to ruin the destiny of anyone
	who behaves insolently towards them in any way; so much so that even
	after their death if somebody happened to dishonor their grave, or
	if nothing else, only nursed an evil thought about them in his mind,
	they destroyed him completely. Such a thought is in most casts
	spread by the &quot;holy men&quot; themselves. As for the good men
	who do not themselves say any such thing, their names are exploited
	by some other clever people, who spread such thoughts about them in
	order to promote their business. In any case this is regarded as a
	necessary corollary of spirituality and piety among the common
	people that one should possess the powers of making and marring
	destinies. To destroy the spell of this same fraud, Allah is
	addressing His Holy Messenger, as if to tell the disbelievers: &quot;You
	are no doubt Our Messenger and We have blessed you with Our
	Revelations, but yow duty is only to guide the people to the Right
	Path. Their destinies have not boon placed under yow control; they

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote11sym" HREF="#sdfootnote11anc">11</A>This
	theme has three objects in this context: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, it
	is meant to instruct and console the Holy Prophet, as if to say: &quot;Do
	not grieve so much at the ignorance and deviation of the
	disbelievers of Makkah and their stubbornness and obduracy. It is
	Allah's will that man should be granted the freedom of choice and
	action: then whoever desires to have guidance should be given
	guidance, and whoever wants to remain. astray should be allowed to
	go astray. Had this not been Allah's will, there was no need
	whatever of sending the Prophets and the Book; for this only a
	creative hint of Allah Almighty's was enough: all human beings would
	have become as obedient as the rivers, mountains, trees, stones, and
	all other creatures. &quot; (In this connection, please also see
	AI-An'am: 35-36, 107). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	its addressees arc all those people who were involved in the
	confusion, and even now are, that if Allah really had wanted to show
	guidance to human beings and He did not like the differences of
	creed and practice that were prevalent among the people, and wanted
	to have the people adopt the way of the Faith and Islam, there was
	no need of the Revelation and the Book and the Prophethood. He could
	have easily achieved this object by creating everyone a believer and
	Muslim by birth. Another result of this confusion was also this
	reasoning: &quot;When Allah has not done so, the different ways that
	we are following, are approved by Him, and whatever we are doing, is
	according to His wilt. Therefore, nobody has any right to object to
	it. &quot; (To remove this misunderstanding also this theme has been
	mentioned at several places in the Qur'an. Please see Al-An'am: 112,
	137, 148-149; Yunus : 99; Hud: 118-119; An-Nahl: 9, 35 and the
	relevant E.N.'s). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly,
	its object is to make the believers realize the truth about the
	difficulties that one generally faces in the way of preaching
	religion and reforming the people. Those people who do not
	understand the reality of the God, given freedom of choice and will
	and of the resulting differences of temperament and methods,
	sometimes become despondent at the slow progress of the reformatory
	work and wish that some supernatural things should appear from
	Allah, which should change the hearts of the people, and are
	sometimes inclined to adopt unsound methods of bringing about
	reformation, owing to excessive enthusiasm. (For this object also
	this theme has occurred at some places in the Qur'an, for which see
	Ar-Ra'd: 31, An-Nahl: 91-93). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">To
	highlight these objects a very important theme has been expressed in
	these brief sentences. Allah's real vicegerency in the world and His
	Paradise in the Hereafter is not an ordinary blessing, which may be
	distributed over creatures of the rank of the earth and stones and
	donkeys and horses as a common blessing. This is indeed a special
	blessing and a blessing of a very high order for which even the
	angels were not considered fit. That in why Allah created man as a
	creature endowed with power and authority and placed vast means of
	His earth under his control and blessed him with these special
	powers so that he may pass through the test, success in which alone
	can entitle a servant to His blessings. This blessing, is Allah's
	own; no one has a monopoly over it, nor can anyone claim to have it
	on the basis of a personal right, nor has anyone the power to take
	it by force. He who presents service before Allah, who takes Him as
	his Guardian and comes under His protection, alone can have it. Then
	Allah blesses him with help, guidance and grace to pass this test,
	so that he may enter His Mercy. As for the unjust Man who turns away
	from Allah Himself and instead takes others as his patrons,
	Allah-Has no need that he should become his guardian by force. And
	the others whom He takes as his guardians do not possess any
	knowledge and power and authority that they may enable him to
	achieve success by dint of their guardianship of him.&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote12">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote12sym" HREF="#sdfootnote12anc">12</A>That
	is, &quot;Guardianship is not a thing of one's personal choice and
	satisfaction that one may take anyone one may please as one's
	guardian, and the other may also become ones real and true guardian
	and may do full justice to the function of guardianship. This is an
	actual reality, which does not change with the whims of the people;
	the Guardian is He Who is really the Guardian, whether someone
	regards and acknowledges Him as his Guardian or not, and the one who
	is not in reality the ,guardian is not the guardian, no matter
	whether someone continues to regard and acknowledge him as his
	guardian till the last moment. Now, as for the question: What is the
	proof of only Allah's being the real Guardian and of no one else's
	being the guardian? the answer is: Man's real Guardian can be the
	one who changes death into life, who has created a living man by
	breathing life into inorganic substances, and who also possesses the
	powers and authority to do full justice to the function of
	Guardianship. If there is such a one, apart from Allah, he may be
	made the guardian, and if He is Allah alone, then taking another
	beside Him as one's guardian is nothing but ignorance and folly and
	self-destruction.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote13">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote13sym" HREF="#sdfootnote13anc">13</A>From
	here to the end of verse 12, though the whole discourse is a
	Revelation from Allah, the speaker is not Allah but the Holy
	Messenger of Allah. In other words, Allah Almighty is telling His
	Prophet to make this proclamation to the people. Such themes in the
	Qur'an sometimes begin with qul (say, O Prophet) and sometimes
	without it. only the style indicates that the speaker at a place is
	not Allah but Allah's Messenger. Even at some places though the
	words are Allah's, the speaker arc the believers, as for example in
	Surah AI-Fatihah; or, the speaker are the angels as in Surah Maryam:
	64-65.&nbsp; 
	</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote14">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote14sym" HREF="#sdfootnote14anc">14</A>This
	is the natural and logical demand of Allah Almighty's being the
	Master of the Universe and His being the real Guardian. When
	Sovereignty and Guardianship belong to Him only inevitably He alone
	is also the Ruler, and it is for Him to judge human beings' mutual
	disputes and differences. Those who restrict it only to the
	Hereafter make a mistake. There is no argument to prove that Allah's
	position as a Ruler has no effect in this world but is meant only
	for the life hereafter. Likewise, those who restrict it only to
	beliefs and a few questions of &quot;religious nature&quot; are also
	in the wrong. The words arc general and they clearly proclaim Allah
	as having the sole right to judge all disputes and differences.
	According to them, just as Allah is the Master of the Day of
	Judgment in the Hereafter; so He is the best of Judges in this world
	too; and just as He is the Settler of the differences pertaining to
	beliefs as to what is the Truth and what is falsehood, so also in
	legal matters He is the Settler of differences as to what is pure
	for man and what is impure. what is lawful and desirable for him and
	what is forbidden and undesirable, what is evil and vicious in
	morals and what is good and virtuous, what arc the rights of the
	people in their mutual dealings and what are the right practices in
	social political and economic life and what arc wrong. On this very
	basis the Qur'an has declared this principle as the fundamental of
	law: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;If
	there arises any dispute between you about anything, refer it to
	Allah and the Messenger. &quot; (An-Nisa: 59). And: &quot;It does
	not behoove a believing man and a believing woman that when Allah
	and His Messenger have given their verdict in a matter, they should
	exercise an option in that matter of theirs.&quot; (AI-Ahzab: 36).
	And: &ldquo;O people, follow what has been sent down to you from
	your Lord and do not follow other patrons beside Him.&quot;
	(AI-A'raf: 3). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then, in
	the context in which this verse has occurred, it gives another
	meaning also and it is: 'To decide differences is not only Allah's
	legal right on accepting or rejecting which depends man's being a
	believer or an unbeliever, but Allah, in fact, practically also is
	deciding between the truth and falsehood due to which falsehood and
	its worshipers are ultimately being destroyed and the truth and the
	faithful are being honored and exalted, no matter how delayed the
	enforcement of this decision may seem to be. This theme occurs in
	verse 24 below, and has been expressed at several places above in
	the Qur'an. For this please see Ar-Ra'd: 17, 41; Ibrahim: 24-27;
	Bani Isra'il 81; AI-Anbiya': 18, 44; and the E N.'s.&nbsp;

	the same thing as already mentioned in the first verse has been
	further elaborated. It clearly states that Muhammad (upon whom be
	Allah's peace) is not the founder of any new religion, nor was any
	of the Prophets a founder of a separate religion, but it has been
	one and the same Religion which all the Prophets have been
	presenting from Allah from the very beginning, and the same is being
	presented by Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace). In this regard,
	the first name mentioned is of the Prophet Noah, who was the first
	Prophet after the Flood. After him the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon
	whom be Allah's peace) has been mentioned, who is the last of the
	Prophets; then the Prophet Abraham has been mentioned, whom the
	Arabs acknowledged as their guide, and last of all, the Prophets
	Moses and Jesus have been mentioned to whom the Jews and the
	Christians attribute their religions. This does not mean that only
	these five Prophets had been enjoined this Religion, but what is
	meant to be said is that all the Prophets who came to this world,
	brought one and the same Religion and the names of the five
	illustrious Prophets have been mentioned only as examples through
	whom the world received the most well known codes of Divine Law. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As this
	verse throws important light on Din (Religion) and its aim, it is
	necessary that we should study it to understand it well. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Lexically,
	the word shara'a in shara'a !a kum (ordained for you) means to make
	the way. As a term it implies appointing a way, a code and a rule.
	Accordingly , in Arabic the words tashri' ` and shari'at and shari'
	arc understood as the synonyms of legislation and law and law giver
	respectively. This Divine legislation, in fact, is the natural and
	logical result of the fundamental truths which have been stated in
	verses l, 9 and 10 above: that Allah alone is the Owner of
	everything in the Universe, and He alone is man's real Guardian and
	it is for Him to judge the disputes that arise between human beings.
	Now, when Allah alone is the Owner and Guardian and Ruler,
	inevitably He alone is entitled to make the code of law for man and
	it is His responsibility that He should give this code of law to
	man. So, He has carried out His responsibility like this. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then the
	words min-ad-din (of the nature of din) denote that the way
	appointed by Allah is legislation pertaining to din. If the
	explanation of the word din that we have given in E.N. 3 of Surah
	Zumar above, is kept in view, there can be no difficulty in
	understanding that din means nothing but acknowledging the
	sovereignty and leadership of someone and obeying his commands. And
	when this word is used in the meaning of the way, it implies the way
	which man must regard as obligatory for himself to follow and the
	one appointing it as the one whom he ought to obey. On this basis,
	calling God-appointed Way as legislation pertaining to din clearly
	means that it is not merely recommendatory in nature or a mere
	counsel, but it is a law enjoined by the Master, which must
	necessarily be obeyed by the servants and disobedience of which is
	tantamount to rebellion, and the one who does not obey it, in fact,
	denies Allah's being the Sovereign and Ruler and his own position of
	a servant. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then, it
	has been said that this legislation which pertains to din is the
	same as was enjoined on Noah. Abraham and Moses (peace be upon them
	all) and the same now has been enjoined on Muhammad (upon whom be
	Allah's peace). This contains several points: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	Allah did not send this legislation of His directly to every man,
	but appointed Whenever He deemed proper and necessary a person as
	His Messenger and consigned the legislation w him; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	this legislation has been the same from the beginning: it did not so
	happen that in one age one particular din was appointed for a
	nation, and in another age another and contradictory din was sent
	for another nation. Allah did not send many dins but on every
	occasion He sent one and the same din; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) that
	it is an essential part of this din to acknowledge the apostleship
	of those men through whom the legislation has been sent and the
	Revelation in which the legislation has been couched, besides
	acknowledging the Sovereignty of Allah; and it is the demand of
	reason and logic too, that it should be a necessary part of it, for
	a man cannot obey this legislation at all unless he is satisfied
	that it is authentically from Allah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Then it
	has been said that the Prophets were given this legislation
	pertaining to din &quot;, with the express instruction: &quot;Aqim-ud-din
	&quot;; &quot;Establish this din&quot;, or &quot;Keep this din
	established,&quot; as variously translated by Shah Waliullah, Shah
	Rafi'uddin and Shah `Abdul Qadir. Both these translations are
	correct, for iqamat means both to establish and to keep established,
	and the Prophets were appointed to perform both the functions. Their
	first duty was to establish this din wherever it was not
	established, and the second that they should keep it established
	after they had established it, or had found it already established
	in a place. Obviously, a thing can be kept established only when it
	has already been established, otherwise the primary requirement
	would be to establish it first, and then make continuous effort to
	keep it established. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, two
	questions arise : First, what is the meaning of establishing the
	din? Second, what is din itself, which we have been enjoined to
	establish and then keep it established? Let us try to understand
	these questions well. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The word
	iqamat (to establish) when used in respect of a material or physical
	object implies causing it to rise from the sitting or lying
	positions or assembling the scattered parts of a thing and raising
	it up high. But when iqamat is used in respect of a thing which is
	not material but spiritual in nature it does not merely imply
	preaching it, but also acting according to it as best as one can,
	introducing it and enforcing it practically. For example, when we
	say that so and-so established his rule, it does not mean that he
	invited others to his government but that he subdued the people of
	the land and organized the different departments of the government
	in a way that the administration of the country began to function
	according to his orders. Similarly, when we say that courts have
	been established in the country, it means that judges have been
	appointed to do justice and they ate hearing the cases and giving
	judgments, and not that hymns in praise of justice arc being sung
	and the people being impressed. Likewise, when the Qur'an enjoins
	the establishment of the Prayer (Salat), it does not imply that one
	should merely preach and exhort others to the Prayer but that one
	should not only perform it oneself, observing all its conditions,
	but should also strive to make arrangement so that it becomes a'
	regular practice among the believers. There should be mosques, there
	should be arrangements for offering the Prayer collectively and for
	the Friday congregational Prayer, and for making calls to the Prayer
	punctually; there should be the Imams to lead the Prayers and the
	scholars to give sermons, and the people should visit the mosques
	regularly and punctually and make offering the Prayer an essential
	part of their daily routine. After this explanation, there should
	remain no difficulty in understanding that when the Prophets were
	enjoined to establish the din and to keep it established, it did not
	simply mean that they. should practice it themselves and not even
	this that they should preach it to others so that the people may
	accept its truth, but also that when the people have accepted it,
	steps should be taken to introduce and enforce the entire din
	practically among them so that they may start living according to it
	for ever afterwards. No doubt preaching is the primary necessary
	stage of this work without which there can be no second stage, but
	every intelligent person can himself see that in this Command
	preaching has not been made the object, but the real object is to
	establish the din and keep it established. Preaching is certainly a
	means to the end but not the end in itself, but nobody can say that
	it was the only and foremost object of the mission of the Prophets. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now, Iet
	us take the second question. When some people saw that the din which
	has been enjoined to be established is common among all the
	Prophets, and their shari'ahs have been different, as Allah Himself
	says: &quot;We appointed for each community among you a law and a
	way of life&quot;, they formed the view that inevitably this din did
	not imply the shari' ah commandments, rules and regulations but only
	the acceptance of Tauhid, the Hereafter and the Book and the
	Prophethood and performance of certain acts of devotion to Allah, or
	at the most, it included some of the major moral principles which
	have been common to all the shari ahs. But this is a superficial
	view, which has been formed after having a cursory glance over the
	unity of religion and the difference of the shari'ahs. This is,
	however, a dangerous view, which if not corrected in time, may well
	lead to the separation between din (religion) and shari'ahs (law).
	It was this very view in, which St. Paul was involved, who presented
	the doctrine of the din (religion) without shari'ah (law), and
	corrupted the community of the Prophet Jesus (peace be upon him).
	For, if shari'ah (law) is something separate from din (religion) and
	the command is only for establishing the din and not the shari'ah,
	inevitably the Muslims also, like the Christians, would regard the
	shari ah as unimportant and overlook its establishment as not being
	the real object by itself, and would remain content with only
	beliefs and a few important moral principles. Instead of determining
	the meaning of din from such speculations, Iet us turn to the Qur'an
	itself and see whether the din which we have . been enjoined here to
	establish unplies the beliefs and a few important moral principles
	only, or the shari'ah values and commandments as well. When we
	explore the Qur'an we find that what it regards as din includes the
	following things as well: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) &quot;And
	the only Command they were given was to worship Allah, making their
	din sincerely His, turning all their attention towards Him, and to
	establish the ,salat and to pay the Zakat.' this alone is the true
	and right din. &quot; (Al-Bayyinah: 5). This shows that the Salat
	and the Zakat are included in this din. whereas the commandments
	.pertaining to both have been different in the different shari ahs.
	No one can say that in all the previous shari ahs the Salat has had
	the same form, the same elements, the same mumber of the rak ahs,
	the same direction of the giblah, the same times and the same other
	commands concerning it. Likewise, no one can claim also about the
	Zakat that in all the shari ahs the same has been the exemption
	limit, the same rates and the same injunctions concerning its
	collection and distribution. But in spite of the difference of the
	shari'ahs, Allah has regarded both these as part of din. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) 'You
	are forbidden carrion and blood, the flesh of swine and of that
	animal which has been slaughtered in any other name than of Allah,
	and of the strangled animal, and of that beaten to death or killed
	by a fall or gored to death or mangled by a beast of prey---save of
	that you duly slaughtered while it was still alive - and of that
	which is slaughtered at (ungodly) shrines. It is also unlawful for
	you to try to find your fortune by means of divining devices, for
	all these things are sinful acts. Today the disbelievers have
	despaired of (vanquishing) your religion; therefore do not fear them
	but fear Me. Today I have perfected your din for you and completed
	My blessing on you and approved Islam as the din (way of life) for
	you.&quot; (Al-Ma'idah: 3). This shows that all these shariah
	commandments are also din. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) Fight
	with those from among the people of the Book, who do not believe in
	Allah nor in the Last Day; who do not make unlawful what Allah and
	His Messenger have made unlawful, and do not adopt the right din as
	their din. &quot; (At-Taubah: 29). This shows that besides belief in
	Allah and the Hereafter it . is also din to accept and follow the
	Commands about the lawful and the unlawful, which have been given by
	Allah and His Messenger. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) &quot;The
	woman and the man guilty of fornication, flog each one of them with
	a hundred stripes, and let not any pity for them restrain you in
	regard to a matter prescribed in the din of Allah, if you believe in
	Allah and the Last Day.&quot; (An-Nur: 2). &quot;It did not behoove
	Joseph to seize his brother by the king's din. &quot; (Yusuf: 76).
	This shows that the criminal law is also din. If a man follows the
	criminal law prescribed by God, he is a follower of God's din and if
	he follows a king's law, he is a follower of the king's din. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These are
	the four specimens in which the shari'ah commandments have been
	described as din in clear words. But, besides these, a careful study
	shows that the eradication of the sins for which Allah has held out
	the threat of Hell (e.g. adultery, taking of interest, killing of a
	believer, consuming the property of the orphan, taking possession of
	the other peoples properties in unlawful ways etc.), and the crimes
	which become the cause of God's torment, e.g. sodomy (the act of
	Lot's people) and dishonesty in business dealings (as practiced by
	the Prophet Shu'aib's people) should necessarily be included in din,
	for if din cannot save one from Hell and Allah's torment, what use
	could it be ? Likewise, those shari'ah commandments also should be
	part of the din violation of which has been regarded as cause of
	entry into the Fire, e.g. injunctions relating to inheritance, after
	stating which it has been said: &quot;And whoever disobeys Allah and
	His Messenger and transgresses the limits prescribed by Him, Allah
	will cast him into the Fire wherein he will have a disgraceful
	torment.&quot; (An-Nisa: 14,). Likewise, the prohibition of those
	things whose prohibition Allah has mentioned with great emphasis and
	absoluteness, e.g. prohibition of the mother, sister and daughter
	and prohibition of wine, theft, gambling, false evidence, etc. if
	not included in the establishment of the din, it would mean that
	Allah has given some unnecessary Commands also, which are not meant
	to be introduced and enforced. Similarly, establishing those things
	which Allah has made obligatory, e g. fasting and pilgrimage; cannot
	be excluded from the establishment of din only on the pretext that
	the 30 fasts of Ramadan had not been enjoined in the previous
	shariah, and pilgrimage to the Ka'bah was enjoined only in the
	Shariah which was inherited by the Ishmaelite branch of the Prophet
	Abraham's progeny. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As a
	matter of fact, the misunderstanding was caused only because the
	verse: &quot;We appointed for each community among you a law and a
	way of life&quot;, has been misconstrued to mean that since the
	shari'ah appointed for every community was separate. and the command
	given was only to establish the din (way of life) which was common
	to all the Prophets, the establishment of the shari ah was not
	included in the establishment of the din, whereas the real meaning
	of this verse is just the opposite of it. If the context (vv. 41-50)
	in which this verse has occurred in Surah AI-Ma'idah is studied
	carefully, it will be seen that the correct meaning of this verse
	is: Whatever shari 'ah was given by Allah to the community of a
	Prophet, was the din for that community, and the establishment of
	the same din was the object during his Prophethood. And since now is
	the period of the Holy Prophet Muhammad's Prophethood, the shariah
	which has been given to the Ummah of Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
	peace) is the din of this time, and to establish the same is to
	establish the din. As for the difference of the shariah, it does not
	mean that the shari 'ahs sent by God were mutually contradictory,
	but it means that in their details there have been some differences
	owing to the different environments, take, for instance, the Prayer
	and the Fast. The Prayer has been obligatory in all the shari'ahs,
	but the qiblah of all the shariahs was not the same, and there was a
	difference in its times and rakahs and elements as well. Likewise,
	the Fast was obligatory in every shari'ah, but the 30 fasts of
	Ramadan were not there in the other shariahs. From this it is not
	correct to conclude that the Prayer and the Fast as such are
	included in the establishment of din but performing the Prayer in a
	particular way and observing the Fast at a particular time is
	excluded from it. However, the correct conclusion that one can draw
	is: To perform the Prayer and observe the Fast according to the
	rules and procedures that had been appointed for the people in the
	shari'ah of every Prophet amounted to establishment of din in his
	time. In the present age the establishment of the din is that these
	acts of worship be performed according to the procedures enjoined in
	the Shari 'ah of the Prophet Muhammad. The same is true about all
	other Shari'ah commandments as well. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Whoever
	studies the Qur'an carefully will see that this Book does not
	envisage that its adherents will live as subjects of the
	disbelievers and will pass a religious lift under them, but it
	openly proclaims that it will have its own rule established; it
	demands from its followers that they should struggle with their
	lives for the intellectual, cultural, legal and political supremacy
	of the true Faith; and it gives them a program for the reformation
	of human life, the major part of which can be acted upon only when
	political power and authority is in the believers' hand. As stated
	by itself, the object of this Book's being sent down is: &quot;We
	have sent down this Book to you with the Truth so that you may judge
	between the people in accordance with the light that Allah has shown
	you. &quot; (An-Nisa: 105). The Commandments given in this Book
	about the collection and distribution of the Zakat expressly
	envisage a government who should be responsible for collecting the
	Zakat and distributing it among the deserving people according to a
	laid down procedure. (At-Taubah;60,103). The prohibition of interest
	that has been enjoined in this Book aad the declaration of war that
	has been made against those who do not abstain from taking interest
	(AI-Baqarah: 27_5-279) can be enforced only when the political and
	economic system of the country is entirely in the believers' hand.
	The Law of Retribution for murder (AI-Baqarah: 178), cutting off of
	the hand for theft (AI-Ma'idah 38) and carrying out of the
	prescribed punishment for adultery and calumny (An-Nur: 2-4) have
	not been enjoined on the assumption that the believers will remain
	subject to the police and courts of the disbelievers. The Command to
	fight the disbelievers (AlBaqarah: 190, 216) has not been given with
	the idea that the followers of this din will carry out this Command
	by getting enlisted in the army of disbelief. The command to take
	Jizyah from the followers of the former Books (At-Taubah: 29) has
	not been given on the assumption that the Muslims will take Jizyah
	from them while being their subjects and will be responsible for
	their protection. And this thing is not true only about the Madinite
	Surahs; in the Makkan Surahs as well a discerning eye can clearly
	see that the scheme envisaged from the very beginning was of Islam's
	supremacy and dominance and not of Islam's and the Muslims'
	subjugation under an un-Islamic rule. See, for instance, Bani
	Isra`il: 76-89; AlQasas: 85-86; Ar-Rum: 1-6; As-Saaffat: 171-179;
	Suad: Introduction, v. 11 and E.N. 12 on it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Above
	all, this misinterpretation clashes with the great work that the
	Holy Prophet himself accomplished during the 23 years of his
	Prophethood. Who can deny the fact that he subdued entire Arabia by
	means of both preaching and the sword and established in it a full
	fledged system of government with a detailed law, covering all
	aspects of life, from beliefs and rites of worship to personal
	conduct, collective morality, culture and civilization, economic and
	social life, politics and judiciary, peace and war. If this entire
	work of the Holy Prophet is not accepted as a commentary of the
	Command of &quot;iqamat din &quot; (establishment of din) which,
	according to this verse, he had been enjoined to undertake like all
	other Prophets, then it could have one of the two meanings: That
	earlier, God forbid, the Holy Prophet should be blamed that he had
	been appointed only to preach and teach beliefs and a few important
	moral rules but he exceeded his mandate and established a government
	of his own whim and laid down a code of law, which was different
	from the common law of the Prophets as well as in excess of it; or
	that Allah should be blamed that after having made the above
	mentioned declaration in Surah Ash-Shura. He went back on His own
	word, and made His Last Prophet do something which was not only much
	over and about and different from the objective of &quot;iqamat din
	&quot; as stated in this Surah but on the completion of this mission
	He also made this declaration, contrary to His first declaration:
	&quot;Today I have perfected your din for you.&quot; (Al-Ma'idah:3).
	May Allah keep us safe from this! Apart from these two, if there is
	any third alternative,, which makes this-interpretation of &quot;iqamat
	din&quot; plausible and also does not lay any blame on Allah or His
	Messenger, we would like to know it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After
	giving the Command for &quot;iqamat din &quot;, the last thing that
	Allah has stated in this verse is this: La tatafarraqu fi-hi: &quot;Do
	not create schisms in the din: Be not divided in it&quot; Creating
	schisms in din implies that one should introduce something new in
	religion for which there exists no sound basis, and then should
	insist that belief and unbelief depend on the acceptance of the
	innovation, and should separate along with those who have accepted
	it from those who have not accepted it. This new thing can be of
	several kinds: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) To
	introduce something entirely new into din; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) to
	exclude from din something which actually belonged to it; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) to
	tamper with the fundamentals of din by misinterpretations and
	introduce new beliefs and novel practices; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) to
	distort the din by making changes of fundamental nature in it, for
	example, by reducing what was important in it to un-important, by
	raising what was at most permissible to the position of imperative
	and obligatory, even to the position of the most fundamental pillar
	of Islam. Owing to such innovations, divisions first appeared in the
	communities of the Prophets; then gradually the creeds of the sects
	developed into wholly separate and mutually exclusive religious
	systems whose followers now do not have any idea that once they all
	belonged to one and the same origin. These divisions have nothing to
	do with the permissible and reasonable difference of opinion which
	naturally takes place among the scholars when they are engaged in
	understanding and studying the injunctions and fundamentals of the
	din for the purpose of deriving and extracting points of law, and
	for which there is room in the words of the Book of Allah itself

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	Allah is Kind and Compassionate to all His servants; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	the measure of His provisions is not the same for everybody, but it
	varies from man to man. Now, in this verse it is being told that
	although the partial differences in kindness and measures of
	Provisions are countless, there is also a difference of fundamental
	nature, which is: there is one kind of the provision for the seeker
	of the Hereafter and of another kind for the seeker of the world. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is a
	very important truth which has been stated here briefly. Let us
	understand it fully, for it helps every man to determine his
	attitude to life. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Both the
	seeker of the Hereafter and the seeker of the world have been
	likened to the farmer in this verse, who labors persistently hard
	right from the time he prepares the soil till the time his crop is
	ready for harvesting. He puts in all his labor so that he may reap
	and gather the crop of the seeds he sowed. But because of the
	difference of the intention and objective and also the difference of
	the attitude and conduct, to a large extent, a vast difference takes
	place between the farmer who sows for the Hereafter and the farmer
	who sows for this world. Therefore, Allah has ordained different
	results and consequences of the labors of each, although the place
	of activity of both is this very earth. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As to the
	farmer who is sowing for the Hereafter, Allah has not said that he
	will get no share from the world. The world, in a more or less
	measure, he will get in any case. for he also has a share in the
	common provisions being bestowed by Allah, and every person, good or
	bad, is getting his sustenance here. But Allah has not given him the
	good news of the harvest of this world but that his harvest of the
	Hereafter will be increased, for he is a seeker of the same, and is
	concerned about his end there There are several ways in which this
	harvest can be increased; for example, as he will go on doing
	righteous deeds with sincere mentions, he will be blessed with the
	grace to do more and more righteous deeds and his breast will be
	opened out for more and more good works. When he will make up his
	mind to adopt pure means for thieving pure aims, he will be blessed
	with pure means only and Allah will not let it so happen that all
	doors to goodness he closed and only doors to evil to remain open
	for him. Above all, his each good work, however small and
	insignificant, will at least be increased ten times over in the
	Hereafter, and there is no limit to this increase. Allah will
	increase it hundreds of thousands of tithes for whomever He may
	please 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the one who is only sowing for this world, and is not at all
	concerned about the Hereafter, Allah has plainly told him of two of
	the results of his labors: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That,
	however hard he may struggle and strive. he will not get the whole

	this that you should develop in yourselves a desire for attaining
	nearness to Allah. That is; you should be reformed. That is my only
	reward. &quot; This commentary has been reported from Hasan Basri
	and a saying of Qatadah also has been cited in support of this: so
	much so that in a tradition by Tabarani this saying has also been
	attributed to Ibn 'Abbas. In the Qur'an itself, at another place,
	this same subject has been treated, thus: &quot;Tell them: I do not
	seek of you any reward for this work: I only ask of the one who
	will. to adopt the way of his Lord.' (AI-Furqan: 57). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	group takes qurba in the meaning of the kindred, and interprets the
	verse to mean this: &quot;I do not seek from you any other reward
	than this that you should love my near and dear ones.&quot; Then,
	some of the commentators of this group interpret 'the kindred&quot;
	to mean alt the children of 'Abdul Muttalib, and some others
	restrict it to Hadrat 'AIi and Fatimah and their children. This
	commentary has been reported from Said bin Jubair and 'Amr bin
	Shu'aib, and in some traditions it has been attributed to Ibn 'Abbas
	and Hadrat 'AIi bin Husain (Zam al-'Abedin), but this interpretation
	cannot be accepted for several reasons. Firstly. when Surah
	Ash-Shura was sent down at Makkah, Hadrat 'AIi and Fatimah had not
	yet been married and, therefore, there could be no question of their
	children. As for the children of 'Abdul Muttalib, they were not all
	following the Holy Prophet but some of them had openly joined with
	his enemies, and the enmity of Abu Lahab is too well known. Second,
	&quot;the kindred&quot; of the Holy Prophet were not only the
	children of 'Abdul Muttalib but he had his kindred among all the
	families of the Quraish through his mother and his father and his
	wife. Hadrat Khadijah. In all these clans he had his best supporters
	as well as his staunch enemies 'Third, and this is the most
	important paint, in view of the high position of a Prophet from
	which he starts his mission of inviting the people towards Allah, it
	does not seem fitting that he would ask the people to love his
	kindred in return for his services in connection with his great
	Mission. No person of fine taste could imagine that Allah would have
	taught His Prophet such a mean thing, and the Prophet would havc
	uttered the same before the Quraish. In the stones that have been
	narrated of the Prophets in the Qur'an, we find that a Prophet after
	a Prophet stands up before his people sad says: &quot;I do not ask
	of you any reward: my reward is with Allah, Lord of the worlds.&quot;
	(Yunus: 72; Hud: 29, 51; Ash-Shu'ara': 109, 127, 145, 164, l80). In
	Surah Ya Sin the criterion given of a Prophet's truthfulness is that
	he gives his invitation without any selfish motive. (v. 21). In the
	Qur'an the Holy Prophet himself has been made to say again and again
	words to the effect: &quot;I demand no reward from you for this
	message. &quot; (Al An'am: 90, Yusuf: 104, Al-Mu'minun: 72,
	Al-Furqan: 57, Saba: 47, Suad: 86, At-Tur; 40, AI Qalam: 46). After
	this, what could be the occasion for the Holy Prophet to tell the
	people that in return for his service of inviting them to Allah,
	they should lout his relatives. Then it seems all the more

	thing has been counted here as the best quality of the believers.
	and has been enjoined in Surah AI-'Imran: 159 On this basis.
	consultation. is an important pillar of the Islamic way of life. and
	to conduct the affairs of collective life without consultation is
	not only the way of ignorance but also an express violation of the
	law prescribed by Allah. When we consider why consultation has been
	given such importance in Islam, three things become obvious: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	that it is injustice that a person should decide a matter by his
	personal opinion and ignore others when it involves the interests of
	two or more persons No one has a right to do , as he likes in
	matters of common interest Justice demands that all those whose
	interests arc involved in a matter be consulted, and if it concerns
	a large number of the people, their reliable representatives should
	be made a party in consultation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Second,
	that a man tries to do what he likes in matters of common interest
	richer because he wants to usurp the rights of others for selfish
	ends, or because he looks down upon others and regards himself as a
	superior person. Morally both These qualities are equally
	detestable, and a believer cannot have even a tinge of either of
	these in himself. A believer is neither selfish so that he should
	get undue benefits by usurping the rights of others, nor he is
	arrogant and self-conceited that he should regard himself as
	all-wist and all-knowing. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Third,
	that it is a grave responsibility to give decisions in matters chat
	involve the tights and interests of others. No one who fears God and
	knows what severe accountability for it he will be subjected to by
	his Lord, can dare take the heavy burden of it solely on himself.
	Such a boldness is shown only by those who arc fearless of God and
	heedless of the Hereafter. The one who fears God and has the feeling
	of the accountability of the Hereafter, will certainly try that in a
	matter of common interest he should consult all the concerned people
	or their authorized representatives so as to reach, as far as
	possible, an objective and right and equitable decision, and if
	there occurs a mistake one man alone should not be held responsible
	for it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A deep
	consideration of these three things can enable one to fully
	understand that consultation is a necessary demand of the morality
	that Islam has taught to man, and departure from it is a grave
	immorality which Islam does not permit The Islamic way of life
	requires that the principle of consultation should be used in every
	collective affair, big or small. If it is a domestic affair, the
	husband and the wife should act by mutual consultation, and when the
	children have grown up, they also should be consulted. If it is a
	matter concerning the whole family, the opinion of every adult
	member be solicited. If it concerns a tribe or a fraternity or the
	population of a city, and it is not possible to consult all the
	people, the decision should be taken by a local council or
	committee, which should comprise the trustworthy representatives of
	the concerned people according to an agreed method. If the matter
	concerns a whole nation, the head of government should be appointed
	by the common consent of the people, and he should conduct the
	national affairs in consultation with the leaders of opinion. whom
	the people regard as reliable, and he should remain at the helm of
	affair only as long as the people themselves want him to remain in
	that position. No honest man can try to assume the headship of a
	nation by force, or desire to continue in that position
	indefinitely, nor can think of corning into power by deception and
	then seek the people's consent by coercion, nor can he devise
	schemes so that the people may elect representatives to act as his
	advisers not by their own free choice but according to his will.
	Such a thing can be desired only by the one who cherishes evil
	intentions, and such a fraud against the Islamic principle of
	consultation can be practiced only by him who dces not feel any
	hesitation in deceiving both God and the people whereas the fact is
	that neither can God be deceived nor the people be so blind as to
	regard the robber, who is committing robbery in the bright day light
	openly, as their well. wisher and servant. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	principle of consultation as enshrined in amru-hum shura baina-hum
	by itself demands five things: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	people whose rights and interests relate to collective matters,
	should have full freedom to express their opinion and they should be
	kept duly informed of how their affairs are being conducted; they
	should also have the full right that if in the conduct of the
	affairs they see an error, a weakness or a deficiency, they can
	check it and voice a protest, and if they do not see any change for
	the better, they can change their rulers. To conduct the people's
	affairs by keeping them silent and un-informed is sheer dishonesty
	which no one can regard as adherence to the principle of
	consultation in Islam. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	person who is to be entrusted with the responsibility of conducting
	the collective affairs, should be appointed by the people's consent,
	and this consent should be their free consent, which is not obtained
	through coercion, temptation, deception, and fraud, because in that
	case it would be no consent at all. A nation's true head is not he
	who becomes its head by trying every possible method, but he whom
	the people make their head by their own free choice and approval. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	people who are appointed as advisers to the head of the state should
	be such as enjoy the confidence of the nation, and obviously the
	people who win representative positions by suppression or by
	expending wealth, or by practicing falsehood and fraud, or by
	misleading the people cannot be regarded as enjoying the confidence
	in the real sense. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	advisers should give opinion according to their knowledge and faith
	and conscience and they should have full freedom of such expression
	of opinion. Wherever this is not the case, wherever the advisers
	give advice against their own knowledge and conscience, under duress
	or temptation, or under party discipline. it will be treachery and
	dishonesty and not adherence to the Islamic principle of
	consultation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) The
	advice that is given by a consensus of the advisers, or which has
	the support of the majority of the people, should be accepted, for
	if a person (or a group of persons) behaves independently and acts
	on his own whims, even after hearing the advice of others,
	consultation becomes meaningless. Allah does not say: &quot;They are
	consulted in their affairs&quot;, but says: &quot;They conduct their
	affairs by mutual consultations&quot; . This instruction is not
	implemented by mere consultation, but for its sake it is necessary
	that the affairs be conducted according to what is settled by
	consensus or by majority opinion in consultation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Along
	with this explanation of the Islamic principle of consultation, this
	basic thing also should be kept in view that this consultation is
	not independent and autocratic in conducting the affairs of the
	Muslims, but necessarily subject to the bounds that Allah Himself
	has set by His legislation, and is subject to the fundamental
	principle: &quot;It is for Allah to give a decision in whatever you
	may differ,&quot; and &quot;if there arises any dispute among you
	about anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger. &quot;
	According to this general principle, the Muslims can hold
	consultations in Shari 'ah matters with a view to determining the
	correct meaning of a text or verse and w find out the ways of
	implementing it so as to fulfill its requirements rightly but they
	cannot hold consultations in order to give an independent judgment
	in a matter which has already been decided and settled by Allah and
	His Messenger.&nbsp;

	provides for man is provided so that he may spend it and not that he
	may set it aside and hoard it up like a miser. The third meaning is
	based on that according to the Qur'an, spending does not mean
	spending merely on one's own self and for one's personal needs, but
	it also contains the meaning of spending for the sake of Allah in
	His way. On account of these three reasons Allah here is counting
	spending of wealth among the best qualities of the believers because
	of which the blessings of the Hereafter have been reserved only for
	them.&nbsp;

	(Al Fath: 27). Besides, several Traditions also mention that the

	enjoined this, or I have been forbidden this.&quot; All such things

	Traditions the way mention has been made of the Commandment of the
	Salat five times a day and the Holy Prophet's making submissions in

	Muhammad (upon whom be His peace and blessings) as had taken place
	between Allah and the Prophet Moses at the foot of Mount Tur. As for
	the third kind, the Qur'an itself testifies that it was conveyed to
