about like carded wool. Then, it has been said that when Allah's
Court is established in the Hereafter and the people are called upon
to account for their deeds. The people whose good deeds are found to
be heavier than their evil deeds, will be blessed with bliss and
happiness, and the people whose good deeds are found to be lighter
than their evil deeds, will be cast into the deep pit full of burning
fire. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>&quot;Qari'ah
	&quot; literally means the &quot;striking one&quot; Qar ` is to
	strike one thing upon another so severely as to produce a noise. In
	view of this literal meaning, the word qari'ah is used for a
	dreadful disaster and a great calamity. At another place in the
	Qur'an this word has been used for a great affliction befalling a
	nation. In Surah Ar-Ra`d 31, it has been said: &quot;As for the
	disbelievers, because of their misdeeds, one affliction or the other
	does not cease to visit them every now and then.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But, here
	the word al-Qari'ah has been for the Resurrection and in Surah
	Al-Haaqqah too the Resurrection has been described by this very
	epithet (v.4). One should remember that here the whole Hereafter,
	from the first stage of Resurrection to the last stage of judgment
	and meting out of rewards and punishments, is being depicted
	together.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>This

	Great Disaster the whole of the present order of the world will be
	overthrown; the people then will be running about in confusion and
	bewilderment like so many scattered moths around a light; and the
	mountains will be flying about like carded wool of different colors.
	The mountains have been compared to wool of different colors because
	of the existence of a variety of colors in them.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote4">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote4sym" HREF="#sdfootnote4anc">4</A>The
	word mawazin in the original can be plural of mauzun as well as, of
	mizan. In the first case, mawazin would imply the deeds which might
	have some weight in the sight of Allah and be, thus, worthy of
	appreciation; in the second case, mawazin would imply scales of a
	balance. In the first case, the meaning of the mawazin's being
	heavier or lighter is that the good deeds will be heavy or light as
	,against the evil deeds, for in the sight of Allah only good deeds
	have any weight and worth. In the second case. the meaning of the
	mawazin's being heavy is that the scale of the good deeds will be
	heavier than the scale of evil deeds, in Allah Almighty's Balance of
	Justice, and their being light means that the scale of good deeds
	will be lighter than the scale of evil deeds. Besides, in Arabic
	idiom the word mizan is also used for weight ( wazan); accordingly,
	the weight's being heavy of light implies the good deeds being heavy
	or light. In any case, whether mawazin is taken in the meaning of
	mauzun or of mizan, or of wazan, the intention remains the same,
	which is that the basis of judgment in the Divine Court will be
	whether the provision of the deeds that a man has brought is weighty
	or weightless, or whether his good deeds are heavier than his evil
	deeds or lighter. This theme has occurred at several places in the
	Qur'an which explains the meaning fully well. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In Surah
	Al-A'raf it has been said: &quot;On that Day the weight will be
	identical with the Truth: accordingly, those whose scales, will be
	heavy will alone come out successful; and those whose scales are
	light will be the ones who will have incurred loss upon themselves.&quot;
	(w. 8-9). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In Surah
	Al-Kahf, it was said: 'O Prophet, say to them: Should we tell you
	who are the most un-successful people and miserable failures in
	regard to their deeds? They are those whose all endeavors in the
	worldly life had gone astray from the Right Way, but they were under
	the delusion that everything they were doing, was rightly directed:
	these are the people who rejected the Revelations of their Lord and
	did not believe that they would ever go before Him. Therefore, all
	their deeds were Lost, for We will assign no weight to them on the
	Day of Resurrection.&quot; (vv. 103-105). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In Surah
	Al-Anbiya': &quot;On the Day of Resurrection, We will set up just
	and accurate balances so that no one will be wronged in the least in
	any way; even if it be an act equal in weight to a grain of mustard
	seed, We will bring it forth (to be weighed) and We suffice for
	reckoning&quot;. (v.47). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These
	verses show that kufr and denial of the truth is in itself such a
	stupendous evil that it will certainly lower the scale of evils, and
	there will be no good act of the disbelievers, which may have any
	weight in the scale of good deeds so that its scale of goodness may
	become heavy. However, in the scales of the believer there will be
	the weight of Faith as well as the weight of the good deeds which he
	performed in the world. On the other hand, every evil done by him
	will be placed in the scale of evil deeds and then it will be seen
	whether his scale of the good deeds is heavier or his scale of the
	evil deeds.&nbsp;

	falls. Hell has been called Hawiyah because it will be very deep and
	the culprits will be thrown into it from the height. As for the
	words, &quot;his mother will be Hawiyah&quot; they mean: Just as the
