contents show that it was revealed at the stage when persecution of

theme is to affirm the meting out of rewards and punishments in the
Hereafter, which the people of Makkah were not prepared to
acknowledge, Let us consider the reasoning in the order in which it
has been presented. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First
of all, swearing oaths by the dawn, the ten nights, the even and the
odd, and the departing night, the listeners have been asked: &quot;Are
these things not enough to testify to the truth of that which you are
refusing to acknowledge?&quot; From the explanation that we have
given of these four things in the corresponding notes, it will become
clear that these things are a symbol of the regularity that exists in
the night and day, and swearing oaths by these the question has been
asked in the sense: Even after witnessing this wise system
established by God, do you still need any other evidence to show that
it is not beyond the power of that God Who has brought about this
system to establish the Hereafter, and that it is the very
requirement of his wisdom that He should call man to account for his
deeds? </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
reasoning from man's own history, the evil end of the Ad and the
Thamud and Pharaoh has been cited as an example to show that when
they transgressed all limits and multiplied corruption in the earth,
Allah laid upon them the scourge of His chastisement. This is a proof
of the fact that the system of the universe is not being run by deaf
and blind forces, nor is the world a lawless kingdom of a corrupt
ruler, but a Wise Ruler is ruling over it, the demand of Whose wisdom
and justice is continuously visible in the world itself in man's own
history that He should call to account, and reward and punish
accordingly, the being whom He has blessed with reason and moral
sense and given the right of appropriation in the world. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this, an appraisal has been made of the general moral state of human
society of which Arab paganism was a conspicuous example; two aspects
of it in particular, have been criticized: first the materialistic
attitude of the people on account of which overlooking the moral good
and evil, they regarded only the achievement of worldly wealth, rank
and position, or the absence of it, as the criterion of honor or
disgrace, and had forgotten that neither riches was a reward nor
poverty a punishment, but that Allah is trying man in both conditions
to see what attitude he adopts when blessed with wealth and how he
behaves when afflicted by poverty. Second, the people's attitude
under which the orphan child in their society was left destitute on
the death of the father. Nobody asked after the poor; whoever could,
usurped the whole heritage left by the deceased parent, and drove
away the weak heirs fraudulently. The people were so afflicted with
an insatiable greed for wealth that they were never satisfied however
much they might hoard and amass. This criticism is meant to make them
realize as to why the people with such an attitude and conduct in the
life of the world should not be called to account for their misdeeds.

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
discourse has been concluded with the assertion that accountability
shall certainly be held and it will be held on the Day when the
Divine Court will be established. At that time the deniers of the
judgment will understand that which they are not understanding now in
spite of instruction and admonition, but understanding then will be
of no avail. The denier will regret and say, &quot;Would that I had
provided for this Day beforehand while I lived in the world.&quot;
But his regrets will not save him from Allah's punishment. However,
as for the people who would have accepted the Truth, which the
heavenly books and the Prophets of God were presenting, with full
satisfaction of the heart in the world, Allah will be pleased with
them and they will be well pleased with the rewards bestowed by
Allah. They will be called upon to join the righteous and enter
Paradise. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote1sym" HREF="#sdfootnote1anc">1</A>Much
	difference of opinion has been expressed by the commentators in the
	commentary of these verses, so much so that in respect of &quot;the
	even and the odd&quot; there are as many as 36 different views. In
	some traditions the commentary of these verses has also been
	attributed to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace), but the fact is
	that no commentary is confirmed from him, otherwise it was not
	possible that anyone from among the Companions, their immediate
	successors, and later commentators would have dared to determine the
	meaning of these verses by himself after the commentary by the Holy
	Prophet. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After a
	study of the style one clearly feels that there was an argument
	already in progress in which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	was presenting some thing and the disbelievers were denying it. At
	this, affirming what the Holy Prophet presented, it was said: By
	such and such a thing&quot;, so as to say: &quot;By these things,
	what Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings) says is
	wholly based on the truth. Then, the argument is concluded with the
	question: &quot;Is there an oath in it for a man of understanding ?&quot;
	That is, &quot;is there need for yet another oath to testify to the
	truth of this matter ''&quot; Is this oath not enough to persuade a
	sensible man to accept that which Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
	peace and blessings) is presenting?&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now the
	question arises: what was the argument for the sake of which an oath
	was sworn by these four things? For this we shall have to consider
	the whole theme which, in the following verses, commences with:
	&quot;Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the 'Ad&quot; and
	continues till the end of the Surah. It shows that the argument
	concerned the rewards and punishments of the Hereafter, which the
	people of Makkah were refusing to acknowledge and the Holy Messenger
	(upon whom be peace) was trying to convince them of this by constant
	preaching and instruction. At this oaths were sworn by the dawn, the
	ten nights, the even and the odd, and the departing night to assert:
	Are these four things not enough to convince a sensible man of the
	truth of this matter so that he may need yet another evidence for
	it? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After
	having determined the significance of these oaths in the context, we
	would inevitably have to take each of these in the meaning relevant
	to the subsequent theme. First of all, it is said: &quot;By Fajr.&quot;
	Fajr is the breaking of day, i.e. the time when the first rays of
	the light of day appear in the midst of the darkness of night as a
	white streak from the east. Then, it is said: &quot;By the ten
	nights.&quot; If the context is kept in view, it will become plain
	that it implies each group of the ten nights among the thirty nights
	of the month, the first ten nights being those during which the
	crescent moon starting as a thin nail. goes on waxing every night
	until its major portion becomes bright; the second group of the ten
	nights being those during which the greater part of the night
	remains illumined by the moon, and the last ten nights being those
	during which the moon goes on waning and the nights becoming more
	and more dark until by the end of the month the whole night becomes
	absolutely dark. Then, it is said : &quot;By the even and the odd.&quot;
	Even is the number which is divisible into two equal parts, as 2, 4,
	6, 8, and the odd the number which is not so divisible, as l, 3, 5,
	7. Generally, it may imply everything in the universe, for things in
	the universe either exist in pairs or as singles. But since the
	context here concerns the day and the night, the even and the odd
	mean the alternation of day and night in the sense that the dates of
	the month go on changing from the first to the second, and from
	second to the third, and every change brings with it a new state.
	Last of all, it is said: &quot;By the night when it is departing&quot;,
	i.e. when the darkness which had covered the world since sunset may
	be at the verge of disappearing and the day be dawning.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider as a whole the four things an oath by which has been
	sworn to assert that the news which Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's
	peace and blessings) is giving of the meting out of rewards and
	punishments is wholly based on the truth. All these things point to
	the reality that an all-Powerful Sustainer is ruling over this
	universe, and nothing of what He is doing is absurd, purposeless, or
	lacking wisdom; on the contrary, a wise plan clearly underlies
	whatever He does. In His world one will never see that while it is
	night, the midday sun should suddenly appear overhead, or that the
	moon should appear one evening in the shape of the crescent and be
	followed next evening by the full moon, or that the night, when it
	falls, should never come to an end, but should become perpetual, or
	that there should be no system in the alternation of the day and
	night so that one could keep a record of the dates and know what
	month was passing, what was the date, on what date a particular work
	is to begin, and when it is to finish, what are the dates of the
	summer season and what of the rainy or winter season. Apart from
	countless other things of the universe if man only considers this
	regularity of the day and night intelligently and seriously, he will
	find evidence of the truth that this relentless discipline and order
	has been established by an Omnipotent Sovereign God; with it are
	connected countless of the advantages of the creatures whom He has
	created on the earth. Now, if a person living in the world of such a
	Wise, Omnipotent and All-Mighty Creator denies the rewards and
	punishments of the Hereafter, he inevitably commits one of the two
	errors: either he is a denier of His powers and thinks that though
	He has the power to create the universe with such matchless order
	and discipline, He is powerless to recreate man and mete out rewards
	and punishments to him or he denies His wisdom and knowledge and
	thinks that although He has created man with intellect and powers in
	the world, vet He will neither ever call him to account as to how he
	used his intellect and his powers, nor will reward him for his good
	deeds, nor punish him for his evil deeds. The one who believes in
	either, is foolish in the extreme.

	reasoning out the judgment from the system of day and night, now an
	argument is berg given from man's own history for its being a
	certainty The mention of the conduct of a few well known tribes of
	history and their ultimate end is meant to point out that the
	universe is not working under some deaf and blind law of nature, but
	a Wise God is ruling over it, and in the Kingdom of that God only
	one law, which man describes as the law of nature is not working,
	but a moral law also is operative, which necessarily calls for
	retribution and rewards and punishments. The results of the working
	of the law have been appearing over and over again even in this
	world, which point out to the people of understanding as to what is
	the nature of the Kingdom of the Universe. Any nation which carved
	out a system of life for itself heedless of the Hereafter and of the
	rewards and punishments of God, was ultimately corrupted and
	depraved, and whichever nation followed this way, was eventually
	visited with the scourge of punishment by the Lord of the universe.
	This continuous experience of man's own history testifies to two
	things clearly: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) That
	denial of the Hereafter has been instrumental in corrupting every
	nation and sending it ultimately to its doom; therefore, the
	Hereafter indeed is a reality clashing with which leads, as it has
	always led, to the same inevitable results; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) that
	retribution for deeds will at some time in the future take place in
	its full and complete form also, for the people who touched the
	extreme limits of corruption and depravity and were visited with
	punishment had been preceded be many others who had sown seeds of
	corruption for centuries and left the world without being visited by
	any scourge. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	justice of God demands that all those people also should be called
	to account at some time and they too should suffer for their
	misdeeds. (Argument from history and morals for the Hereafter has
	been given at many places in the Qur'an and we have explained it
	everywhere accordingly. For example, see E.N.'s 5, 6 of AI-A'raf,
	E.N. 12 of Yunus,, E.N.'s 57, 105, 115 of Hud, E.N. 9 of Ibrahim,

	Iram implies the ancient tribe of `Ad, who have been called 'Ad Ula
	in the Qur'an and Arabian history. In Surah An-Najm, it has been
	said: &quot;And that We destroyed the ancient people of `Ad&quot;
	(v. 50), i.e. the `Ad to whom the Prophet Hud had been sent, and who
	were punished with a scourge. As against thetas the people of `Ad
	who retrained safe and flourished afterwards are remembered as Ad
	Ukhra in Arabian history. The ancient `Ad are called Ad lram for the
	reason that they belonged to that branch of the Semetic race which
	descended from Iram son of Shem son of Noah (peace be upon him).
	Several other sub-branches of this main branch are well known in

	world. At another place in the Qur'an this characteristic has been
	mentioned in connection with the Prophet Hud, who said to them:
	&quot;What, you erect for mere pleasure a monument on every high
