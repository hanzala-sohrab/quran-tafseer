<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Although
there is no tradition to indicate its period of revelation, yet there
is in the subject matter of this Surah an internal evidence, which
shows that it is one of the earliest Surahs to be sent down at
Makkah. After verse 15 the discourse is suddenly interrupted and the
Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) told: &quot;Do not move your tongue
to remember this Revelation hastily. It is Our responsibility to have
it remembered and read. Therefore, when We are reciting it, listen to
its recital carefully. Again, it is Our responsibility to explain its
meaning.&quot; Then, from verse 20 onward the same theme which was
interrupted at verse 15, is resumed. This parenthetical passage,
according to both the context and the traditions, has been interposed
here for the reason that when the Angel Gabriel was reciting this
Surah to the Holy Prophet, the Holy Prophet, lest he should forget
its words later, was repeating them at the same moment. This in fact
happened at the time when the coming down and receipt of Revelation
was yet a new experience for him and he was not yet fully used to
receiving it calmly. There are two other instances also of this in
the Qur'an. First, in Surah Ta Ha the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
peace) has been told: &quot;And see that you do not hasten to recite
the Qur'an before its revelation is completed to you.&quot; (v. 114).
Then, in Surah Al-A'la, it has been said: &quot;We shall enable you
to recite:, then you shall never forget. (v. 6). Later, when the Holy
Prophet became fully used to receiving the Revelation well, there
remained no need to give him any such instruction. That is why except
for these, three, there is no other instance of this in the Qur'an. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Most
of the Surahs, from here till the end of the Qur'an, in view of their
content and style, seem to have been sent down in the period when
after the first seven verses of Surah Al-Muddaththir, revelation of
the Qur'an began like a shower of rain:Thus, in the successively
revealed Surahs Islam and its fundamental concepts and moral
teachings were presented so forcefully and effectively in pithy,
brief sentences and the people of Makkah warned so vehemently on
their errors and deviations that the Quraish chiefs were utterly
confounded. Therefore, before the next Hajj season came they held the
conference for devising schemes to defeat the Holy Prophet (upon whom
be peace) as has been mentioned in the Introduction to the Surah
Al-Muddaththir above. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this Surah, addressing thee deniers of the Hereafter, replies have
been given to each of their doubts and objections, strong arguments
have been given to prove the possibility, occurrence and necessity of
the Resurrection and Hereafter, and also it has been pointed out
clearly that the actual reason of the people's denying the Hereafter
is not that they regard it as impossible rationally but because their
selfish motives do not allow them to affirm it. At the same time, the
people have been warned, as if to say: &quot;The event, the
occurrence of which you deny, will inevitably come: all your deeds
will be brought and placed before you. As a matter of fact, even
before any of you sees his record, he will be knowing fully well what
he has done in the world, for no man is unaware of himself, no matter
what excuses and pretenses he may offer to deceive the world and
deceive himself in respect of his misdeeds.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>The
	Qur'an has mentioned three kinds of human self: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Ammarah: the self that urges man to evil;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Lawwamah: the self that feels repentant at doing wrong, thinking
	wrong and willing wrong and reproaches man for this; and the same is
	called Conscience in modern terminology; and 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
	Mumta'innah: the self that feels full satisfaction at following the
	right path and abandoning the wrong path. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here. the
	thing for which. Allah has sworn an oath by the Resurrection (al-
	Qiyamah) and the self-reproaching Self, has not been mentioned, for
	the following sentence itself points it out. The oath has been sworn
	to stress the truth that Allah will certainly resurrect man after
	death and He has full power to do so. Now, the question arises: What
	is the relevance of swearing an oath by these two truths to this
	thing? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the Day of Resurrection, the reason of swearing by it is certainty.
	The whole system of the universe testifies that it is neither
	eternal nor everlasting. Its own nature tells that it has neither
	existed since eternity nor can last till eternity. Human intellect
	has never had any strong argument to support the baseless view that
	this ever changing world could have existed since ever and would
	last for ever. But as the knowledge of man about this world goes on
	increasing, ii goes on becoming more and more certain for man
	himself that this workhouse of life had a beginning in time before
	which it was not, and necessarily it has also an end in time after
	which it will not be. For this reason, Allah has sworn an oath by
	Resurrection itself on the occurrence of Resurrection, and this is
	an oath of the kind that we might swear addressing a skeptical
	person, who may be skeptical about his own existence, saying: &quot;By
	you yourself, you exist, i.e., your own being itself testifies that
	you exist. &quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But an
	oath by the Day of Resurrection is only an argument for the truth
	that this system will one day be upset. As for the truth that after
	that man shall be resurrected and called upon to account for his
	deeds and made to see the good or evil results thereof, another oath
	has been sworn by the self reproaching soul. No man exists in the
	world, who may not have a faculty called Conscience in him. This
	Conscience is necessarily conscious of the good and evil, and no
	:natter how perverted and degraded a man might be, his Conscience
	always checks him on doing evil and for not doing good irrespective
	of the fact whether the criterion of good and evil that he had set
	for himself might in itself be right or wrong. This is an express
	pointer that man is not merely an animal but a moral being. He
	naturally can distinguish good from evil; he regards himself as
	responsible for the good or the evil he does; and even if he might
	feel pleased suppressing the reproaches of his Conscience over the
	evil he has done to another, he, on the contrary, feels and demands
	from within that the other one who has done the same evil to him,
	must deserve punishment. Now, if the existence of a self-reproaching
	soul of this kind in man himself is an undeniable truth, then this
	truth too is undeniable that the same self-reproaching soul is an
	evidence of the life hereafter, which exists in man's own nature
	itself. For this demand of nature that man must be rewarded or
	punished for his good or evil deeds for which he himself is
	responsible, cannot be met in any other way than in the life
	hereafter. No sensible man can deny that if man becomes non existent
	after death, he will certainly be deprived of the rewards of his
	good deeds and escape the just and lawful punishment of many of his
	evil deeds. Therefore, unless one comes to believe in the absurd
	idea that a rational being like man has stumbled into an irrational
	system of the universe and a moral being like man has happened to be
	born in a world which basically has nothing to do with morality, he
	cannot deny the life hereafter. Likewise, the philosophy of the
	transmigration of souls also is no reply to this demand of nature,
	for if man goes on being born and reborn in this very world for the
	sake of being rewarded and punished for his moral acts, in every
	cycle of life he will perform some additional moral acts, which
	again will nerd to be rewarded and punished, thus making his account
	snore and snore lengthy and complicated in an endless way instead of
	being settled tidally and for good. Therefore, this demand of nature
	is fulfilled only in case man in this world should have only one
	life and then, after the whole human race has been brought to an
	end, there should be another life in which all acts of man should be
	judged and assessed rightly and justly and he should be fully
	rewarded or punished in consequence thereof. (For further
	explanation, see E.N. 30 of Surah Al-A'raf).&nbsp;

	above two arguments, which have been presented in the form of the
	oaths, only prove two things. First, that the end of the world (i.e.
	the first stage of Resurrection) is a certainty; and second, that
	another life after death is necessary, for without it the logical
	and natural demands of man's being a moral being cannot be
	fulfilled; and this will certainly happen, for the existence of the
	Conscience in man testifies to it. Now, this third argument has been
	given to prove that life after death is possible. The people of
	Makkah who denied it, said again and again: &quot;How can it be that
	the people who died hundreds of thousands of years ago, whose bodies
	have disintegrated into particles and mixed in the dust, whose bones
	decayed and were scattered away by the winds, some of whom were
	burnt to ashes, others devoured by the beasts of prey, still others
	drowned in the seas and swallowed by fish, the material constituents
	of their bodies should re-assemble and every man should rise up as
	the same person that he once was ten or twenty thousand years
	before? Allah has given its very rational and highly forceful reply
	in the form of this brief question: &quot;Does man think that We
	shall not be able to put his bones together?&quot; That is, &quot;If
	you had been told that the scattered particles of your body would
	reunite of their own accord some time in the future, and you would
	come back to life by yourself with this very body, you would no
	doubt have been justified in regarding it as impossible. But what
	you have actually been told is that such a thing will not happen by
	itself, but Allah Almighty will do this. Now, do you really think
	that the Creator of the universe, Whom you yourself also regard as
	the Creator, would be powerless to do so?&quot; This was such a
	question in answer to which nobody who believed in God to be the
	Creator of the universe; could say, neither then nor today, that
	even God Himself could not do this even if He so willed. And if a
	disbeliever says such a thing, he can be asked: How did God in the
	first instance make the body in which you at present exist, by
	gathering its countless particles together from the air, water and
	earth and many other places you know not what, and how can you say
	that the same God cannot gather its constituent parts together once

	whole passage from here to &quot;Again, it is for Us to explain its
	meaning&quot;, is a parenthesis, which has been interposed here as
	an address to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace). As we have
	explained in the Introduction above, in the initial stage of the
	Prophethood when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was not yet
	fully used to receiving the Revelation, he was afraid when
	Revelation came down to him whether he would be able to remember
	exactly what the Angel Gabriel (peace be on him) was reciting to him
	or not. Therefore, he would try to commit to memory rapidly what he
	heard from the Angel simultaneously. The same thing happened when
	Gabriel was reciting these verses of Surah Al-Qiyamah. Therefore,
	interrupting what was being revealed, the holy Prophet was
	instructed to the effect: &quot;Do not try to memorize the words of
	the revelation, but listen to it attentively and carefully. It is
	Our responsibility to enable you to remember it by heart and then to
	recite it accurately. Rest assured that you will not forget even a
	word of this Revelation, nor ever commit a mistake in reciting it!

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After

	background regard these sentences as wholly unconnected with the
	context when they see them interposed here. But one does not see any
	irrelevance when one has understood their background. This can be
	understood by an example. A teacher seeing the inattentiveness of a
	student in the course of the lesson might interrupt the lesson to
	tell him, &quot;Listen to me carefully&quot;, and then resume his
	speech, This sentence will certainly seem to be irrelevant to those
	who might be unaware of the incident and might read the lesson when
	it is printed and published word for word, But the one who is aware
	of the incident because of which this sentence was interposed, will
	feel satisfied that the lesson has been reproduced verbatim and
	nothing has been increased or decreased in it in the process of
	reproduction.

	explanation that we have given above of the interpolation of the
	parenthesis in the present context, is not merely based .on
	conjecture, but it has been explained likewise in the authentic
	traditions. Imam Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi Ibn Jarir,
	Tabarani, Baihaqi and other traditionists have related with
	authentic chains of transmitters a tradition from Hadrat `Abdullah
	bin `Abbas, saying that when the Qur'an was revealed to the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace), he would start repeating the words of
	the Revelation rapidly as the Angel Gabriel recited them, fearing
	lest he should forget some part of it later. Thereupon, he was
	instructed: &quot;Do not move your tongue to remember this
	Revelation hastily ... The same thing has been related from Sha`bi,

	gives the feeling, and some early commentators also have given
	expression to the same, that probably in the beginning the Holy
	Messenger of Allah used to ask of the Angel Gabriel the meaning of a
	verse or a word or a command of the Qur'an even in the very midst of
	the Revelation itself. Therefore, the Holy Prophet was not only
	given the instruction that he should listen quietly to Revelation
	when it came down to him, and assured that its each word would be
	preserved in his memory precisely, and he would be enabled to recite
	the Qur'an exactly as it was revealed, but at the same time it was
	also promised that he would be made to understand the meaning and
	intention of each command and each instruction of Divine Revelation.
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is a
	very important verse, which proves certain fundamental concepts
	which if understood well, can protect one against the errors which
	some people have been spreading before as they are spreading them
	today. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, it
	clearly proves that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) did not
	receive only the Revelation which is recorded in the Qur'an but
	besides that he was also given such knowledge by revelation as is
	not recorded in it. For, if the meaning and intention of the
	commandments of the Qur'an, its allusions, its words and its
	specific terms, which the Holy Prophet was made to understand, had
	been recorded in the Qur'an, there was no need to say that it was
	also Allah's own responsibility to explain its meaning, for it
	should then be there in the Qur'an itself. Hence, one will have to
	admit that the explanations which were given by Allah of the
	meanings of the contents of the Qur'an, were in any case in addition
	to the words of the Qur'an. This is another proof of the secret
	Revelation to the Holy Prophet which the Qur'an provides. (For
	further proofs of this from the Qur'an, see our book Sunnat ki A ni
	Haithiyat pp. 94-95 and pp. 118-125). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	the explanation of the meaning and intention of the Qur'an and of
	its commandments that was given by Allah to the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be peace), was given for the purpose that he should make the
	people understand the Qur'an by his word and deed according to it
	and teach them to act on its Commands. If this was not the object,
	and the explanation was only given so that he may restrict its
	knowledge to himself, it was then an exercise in futility, for it
	could not help in any way in the performance of the prophetic
	duties. Therefore, only a foolish person could say that this
	explanatory work had no legal value at all. Allah Himself has said
	in Surah An-Nahl: 44: &quot;And O Prophet, We have sent down this
	Admonition to you so that you may make plain and explain to the
	people the teaching which has been sent for them.&quot; (For
	explanation, see E.N. 40 of Surah An-Nahl). And at four places in
	the Qur'an Allah has stated that the Holy Prophet's task was not
	only to recite the verses of the Book of Allah but also to teach the
	Book. (Al-Baqarah: 129,.151, Al-Imran: 164, Al-Jumu`ah: 2. We have
	fully explained all these verses at pp. 74-77 of Sunnat ki A'ini
	Haithiyat After this, how can a believer of the Qur'an deny that the
	Qur'an's correct and authoritative, as a matter of fact official,
	explanation is only that which the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	has given by his word and deed, for it is not his personal
	explanation but the explanation given by the God Who sent down the
	Qur'an to him. Apart from this, or leaving this aside any person who
	explains a verse, or a word, of the Qur'an according to his personal
	whim and desire, commits a boldness which no true believer could
	ever commit. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly,
	even if a person has read the Qur'an only cursorily, he cannot help
	feeling that there are many things in it whose actual meaning and
	intention cannot be understood by a reader of Arabic only from the
	words of the Qur'an, nor can he know how to act on the commands
	enjoined in them. Take the word salat for instance; The act which
	has been most stressed by the Qur'an after the affirmation of faith
	is the act of salat. But no man only with the help of the dictionary
	can determine its actual meaning. At the most what one can
	understand from the way it has been repeatedly mentioned in the
	Qur'an is that this Arabic word has been used in some special
	terminological sense, and it probably implies some special act which
	the believers are required to perform. But merely by reading the
	Qur'an no reader of Arabic can determine what particular act it is,
	and how it is to be performed. The question: If the Sender of the
	Qur'an had not appointed a teacher from Himself and explained to him
	the precise and exact meaning of this term and taught him the method
	in full detail of implementing the command of salat, could there be
	even two Muslims in the world who would have agreed on one method of
	acting on the command of salat just by reading the Qur'an? The
	reason why Muslims have been performing salat in one and the same
	way, generation after generation, for more than 1500 years, and the
	way millions and millions of Muslims are carrying out the command of
	salat similarly in every part of the world, is that Allah had not
	only revealed the words of the Qur'an to His Messenger but had also
	explained to him fully the meaning of those words and the same
	meaning he taught to the people who accepted the Qur'an as the Book
	of Allah and him as the Messenger of Allah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Fourthly,
	the means of knowing the explanation of the words of the Qur'an that
	Allah taught His Messenger and the Messenger his Ummah by word and
	deed, is none but the Hadith and the Sunnah, The Hadith implies the
	traditions which the earliest followers passed on to the later
	generations about the sayings and acts of the Messenger on sound
	authority, and the Sunnah implies the way of life which became
	prevalent in the individual and collective life of the Muslims by
	the Holy Messenger's oral and practical teaching, the details of
	which have been bequeathed by the former to the latter generations
	by reliable traditions as well as seen .by them practically in the
	life of the earliest followers. The person who refuses to
	acknowledge this means of knowledge, in fact, says that Allah after
	taking the responsibility of explaining the meaning of the Qur'an to
	His Messenger had, God forbid, failed to fulfill His promise. For
	this responsibility had not been taken to explain the meaning only
	to the Messenger in his personal capacity but for the purpose that
	the Ummah also be made to understand the meaning of the Divine Book
	through the agency of the Messenger. And as soon as the Hadith and
	the Sunnah are denied to be a source of law, it virtually amounts to
	saying that Allah has failed to carry out His responsibility. May
	Allah protect us froth such blasphemy! To the one who argues that
	many people had also fabricated Hadid, we would say that fabrication
	of Hadid itself is a major proof of the fact that in the beginning
	the entire Ummah gave the sayings and acts of the Holy Messenger
	(Upon whom be Allah's peace) the status of law, otherwise why should
	the people who wanted to spread error have fabricated false ,Hadith.
	For only those coins are counterfeited which are current in the
	bazaar; nobody would print paper currency which had no value in the
	bazaar. Then, those who say such a thing perhaps do not know that
	this Ummah had seen to it from the very beginning that no falsehood
	was ascribed to the holy man whose sayings and acts had the status
	of law, and as the danger of ascribing false things to him
	increased, the well-wishers of the Ummah made greater and still
	greater efforts to distinguish the genuine from the counterfeit. The
	science of distinguishing the genuine from the false traditions is a
	unique science invented and developed only by the Muslims.
	Unfortunate indeed are those who without acquiring this science are
	being misled by the western orientalists to look upon the Hadith and

	is the second reason for denying the Hereafter, the first being the
	one mentioned in verse 5 above, saying: Since man wants to avoid the
	moral restrictions which are inevitably imposed by the belief in the
	Hereafter, his selfish motives, in fact, urge him to deny the
	Hereafter, and then he tries to present arguments in order to
	rationalize his denial. Now, the second reason being presented is
	that the deniers of the Hereafter are narrow-minded and
	shortsighted; for them only those results are all important, which
	appear in this world, and they do not give any importance to those
	effects which will appear in the Hereafter. They think that they
	should expend all their labor and effort in attaining whatever
	benefits, pleasures or joys they can attain here, for if one
	attained this, one attained everything, no matter what evil end this
	might lead to in the Hereafter. Likewise, they think that the loss
	or trouble or grief that can afflict one here is a thing that one
	must avoid, no matter how great a reward it might earn one in the
	Hereafter if one endured it here. They are only interested in the
	cash bargain. For the sake of as remote a thing as the Hereafter
	they can neither abandon a profit nor suffer a loss today. With this
	mode of thought when they discuss the question of the Hereafter
	rationally, it is not true rationalism but a mode of thinking
	because of which they are resolved not to acknowledge the Hereafter
	in any case even if their conscience might be crying froth within
	that the arguments for the possible occurrence and necessity of the
	Hereafter given in the Qur'an are highly rational and their own

	commentators have understood this allegorically. They say that the
	words &quot;looking towards someone&quot; are used idiomatically for
	having expectations from some one, awaiting his decision and hoping
	for his mercy and kindness: so much so that even a blind person also
	says that he is looking towards some one in the hope to see how he
	helps him. But in a large number of the Ahadith the commentary that
	has been reported of it from the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	is that on the Hereafter the illustrious servants of Allah will be
	blessed with the vision of their Lord. According to a tradition in
	Bukhari: &quot;You will openly see your Lord.&quot; Muslim and
	Tirmidhi have related on the authority of Hadrat Suhaib that the
	Holy Prophet said: &quot;When the righteous people enter Paradise.
	Allah will ask them: Do you want that I should bless you with
	something more? They will answer: Have You not made our faces
	bright: Have You not admitted us into Paradise and saved us from
	Hell? Thereupon, Allah will remove the curtain and none of the
	blessings that they had been blessed with until then will be dearer
	to them than that they should be blessed with the vision of their
	Lord&quot; And this very reward is the additional reward about which
	the Qur'an says: &quot;Those who have done excellent works, will get
	excellent rewards, and even something in addition to that.&quot;
	(Yunus: 26) Bukhari and Muslim have related, on the authority of
	Hadrat Abu Sa'id Khudri and Hadrat Abu Hurairah: &quot;The people
	asked: O Messenger of Allah, shall we see our Lord on the Day of
	Resurrection? The Holy Messenger replied: Do you find any difficulty
	in seeing the sun and the moon when there is no cloud in between?
	They said that they did not. The Holy Messenger said: Likewise, you
	will see you Lord.&quot; Another tradition bearing almost on the
	same subject has been reported in Bukhari and Muslim from Hadrat
	Jarir bin `Abdullah. Imam Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Daraqutni, lbn Jarir, Ibn
	AIMundhir. Tabarani, BaihaqI. Ibn Abi Shaibah and some other
	traditionists have related, with a little variation in wordings a
	tradition from Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Umar, saying: &quot;The man of
	the lowest rank among the dwellers of Paradise will see the vastness
	of his kingdom up to a distance covered in two thousand years, and
	the people of the highest rank among them will see their Lord twice
	daily. Then, the Holy Prophet recited this verse: `On that Day some
	faces shall be fresh, looking towards their Lord'.&quot; A tradition
	in Ibn Majah from Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah is to the effect:
	&quot;Allah will look towards them, and they will look towards
	Allah. Then, until Allah hides Himself from them, they will not pay
	attention to any other blessing of Paradise, and will continue to
	look towards Him.&quot; On the basis of this and many other
	traditions, the followers of the Sunnah almost unanimously
	understand this verse in the meaning that in the Hereafter the
	Dwellers of Paradise will be blessed with the vision of Allah, and
	this is supported by this verse of the Qur'an too: &quot;Nay, surely
	on that Day they (the sinners) shall be kept away from their Lord's
	vision.&quot; (AI-Mutaffifin: 15). From this one can automatically
	conclude that this deprivation will be the lot of the sinners. not
	of the righteous. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Here,
	the question arises how can man ever see God? A thing is seen when
	it is there in a particular direction, place, form and color, and
	the rays of light are reflected from it to the eye of man and its
	image is conveyed from the eye to the sight area in the brain. Is it
	ever conceivable with regard to the Being of Allah, Lord of the
	Universe, that man would be able to see Him in this way? But this
	question, in fact, springs from a grave misunderstanding. It does
	not take into account the distinction between two things: the
	essence of seeing and the specific form of the occurrence of the act
	of seeing with which we are familiar in the world. The essence of
	seeing is that the seer should be characterized by the power of
	sight: he should not be blind, and the thing to be seen should be
	manifest to him, not hidden from him. But in the world what we
	experience and observe is only the specific form of seeing in which
	a man or an animal practically sees something, and for this it is
	necessary that the seer should have an organ called the eye in his
	body, the eye should have the power of sight, it should have a
	physically bounded, colored object before it, which should reflect
	rays of light to the eye, and the eye should be able to receive its
	image. Now, if a person thinks that the practical demonstration of
	the essence of seeing can take place only in the form with which we
	are familiar in the world, he would be only showing the narrowness
	of his own mental outlook; otherwise there can be in the Kingdom of
	God countless ways of seeing, which we cannot even imagine. The one
	who disputes this should tell us whether his God is seeing or blind.
	If He is seeing and sees His whole Universe and everything in it,
	does He see all this with an organ called the eye with which men and
	animals see things in the world, and does the act of seeing issue
	forth from Him as it issues forth from us? Obviously, the answer to
	this is in the negative, and when it is so, why should a sensible
	man find it difficult to understand that in the Hereafter the
	dwellers of Paradise will not see Allah in the specific form in
	which man sees something in the world, but there nature of seeing
	will be different, which we cannot comprehend here. The fact is that
	it is even more difficult for us to understand the nature of the
	Hereafter precisely and accurately than it is for a two-year-old
	child to understand what matrimonial life is, whereas he himself
	will experience it when he grows up.&nbsp; </FONT></FONT>

	word suda when used with regard to a camel implies a camel who is
	wandering aimlessly, grazing at will, without there being anybody to
	look after him. Thus, the verse means: &quot;Does man think that he
	has been left to himself to wander at will as if his Creator had
	laid no responsibility on him, had imposed no duty on him, had
	forbidden nothing to him, that at no time in future he would be
	required to account for his deeds'?&quot; This same theme has been
	expressed in Al Mu'minun: 115 thus: &quot;On the Day of
	Resurrection, Allah will ask the disbelievers: 'Did you think that
	We had created you without any purpose, and that you would never be
	brought back to Us?&quot; At both these places the argument for the
	necessity of the life hereafter has been presented as a question.
	The question means: Do you really think that you are no more than
	mere animals? Don't you see the manifest difference between yourself
	and the animal? The animal has been created without the power of
	choice and authority, but you have been blessed with the power of
	choice and authority; there is no question of morality about what
	the animal does, but your acts are necessarily characterized by good
	and evil. Then, how did you take it into your head that you had been
	created irresponsible and unanswerable as the animal has been? Why
	the animal will not be resurrected, is quite understandable The
	animal only fulfilled the fixed demands of its instinct it did not
	use its intellect to propound a philosophy; it did not invent a
	religion; it did not snake anyone its god nor became a god for
	others; it did nothing that could be called good or bad; it did not
	enforce a good or bad way of life, which would influence others,
	generation after generation, so that it should deserve a reward or
	punishment for it. Hence, if it perished to annihilation, it would
	be understandable, for it could not be held responsible for any of
	its acts to account for which it might treed to be resurrected. But
	how could you be excused from life after-death when right till the
	time of your death you continued to perform moral acts, which your
	own intellect judged as good or bad and worthy of reward or
	punishment? Should a man who killed an innocent person and then fell
	a victim to a sudden accident immediately after it, get off
	Scot-free and should never be punished for the crime of murder he
	committed? Do you really feel satisfied that a man, who sowed
	corruption and iniquity in the world, which entailed evil
	consequences for mankind for centuries after him, should himself
	perish like an insect; or a grasshopper, and should never be
	resurrected to account for his misdeeds, which corrupted the lives
	of hundreds of thousands of human beings after him? Do you think
	that the man, who struggled throughout his life for the cause of
	truth and justice, goodness and peace, and suffered hardships for
	their sake, was a creation of the kind of an insect, and had no
	right to be rewarded for his good acts?&nbsp;
