<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
will be explained below, according to some traditions this Surah was
sent down in the period when the Holy Prophet had started calling the
people openly to Islam in Makkah, and this had caused great alarm
among the chiefs of the Quraish. If this be true, its period of
revelation would be about the 4th year of the Prophethood. According
to some other traditions, it was sent down after Hadrat Umar's
embracing Islam, and this happened, as is well known, after the
migration to Habash. Another chain of the traditions shows that the
event which occasioned the revelation of this Surah took place during
the last illness of Abu Talib. If this be correct, the period of its
revelation would be the 10th or 11th year of the Prophethood. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Here
is a resume of the traditions related by Imam Ahmad, Nasa'i,
Tirmidhi, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Shaibah, Ibn Abu Hatim, Muhammad bin
Ishaq and others: </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">When
Abu Talib fell ill, and the Quraish chiefs knew that his end was
near, they held consultations and decided to approach the old chief
with the request that he should solve the dispute between them and
his nephew. For they feared that if Abu Talib died and then they
subjected Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace) to a harsh treatment,
after his death, the Arabs would taunt them, saying, &quot;They were
afraid of the old chief as long as he lived now that he is dead they
have started maltreating his nephew.&quot; At least 25 of the Quraish
chiefs including Abu Jahl, Abu Sufyan, Umayyah bin Khalaf, As bin
Wa'il, Aswad bin al-Muttalib, 'Uqbah bin Abi Mu'ait, Utbah and
Shaibah went to Abu Talib. First, they put before him their
complaints against the Holy Prophet as usual, then said, &quot;We
have come to present before you a just request and it is this : let
your nephew leave us to our religion, and we shall leave him to his.
He may worship whomever he may please: we shall not stand in his way
in this matter; but he should not condemn our gods, and should not
try to force us to give them up. Please tell him to make terms with
us on this condition&quot;. Abu Talib called the Holy Prophet and
said, &quot;Dear nephew, these people of your tribe have come to me
with a request. They want you to agree with them on a just matter so
as to put an end to your dispute with them.&quot; Then he told him
about the request of the chiefs of the Quraish. The Holy Prophet
replied, &quot;Dear uncle: I shall request them to agree upon a thing
which, if they accept, will enable them to conquer the whole of
Arabia and subject the non-Arab world to their domination. &quot;Hearing
this the people were first confounded; they did not know how they
should turn down such a proposal. Then, after they had considered the
matter, they replied: &quot;You speak of one word: we are prepared to
repeat ten others like it, but please tell us what it is.&quot; The
Holy Prophet said: </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">La
ilaha ill-Allah</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">.
At this they got up all together and left the place saying what Allah
has narrated in the initial part of this Surah. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">has related this event just as cited
above, but, according to him, this did not happen during Abu Talibs
last illness but at the time when the Holy Prophet had started
preaching Islam openly, and the news of the conversion of one person
or the other was being heard almost daily in Makkah. In those days
the Quraish chiefs had led several deputations to Abu Talib and had
asked him to stop Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)
from preaching his message, and it was with one of those deputations
that this conversation had taken place. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Zamakhshari,
Razi, Nisaburi ond some other commentators say that this deputation
went to Abu Talib at the time then the chiefs of the Quraish had been
upset at Hadrat Umar's embracing Islam; but no reference to its basis
is available in any book of the traditions, nor have these
commentators cited the source of their this information. However, if
it be true, it is understand able. For the unbelieving Quraish had
already been bewildered to see that the person who had arisen from
among themselves with the message of Islam had no parallel in the
entire tribe as regarded nobility, purity of character, wisdom and
seriousness. Moreover, his right hand man and chief supporter was a
man like Abu Bakr, who was well known in and around Makkah as a
gentle, righteous and brilliant man. Now when they might have seen
that a brave and resolute man like Umar also had joined them, they
must have felt that the danger was growing and becoming intolerable. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Surah begins with a review of the aforesaid meeting. Making the
dialogue between the Holy Prophet and the disbelievers the basis,
Allah says that the actual reason with those people for their denial
is not any defect in the message of Islam but their own arrogance,
jealousy and insistence on following the blind. They are not prepared
to believe in a man from their own clan as a Prophet of God and
follow him. They want to persist in the ideas of ignorance which they
have found their ancestors following. And when a person exposes their
this ignorance and presents the truth before them, they are alarmed
and regard it as an oddity, rather as a novel and impossible thing.
For them the concept of Tauhid and the Hereafter is not only an
unacceptable creed but also a concept which only deserves to be
ridiculed and mocked. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then,
Allah, both in the initial part of the Surah and in its last
sentences, has precisely warned the disbelievers, as if to say, &quot;The
man whom you are ridiculing today and whose guidance you reject will
soon overpower you,and the time is not far when in this very city of
Makkah, where you are persecuting him, he will overwhelm you
completely.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Then
describing nine of the Prophets, one after the other, with greater
details of the story of the Prophets David and Solomon; Allah has
emphasized the point that His Law of Justice is impartial and
objective, that only the right attitude of man is acceptable to Him,
that He calls to account and punishes every wrongdoer who. ever he
be, and that He likes only those people who do not persist in
wrongdoing but repent as soon as they are warned of it, and pass
their life in the world keeping in mind their accountability in the
Hereafter. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
this, the final end that the obedient servants and the disobedient
people will meet in the Hereafter, has been depicted, and two things
have been especially impressed on the disbelievers:(1) That the
leaders and guides whom the ignorant people are following blindly in
the world, on the way of deviation, will have reached Hell even
before their followers in the Hereafter, and the two groups will be
cursing each other there; and (2) that the disbelievers will be
amazed to see that there is no trace whatever in Hell of the
believers whom they used to regard as contemptible in the world and
will themselves be involved in its torment. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

and are not prepared to obey him whom God has appointed His
messenger. Therefore, you will be doomed ultimately to the same fate
as will be met by Satan.&quot; </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

O Prophet,have patience at what they utter,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote16anc" HREF="#sdfootnote16sym"><SUP>16</SUP></A>
and tell them the story of Our servant David,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote17anc" HREF="#sdfootnote17sym"><SUP>17</SUP></A>
who was a man of great strength.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote18anc" HREF="#sdfootnote18sym"><SUP>18</SUP></A>
He turned to Allah in every matter. We had subdued for him the
mountains, which joined with him in praise morning and evening. The
birds would gather together: they all turned to his (hymns of)
praise.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote19anc" HREF="#sdfootnote19sym"><SUP>19</SUP></A>
We had strengthened his kingdom, had given him wisdom and the ability
to pronounce sound judgments.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote20anc" HREF="#sdfootnote20sym"><SUP>20</SUP></A>
Has the story of the litigants, who had entered into his upper
chamber by climbing over the wall, reached you?<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote21anc" HREF="#sdfootnote21sym"><SUP>21</SUP></A>
When they came before David, he was alarmed to see them.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote22anc" HREF="#sdfootnote22sym"><SUP>22</SUP></A>
They said, &quot;Have no fear: we are two parties in a suit, one of
which has wronged the other, so decide between us rightly: do not be
unjust and guide us to the right way. This is my brother.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote23anc" HREF="#sdfootnote23sym"><SUP>23</SUP></A>
He has ninety-nine ewes and I have only one ewe. He said to me, `Give
this ewe also in my charge, and he has prevailed over me in the
dispute'.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote24anc" HREF="#sdfootnote24sym"><SUP>24</SUP></A>
David replied, &quot;This person has certainly wronged you in
demanding your ewe to be added to his ewes.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote25anc" HREF="#sdfootnote25sym"><SUP>25</SUP></A>
And the fact is that the people who live together often wrong one
another; the only exception are those who believe and do good works,
and they are few. &quot; (While he said this) David realized that We
had, in fact, tried him. So he asked forgiveness of his Lord and fell
down prostrate and turned (to Him).<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote26anc" HREF="#sdfootnote26sym"><SUP>26</SUP></A>
Then We forgave him for his error, and certainly he has a place of
nearness with Us and an excellent abode!<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote27anc" HREF="#sdfootnote27sym"><SUP>27</SUP></A>
(We said:) &quot;O David, We have made you vicegerent in the earth,
so rule among the people with justice and do not follow your lust,
for it will lead you astray from Allah's Way.&quot; For those who go
astray from Allah's Way, there is a severe punishment because they
forgot the Day of Reckoning.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote28anc" HREF="#sdfootnote28sym"><SUP>28</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

And to David We gave (a son like) Solomon,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote32anc" HREF="#sdfootnote32sym"><SUP>32</SUP></A>
an excellent servant, who turned to his Lord over and over again.
Worthy of mention is the occasion when, one evening, well-bred horses
were presented before him,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote33anc" HREF="#sdfootnote33sym"><SUP>33</SUP></A>
and he said, &quot;I have adopted the love of this wealth<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote34anc" HREF="#sdfootnote34sym"><SUP>34</SUP></A>
because of the remembrance of my Lord.&quot; So, when the horses
disappeared from sight, (he commanded:) &quot;Bring them back to me.
&quot; Then he began to stroke their shanks and necks.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote35anc" HREF="#sdfootnote35sym"><SUP>35</SUP></A>
And (note that) We put Solomon too to the test and placed a mere body
on his throne. Then he turned (to Allah), and said, &quot;My Lord,
forgive me and grant me a kingdom as may belong to no one else after
me. Indeed, Thou art the real Giver.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote36anc" HREF="#sdfootnote36sym"><SUP>36</SUP></A>
So, We subdued to him the wind, which blew gently at his bidding
wherever he directed it.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote37anc" HREF="#sdfootnote37sym"><SUP>37</SUP></A>
And We subjected to him the satans: all kinds of builders and divers
and others who were bound in chains.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote38anc" HREF="#sdfootnote38sym"><SUP>38</SUP></A>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote26">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote26sym" HREF="#sdfootnote26anc">26</A>There
	is a difference of opinion as to whether it is obligatory to perform
	a sajdah (prostration) on this occasion or not. Imam Shafe'i says
	that it is not obligatory, for this is only a Prophet' tepentance;
	but Imam Abu Hanifah has opined that prostration here is obligatory.
	The traditionalists have related three traditions from lbn- 'Abbas
	in this regard. According to 'Ikrimah, Ibn 'Abbas said: &quot;this
	is not one of those verses on the recitation of which prostration is
	obligatory, but I have seen the Holy Prophet prostrating himself on
	this occasion. &quot;(Bukhari, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi, NASa'I, Musnad
	Ahmad). The second tradition which Said bin Jubair has related froth
	Ibn 'Abbas is to the effect: 'The Holy Prophet prostrated himself in
	Surah Suad and said: 'The Prophet David (on whom be peace) had
	prostrated himself in order to express his repentance and we
	prostrate ourselves as a token of gratitude, because his repentance
	was accepted. (Nasa'i) In the third tradition that Mujahid has
	related from him, he says: &quot;Allah has commanded the Holy
	Prophet, in the Qur'an: &quot;These were the ones whom Allah had
	shown the Right Way: therefore, you should follow their way'.&quot;
	(AI-An'am: 90). Now, since David was a Prophet and he had prostrated
	himself on this occasion, the Holy Prophet also prostrated himself
	here only to follow his way. (Bukhari). These three arc the
	statements of Hadrat Ibn 'Abbas: and Hadrat Abu Sa' id Khudri says:
	&quot;The Holy Prophet once recited Surah Suad in his address, and
	when he came to this verse, he descended from the pulpit and
	performed a prostration and the audience also did the same along
	with him. Then, on another occasion, he recited this same Surah and
	when the people heard this verse, they were ready to perform the
	prostration. The Holy Prophet said 'This is the repentance of a
	Prophet, but I see that you have got ready to perform the
	prostration' --Saying this he descended from the pulpit and
	prostrated himself and the people also did the same.&quot; (Abu
	Da'ud). Although these traditions do not provide any absolute
	argument to prove that it is obligatory to perform the prostration
	here, yet they prove at least that because the Holy Prophet
	generally performed a prostration on this occasion, it is in any
	case commendable to prostrate here. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	thing that one notices in this verse is that Allah has used the
	words kharra raki'an (fell in ruku') here, but All the commentators
	arc agreed that this implies kharra sajid-an (fell in sajdah:
	prostration). On this very basis, Imam Abu Hanifah and his
	companions have expressed the opinion that one may perform only a
	ruku' instead of a sajdah, when one recites or hears being recited a
	verse requiring a sajdah in the Prayer or outside it. For when Allah
	has used the word ruku' to imply sajdah, it becomes obvious that
	ruku' can represent sajdah. Imam Khattabi, a Shafe'ite jurist, also
	holds the same opinion, Though this opinion in itself is sound and
	reasonable, we do not find any precedent in the practices of the
	Holy Prophet and his Companions that they might have been content
	with performing a ruku' only instead of a sajdah on a verse
	requiring a sajdah. Therefore, one should act upon the view only
	when there is an obstruction in performing the sajdah; it would be
	wrong to make it a practice, Imam Abu Hanifah and his companions

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) Why

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	people who have studied the Bible (the Holy Book of the Jews and
	Christians) are not unaware that in this Book the Prophet David has
	been accused clearly of committing adultery with the wife of Uriah
	the Hittite and then marrying her after having Uriah intentionally
	slain in a battle. It has also been alleged that this same woman,
	who had surrendered herself to the Prophet David, while being
	another man's wife, was the mother of the Prophet Solomon. This
	story is found with all its details in chapters 11 and 12 of the
	Second Book of Samuel in the Old Testament. It had been included in
	it centuries before the revelation of the Qur'an. Any Jew or
	Christian who read his Holy Book anywhere in the world, or heard it
	read, was not only aware of this story but also believed in it as
	true. It spread through them, and even in the present time no book
	is written in the West on the history of the Israelites and the
	Hebrew religion, in which this charge against the Prophet David is
	not repeated. This well known story also contains the following: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">And the
	Lord sent Nathan onto David. And he came unto him, and said unto
	him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other
	poor. The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds: But the poor
	man had nothing, save one little ewe Iamb, which he had bought and
	nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his
	children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and
	lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter. And there Came a
	traveler Unto the rich man, and he spared to take of his own flock
	and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring man that was come
	unto him; but took the poor man' Iamb, and dressed it for the man
	that was come to him. And David's anger was greatly kindled against
	the man; and he said to Nathan, As the Lord liveth, the man that
	hath done this thing shall surely die: And he shall restore the lamb
	fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity. And
	Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the Lord God of
	Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out
	of the hand of Saul; And I gavc thee thy master's house, and thy
	master's wives into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and
	of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have
	given unto thee such and such things. Wherefore hast thou despised
	the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his sight? Thou hast
	killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to
	be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of
	Ammon.&quot; (2 Samuel, ch 12: 1-9). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When this
	story was so well known among the people there was no need that a
	detailed account of it should have been given in the Qur'an, nor is
	it the way of Allah to mention such things openly in His Holy Book.
	That is why only tacit allusions have been made to it here as well
	as pointed out what the actual event was and what the people of the
	Book have turned it into. The actual event as one clearly
	understands from the aforesaid statement of the Qur'an was: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Prophet David peace be upon him) had only expressed this desire
	before Uriah (or whatever be the name of the man) that he should
	divorce his wife; as this desire had been expressed not by a common
	man but by an illustrious king and a great Prophet before a member
	of the public, the man was finding himself constrained to yield to
	it even in the absence of any compulsion. On this occasion, before
	the man could act as the Prophet David had desired, two righteous
	men of the nation suddenly made their appearance before David and
	presented before him this matter in the form of an imaginary case.
	At first, the Prophet David thought it was a real case, and so gave
	his decision after hearing it. But as soon as he uttered the words
	of the decision, his conscience gave the warning that the parable
	precisely applied to the case between him and the person, and that
	the act which he was describing as an injustice had issued forth
	from his own person. As soon as he realized this, he fell down
	prostrate, repented and reversed his decision. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	question, as to how this event took the ugly shape as related in the
	Bible, also becomes obvious after a little consideration. It appears
	that the Prophet David had come to know of the unique qualities of
	the woman through some means and had started thinking that she
	should be the queen of the country instead of being the wife of an
	ordinary officer, Overwhelmed by the thought he expressed the desire
	before her husband that he should divorce her. He did not see any
	harm in it because it was not looked upon as anything improper among
	the Israelites. It was an ordinary thing among them that if a person
	happened to like the wife of another, he would freely request him to
	give her up for him. Nobody minded such a request, and often it so
	happened that friends would divorce their wives for each other's
	sake of their own accord, so that the other may marry her. However,
	when the Prophet David expressed this desire, he did not realize
	that the expression of such a desire could be without compulsion and
	coercion when expressed by a common Man, but it could never be so
	when expressed by a king. When his attention was drawn to this
	aspect of the matter through a parable, he gave up his desire
	immediately, and the thing was forgotten. But afterwards when,
	without any desire or planning on his part, the woman's husband fell
	martyr on the battlefield, and he married her, the evil genius of
	the Jews started concocting stories and this mischievous mentality
	became even more acute after a section of the Israelites turned
	hostile to the Prophet . Solomon. (Please see E. N . 56 of An-Naml).
	Under these motives the story was invented that the Prophet David,
	God forbid, had seen Uriah's wife washing herself from the roof of
	his palace. He had her called to his house and committed adultery
	with her and she had conceived. Then he had sent Uriah on the
	battle-front to fight the children of Ammon, and had commanded Joab,
	the army commander, to appoint him in the forefront of the battle
	where he should be killed. And when he was killed, he married his
	widow, and from the same woman the Prophet Solomon (peace be upon
	him) was born. The wicked people described all these false
	accusations in their &quot;Holy Book&quot;, so that they should go
	on reading it generation after generation and slandering the two
	most illustrious men of their community, who were their greatest
	benefactors after the Prophet Moses. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A section
	of the commentators of the Qur'an has almost entirely accepted these
	tales that have reached them through the Israelites. They have
	dropped only that pan of these traditions in which mention has been
	made of the accusation of adultery against the Prophet David and the
	woman's having conceived. The rest of the story. as found in the
	traditions reproduced by them is the same as it was well known among
	the Israelites. Another group of the commentators has altogether
	denied that any such act was ever committed by the Prophet David,
	which bore any resemblance with the case of the ewes. Instead of
	this, they have put forward such interpretations of this story as
	are wholly baseless, unauthentic and without relevance to the
	context of the Qur'an itself. But among the Muslim commentators
	themselves there are some who have accepted the truth and the facts
	of the story through the clear references made to it in the Qur'an.
	Here are, for instance, some of their views: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Both
	Masruq and Said bin Jubair have related this saying of Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin 'abbas. &quot;The only thing that the Prophet David
	did was that he expressed his desire before the woman' husband that
	he should give up his wife for him. &quot; lbn Jarir). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">'Allama
	Zamakhshari writes in his commentary Al-Kashshaf. 'The way Allah has
	narrated the story of the Prophet David indicates that he had only
	expressed his desire before the man that he should leave his wife
	for him. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">'Allama
	Abu Bakr al-Jassas has expressed the opinion that the woman was not
	the other man's wedded wife but was only his betrothed. The Prophet
	David had also asked for the same woman's hand in marriage. This
	earned him Allah's displeasure, for he had asked for her hand in
	spite of the fact that another Muslim had already asked for her
	hand, and the Prophet David had several wives already with him in
	his house. (Ahkam al-Qur an). Some other commentators also have
	expressed the same opinion, but this does not entirely conform to
	what the Qur'an has said. The words of the suitor as related in the
	Qur'an are to the effect: &quot;I have only one ewe; he says: Give
	this ewe also in my charge.&quot; The Prophet David also said the
	same thing in his decision: &quot;This person has certainly wronged
	you in demanding your ewe to be added to his ewes.&quot; This
	parable could apply to the case between the Prophet David and Uriah
	only in case the woman was the latter's wife. Had it been the cast
	of asking for the woman's hand when another Muslim had already asked
	for her hand, the parable would have been like this: &quot;I desired
	to have an ewe, ard this man said: Icave this also for me.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Qadi Abu
	Bakr Ibn al-'Arabi has discussed this question in detail in his
	Ahkam al-Qur an and concluded: &quot;What actually happened was just
	that the Prophet David asked one of his men to leave his wife for
	him and made this demand seriously ...The Qur'an does not say that
	the man gave up his wife on this demand and the Prophet David then
	married her and the Prophet Solomon was born of her womb . . . W hat
	displeased Allah was that he asked the woman's husband to leave her
	for him. This act, even if otherwise lawful, was unworthy of the
	office of Prophethood; that is why he earned Allah's displeasure and
	was admonished. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	commentary fits in well with the context in which this story has
	been told. A little consideration of the context shows that it has
	been related in the Qur'an on this occasion for two objects. The
	first object is to exhort the Holy Prophet to patience, and for this
	purpose he has been addressed and told: &brvbar;Have patience on
	what these people say against you, and remember Our servant David.&quot;
	That is, 'You are being accused only of sorcery and lying, but Our
	servant David was even accused of adultery and having a person
	killed willfully, by the wicked people: therefore, bear up against
	what you may have to hear from these people.&quot; The other object
	is to warn the disbelievers to the effect: &brvbar;You are
	committing all sorts of excesses in the world with impunity, but the
	God in Whose Godhead you are committing these misdeeds does not
	spare anyone from being called to account. Even if a favorite and
	beloved servant of His happens to commit but a minor error, He calls
	him to strict accountability. For this very object the Holy Prophet
	has been asked: 'Tell them the story of Our servant David, who was a
	man of high character, but when he happened to commit sin, We did
	not even spare him but condemned him severely' . &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	regard, there is another misunderstanding which mast also be
	removed. The suitor in his parable said that his brother had 99 ewes
	and he had only one ewe, which he was demanding from him. From this
	one gets the idea that perhaps the Prophet David had 99 wives, and
	by having another he wanted to make their number 100. But, in fact,
	it is not necessary that every minor part of the parable should be
	literally applicable to the case between the Prophet David and Uriah
	the Hittite. In common idiom the numbers ten, twenty, fifty, etc.
	are mentioned to express plurality and not to indicate the exact
	number of something. When a man tells another that he has told him
	something ten times over, he only means to stress that he has been
	told that thing over and over again. The same is also true here. By
	means of the parable the suitor wanted the Prophet David to realize
	that he already had several wives with him, and even then he desired
	to have the only wife of the other man. This same thing has been
	cited by the commentator Nisaburi from Hadrat Hasan Basri: `The
	Prophet David did not have 99 wives: this is only a parable.&quot;
	(For a detailed and well-reasoned discussion of this story, see our
	book Tafhimat, vol. II, pp. 29.44).

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One
	section of them interprets them as follows: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Prophet Solomon became so absorbed in reviewing the horses and
	watching their races, that he forgot to offer his 'Asr Prayer, or
	according to some others, to perform certain devotions that he used
	to perform before the sunset. Then when the sun went down, he
	commanded that the horses be brought back, and when they came back,
	the Prophet Solomon started slashing them with the sword, or in
	other words, slaughtering them as a sacrifice to Allah, because they
	had caused him to become heedless of the remembrance of Allah.
	Accordingly, the verses have been translated thus: &quot;And he
	:aid: I so preferred the love of this wealth that I became heedless
	of the remembrance (the 'Asr Prayer, or the special devotions) of my
	Lord till (the sun) went down (behind the veil of the west). (Then
	he commanded : ) bring them back, (and when the horses came back) he
	began to stroke their shanks and necks (with the sword).&quot;
	Although this commentary has been given by some major commentators,
	it is not plausible for the reason that in this the commentator has
	to add three things from himself, which have no basis whatever. In
	the first place, he has to assume that the Prophet Solomon's 'Asr
	Prayer was lost in the occupation, or some special devotions that he
	used to perform at that time, whereas the words of the Qur'an are
	only to the effect: &quot;I so preferred this wealth that I became
	heedless of the remembrance of my Lord. &quot; In these there is no
	ground for taking any word for the `Asr Prayer or the special
	devotions. Secondly, he also assumes that the sun set where as there
	is no mention of the sun whatever. On the contrary, when one reads
	the words hatta tawarar bil-hijab (when they disappeared from sight)
	one's mind automatically turns to as-safinat ul jiyad (well-bred
	horses) which have been mentioned in the preceding verse. Thirdly,
	he also has to assume that the Prophet Solomon did not simply stroke
	the shins and necks of the horses with the hand but stroked them
	with the sword, whereas the Qur'an does not contain the words
	mashan-bis-saif or any other pointer from which stroking may be
	taken to mean stroking with the sword. We have a fundamental
	difference with this kind of the commentary. In our opinion, only in
	four cases it would be right to interpret the words of the Qur'an in
	other than their normally accepted meaning: (1) Either there should
	be a pointer to it in the words of the Qur'an itself; or (2) there
	should be an allusion to it at some other place in the Qur'an; or
	(3) an explanation of it should be afforded by some authentic
	Hadith; or (4) it should have some other reliable source, e.g., if
	it pertains to history, there should be an historical evidence to
	support it; if it pertains to the manifestations of the universe,
	there should be authentic scientific knowledge to substantiate it;
	and if it pertains to the Shari'ah values, the sources of Islamic
	law should explain it. In the absence of any of these, we do not
	think it is right to invent a story on the basis of one's own
	imagination and add it to the words of the Qur'an. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One
	section of the commentators has differed a little from the about
	translation and commentary. They say that the pronoun in both hatta
	tawarat bil-hijab and ruddu-ha 'alayya turns only to the sun. That
	Is, when the `Asr Prayer was lost and the sun went down behind the
	veil of the west, the Prophet Solomon said to the workers of
	destiny: &quot;Turn the sun back so that the `Asr time comes back
	for me to offer the Prayer.&quot; So, the sun retreated and he
	performed his Prayer. Hut this commentary is even more unacceptable
	than the previously mentioned one not because Allah is powerless to
	bring the sun back, but because Allah has made no mention of it
	anywhere. On the contrary, if such a wonderful miracle had actually
	been worked for the sake of the Prophet Solomon, it would certainly
	be worthy of mention. Moreover, if the extraordinary event of the
	returning of the sun after having set had actually taken place; the
	history of the would would never be without it. In support of this
	commentary these commentators _present some Ahadith also in order to
	prove that the returning of the sun after having set is not a rare
	event that happened only once, but it has happened several times.
	There is the mention of bringing the sun back in connection with the
	Holy Prophet's Ascension (mi'raj); the sun was also brought back on
	the occasion of the Battle of the Trench for the Holy Prophet, and
	also for Hadrat `Ali, when the Holy Prophet was sleeping with his
	head in Hadrat Ali's lap and his 'Asr Prayer was lost: then the Holy
	Prophet had prayed for the return of the sun and it had returned.
	But the reasoning from these traditions is even weaker than the
	commentary in support of which they have been presented. Ibn
	Taimiyyah has proved as fabricated the tradition about Hadrat `Ali
	after a detailed discussion of its chains and transmitters. Imam
	Ahmad says it has no basis, and Ibn Jauzi says that it is without
	any doubt a forged tradition. The tradition of the sun's being
	brought back on the occasion of the Battle of the Trench also is
	weak according to some traditionalists and fabricated according to
	others. As far as the tradition regarding the event of the Ascension
	is concerned, the truth about it is that when, the Holy Prophet was
	describing what had happened in the Night of Ascension, before the
	disbelievers of Makkah, they asked for a proof of it. The Holy
	Prophet replied that on the way from Jerusalem he had seen a caravan
	at such and such a place, which had met with such and such an
	accident. When asked as to when that caravan would reach Makkah, the
	Holy Prophet named the day. When the day came, the people of the
	Quraish waited for the caravan all day till the sun began to set. On
	this occasion the Holy Prophet prayed that the sun should not set
	till the caravan had arrived. So, the caravan actually arrived
	before the sunset. Some reporters even have stated that the day on
	that occasion had been enhanced by an hour, and the sun had stood
	still for that long. The question is: Are such traditions sufficient
	evidence for the proof of such an extraordinary event? As we have
	said above, the returning of the sun, or its standing still for an
	hour, is no ordinary event. Had such an event actually taken place,
	it would have become well known the world over. Its mention and
	narration could not remain restricted to only a few reporters. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	section of the commentators interprets these verses as any unbiased
	person would interpret them from these words. According to this
	commentary, what actually happened was this: When a squadron of
	fine, well bred horses was presented before the Prophet Solomon, he
	said: &quot;I love this wealth not for the sake of personal glory or
	desire but for the cause of raising the Word of my Lord.&quot; Then
	he ordered that the horses run a race, and they disappeared from
	sight. Then he ordered that they be brought back, and when they were
	brought back, according to Ibn `Abbas: &quot;He started passing his
	hand on their necks and shanks with love.&quot; This same commentary
	is correct in our opinion, because it corresponds to the words of
	the Qur'an, and for the sake of the full meaning, nothing needs to
	be added to it, which may neither be in the Qur'an, nor in any
	authentic Hadith, nor in the Israelite history. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides,
	one should also note that Allah has narrated this event immediately
	after using epithets like ni'm al-'abd, inna-hu awwab (an excellent
	servant, who turned to His Lord over and over again) for the Prophet
	Solomon. This clearly shows that the object is to relate this
	message: Behold, what a good servant of Ours he was! He loved the
	means of kingly pomp and glory not for the sake of the world but for
	Our sake! After watching - and reviewing his grand cavalry he did
	not boast of his power and grandeur like the worldly rulers but even
	at that time he remembered only Us.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote36sym" HREF="#sdfootnote36anc">36</A>In
	view of the contest, the real object here is to relate this event;
	the preceding verses are an introduction to it. Just as above this,
	first the Prophet David was praised, then the event narrated by
	which he was put to temptation, then it was said that Allah Almighty
	does not spare even such a beloved servant from accountability, then
	about his noble nature it was said that as soon as he was warned of
	the temptation, he repented and bowed before Allah and withheld
	himself from the act, so also here the sequence is like this: First,
	the Prophet Solomon's high rank and his deep sense of devotion has
	been mentioned, then it is said that he also was put to the test,
	then it has been stated that when a mere body was placed on his
	throne, he immediately felt warned on his error, and pleading the
	forgiveness of his Lord, withdrew from the act, because of which he
	was involved in the temptation. In other words, Allah by means of
	these two stories wants to impress two things upon the reader
	simultaneously: (1) Not to speak of the common men, even
	high-ranking Prophets were not spared from His strict
	accountability; and (2) the right attitude for man is not to brag
	and feel proud after committing an error, but to bow down humbly
	before his Lord as soon as he realizes his sin. It was the result of
	this attitude that Allah not only forgave the mistakes of those
	illustrious men but blessed them with still more favors and
	kindness. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, the
	question again arises as to what was the temptation in which the
	Prophet Solomon was involved; what is the meaning of placing a mere
	body on his throne, and what was the nature of the warning on the
	occurrence of which he repented? In reply to this the commentators
	have adopted four different points of view: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One
	section of them has related a long story whose details are disputed,
	but their resume is this: The error committed by the Prophet Solomon
	was either that one of his wives continued to worship the idols in
	the palace for forty days and he remained unaware of it, or that he
	remained confined to his residence for a few days and did not attend
	to redressing of the oppressed people's grievances. For this he was
	punished as follows: A satan somehow made away with his ring by
	which he ruled over the jinns, men and wind. As soon as he lost the
	ring he was deprived of his powers and he remained wandering from
	place to place for forty days; in the interval the satan continued
	to rule in the guise of Solomon. The placing of a mere body on
	Solomon's throne implied this very satan, who had sat on his
	-throne. Some people have gone to the extent to say that during that
	period even the chastity of the women in the royal household did not
	remain safe from the satan. At last from his conduct the ministers
	and the chiefs and the scholars of the court began to doubt that he
	was not Solomon. Therefore, when they opened the Torah before him,
	he fled. On the way the ring fell from his hand in the sea, or he
	cast it into the sea himself, and a fish swallowed it. Then, somehow
	the Prophet Solomon came by the fish. When in order to cook it, he
	cut open its belly he found his ring in it. Then, no sooner did he
	get the ring than the jinns and men presented themselves humbly
	before him.--This whole story, from the beginning to the end, is
	nonsensical and absurd, which the converts from among the Jews and
	Christians took from the Talmud and other Israelite traditions and
	spread it among the Muslims. It is strange that some of our well
	known scholars took these traditions as authentic and cited them as
	the explanation of the allusions of the Qur'an, whereas neither is
	there any truth in Solomon's ring, nor could his glorious works be
	attributed to any ring, nor had the satans been given the power that
	they might disguise themselves as Prophets and mislead the people,
	nor can it be imagined about Allah that He would punish a Prophet
	for an error in such a manner as to enable a satan to corrupt and
	destroy a whole community, disguised as a prophet. The Qur'an itself
	repudiates this commentary. In the verses that follow Allah says:
	When Solomon met with the trial, and he asked Our forgiveness for
	it, then We subdued the wind and the satans to him. Hut, on the
	contrary, according to the above commentary, the satans were already
	under his control by virtue of the ring. It is strange that the
	scholars who have made this commentary did not care to consider what
	the subsequent verses say. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second section of them says that a son was born to the Prophet
	Solomon after twenty years. The satans feared that if he became king
	after Solomon, they would continue to remain slaves as they were
	under him. Therefore, they plotted to kill him. When Solomon came to
	know of this plot, he hid the child in the clouds so that he was
	brought up there. This was the temptation in which he was involved:
	he placed reliance on the protection of the clouds instead of having
	trust in Allah. For this he was punished in this way that the child
	died and fell on his throne as a mere body .... This tale also is
	baseless and is expressly against the Qur`an, for in this also it
	has been assumed that the winds and satans were already under the
	Prophet Solomon's control, whereas the Qur'an in clear words has
	stated their subjection to be an event that took place after the
	trial. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	section says that the Prophet Solomon one day swore that he would go
	in to his 70 wives that night, and from each a warrior would be
	born, who would fight in the cause of Allah, but while he said this
	he did not say: Insha Allah: if Allah so wills. Consequently, only
	one wife conceived and from her also a defective child was born,
	whom the midwife brought and placed on his throne. This Hadith has
	been reported by Hadrat Abu Harairah from the Holy Prophet and it
	has been related by Bukhari and Muslim and other traditionists in
	several ways. In Bukhari itself this tradition has been related at
	different places in different ways. At one place the number of the
	wives has been stated as 60 and at others 70 or 90 or 99 or 100. As
	far as the chains of the transmitters are concerned, most of the
	traditions have strong chains, and their authenticity cannot be
	disputed from the point of view of the principles of reporting. But
	the subject-matter of the Hadith is patently against reason, and
	proclaims aloud that such a thing could not have been said by the
	Holy Prophet, as reported. But, on the contrary, he might have
	probably mentioned it as an example of the foolish and nonsensical
	tale-telling of the Jews, and the hearer might have misunderstood
	that the Holy Prophet himself had stated it as an event. To force
	the people to accept such traditions only on the strength of their
	chains of transmitters would be making religion a matter of mockery
	and jest. Everyone can calculate for himself that even in the
	longest night of winter the interval between the `Isha` and the Fajr
	Prayers cannot be of more than ten to cloven hours. If the minimum
	number of the wives be 60, it would mean that the Prophet Solomon
	(peace be upon him) went on having intercourse with them
	continuously for 10 to 11 hours that night at the rate of six wives
	per hour, without having a moment's rest. Is it practically
	possible? And can it be expected that the Holy Prophet might have
	related it as an event? Then in the Hadith nowhere has it been said
	that the body that had been placed on Solomon's throne, as stated in
	the Qur'an, implied the malformed child. Therefore, it cannot be
	claimed that the Holy Prophet had narrated this event as a
	commentary of this verse. Furthermore, though it is understandable
	why the Prophet Solomon asked for Allah's forgiveness on the birth
	of the child, one fails to understand why, along with the prayer for
	forgiveness, he prayed: &quot;My Lord, grant me a kingdom as may
	belong to no one else after me. &quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	commentary which Imam Razi has preferred is this: The Prophet
	Solomon was afflicted with a serious disease, or on account of an
	impending danger his body had been reduced to a mere skeleton. But
	this commentary also does not conform to the words of the Qur'an.
	The Qur'an says: &quot;We put Solomon to the test and placed a mere
	body on his throne. Then he turned (to Allah). &quot; From these
	words no one can understand that the mere body implied the body of
	the Prophet Solomon himself. They clearly show that putting to the
	test implied some error that. he happened to commit. On this, the
	way he was given the warning was that a mere body was placed on his
	throne, and when he realized his error he turned to Allah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As a
	matter of fact, this is one of the most difficult places of the
	Qur'an, and we do not find any indisputable ground for giving a
	definite and absolute commentary of it. But if the words of the
	Prophet Solomon's prayer: &quot;My Lord, forgive me, and grant me a
	kingdom as may belong to no one else after me,&quot; are read in the
	light of the Israelite history, it appears that probably he
	cherished in his heart the desire that his son should succeed him on
	the throne so that His kingdom and sovereignty should continue in
	his own race after him. This same thing has been called a
	&quot;temptation&quot; for him by Allah, and he realized this when
	his heir Rehoboam grew up into an unworthy young man, whose ugly
	manners clearly foretold that he would not be able to sustain the
	mighty kingdom of the Prophets David and Solomon (peace be upon
	them) even for a few days. &brvbar;Placing a mere body on his
	throne&quot; probably means that the son whom he wanted to succeed
	him on the throne, was an unworthy person. Therefore, he restrained
	his desire, asked for Allah's forgiveness and prayed that the
	kingdom should end with him, and he would curb his desire to have it
	continued in his dynasty. The Israelite history also shows the same
	thing. The Prophet Solomon did not make any will about his
	successor, nor made it binding for the people to obey a particular
	person. After him his ministers put Rehoboam on the throne, but not
	long afterwards ten tribes of Israel took northern Palestine and
	broke away, and only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the throne
	of Jerusalem.</P>

	he repents and bows down before his Lord humbly, he is blessed with
	such bounties as the Prophets David and Solomon were blessed with.
	The prayer that Solomon had made after seeking Allah's forgiveness,
	was literally fulfilled and Allah actually granted him a kingdom as
	had neither been granted to anyone before him nor bestowed on anyone

	careful study of these words shows that the Prophet Job during
	illness had been annoyed with somebody (according to traditions, his
	wife) and sworn to beat him or her by giving so many stripes. When
	Allah restored him to health and the anger of the illness was gone,
	he became worried as how to fulfill the oath. For if he carried out
	the oath, he would be inflicting pain on an innocent person, and if
	he did not, he would be committing the sin of breaking the oath.
	Allah took him out of the difficult situation by the Command: &quot;Take
	a broom containing as many sticks of straw as the number of the
	stripes you had sworn to give;then strike the person just once with
	the broom so as both to fulfill your oath and to avoid giving undue
	trouble to the person concerned.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	jurists hold the view that this concession was specially meant for
	the Prophet Job, and some others think that other people also can
	take advantage of it. The first view has been cited by Ibn 'Asakir
	from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas and by Abu Bakr al-Jassas from
	Mujahid, and Imam Malik also held the same view. The second view has
	been adopted by Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad,
	Imam Zufar and Imam Shafe' i. They say that if a person, for
	instance, has sworn to give his servant ten stripes, and afterwards
	combines ten whips and strikes him only once in a way that some part
	of each whip strikes him, his oath will be fulfilled. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Several
	Ahadith show that the Holy Prophet, in order to inflict the
	prescribed punishment on a fornicator who was too ill or too weak to
	receive a hundred stripes, also adopted the method taught in this
	verse. 'Allama Abu Bakr al-Jassas has related a tradition on the
	authority of Hadrat Said bin Sa'd bin 'Ubadah to the effect that a
	person from the tribe of Bani Sa`idah happened to commit
	fornication, and he was a sick man and a mere skeleton. Thereupon
	the Holy Prophet commanded: &quot;Take a branch of the palm tree
	with a hundred twigs on it and strike him therewith once and for
	all. &quot; (Ahkam al Qur 'an). In Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i,
	Ibn Majah, Tabarani, 'Abdur Razzaq and other collections of Hadith
	also there are several Ahadith supporting it, which conclusively
	proves that the Holy Prophet had devised this very method for
	inflicting the prescribed punishment on a sick or weak person.
	However, the jurists lay the condition that some part of every twig
	or piece of straw must strike the culprit, and even if only one
	stroke, it must also hurt the culprit; that is, it is not enough
	just to touch him but he must be struck with it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here the
	question also arises that if a person has sworn to do something and
	afterwards he comes to know that it is improper, then what should he
	do? Then is a tradition from the Holy Prophet to the effect that in
	such a case one should do only that which is better, and the same is
	the atonement for the oath. Another tradition from him says that one
	should do something good instead of the improper thing and should
	atone for his oath. This verse supports this second tradition, for
	if keeping oneself from an improper thing had been the atonement for
	the oath, Allah would not have told the Prophet Job to strike the
	broom once and fulfill his oath, but would have said: &quot;Do not
	do this improper thing, and your restraint itself is the atonement
	for your oath.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	verse also shows that it is not necessary to carry out immediately
	what one has sworn to do. The Prophet Job had sworn an oath in the
	state of illness, and fulfilled it after complete recovery, and not
	immediately even after the recovery. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people have regarded this verse as an argument for practicing
	pretense under the Shari'ah. No doubt it was a pretense which the
	Prophet Job had been taught but it had been taught not for evading
	anything obligatory but for avoiding an evil. Therefore, in the
	Shari 'ah those pretenses only are lawful, which are adopted to
	remove injustice and . sin and evil from one's own self or from
	another person, otherwise practice of pretense is highly sinful if
	it is employed for the purpose of making the unlawful lawful, or
	evading the obligatory duties and righteous acts. For a person who
	practices pretense for such impious objects, in fact, tries to
	deceive God. For example, a person who transfers his wealth to
	another before the completion of a year on it, only for the purpose
	of evading payment of the Zakat on it, not only evades an obligatory
	duty, but also thinks that Allah will get deceived by this trickery
	and will consider him as relieved of his duty. The jurists who have
	mentioned such pretenses in their books, do not mean that one should
	practice them in order to evade the Shari ah obligations, but they
	mean to point out that a judge or ruler cannot take to task a person
	who escapes the consequences of a sin under a legal cover for his
	affair is with Allah.&nbsp;

	favors and bounties with which the Prophet Job was honored and
	blessed in his life. So much so that if they get involved in a moral

	actual words in the Text mean &quot;Those who possessed the hands
	and the insights.&quot; The hand, as we have explained above,
	implies power and capability. To describe these Prophets as &quot;men
	of great power and insight&quot; means that they were practical men:
	they possessed great power to obey Allah and to abstain from sin,
	and they had made great efforts for raising the Word of Allah in the
	world. &quot;Insight&quot; does not mean eye-sight but the vision of
	the heart and mind. They could sec and recognize the Truth: they did
	not live like the blind in the world, but they walked the straight
	path of guidance, in the full light of knowledge, with open eyes. In
	these words, there is a subtle allusion to this also that the people
	who commit evil, and have gone astray, arc in fact, deprived of the
	hands as well as the eyes. He only, who works in the cause of Allah,
	possesses the hands, and he, who distinguishes between the light of
	the Truth and the darkness of falsehood, only possesses the eyes.&nbsp;

	there was no tinge of-worldliness in their character: all their

	They remembered it themselves and urged others also to remember it.
	That is why Allah exalted them to such high ranks as have never been
	attained by those who remained absorbed in earning worldly wealth
	and prosperity. In this regard, one should also keep in view the
	subtle point that Allah here has only used the word ad-dar (that
	abode, or the real abode) for the Hereafter. This is meant to
	impress the truth that this world is no abode for man, but only a
	passage and a rest house, which man has to leave in any cast. The
	real abode is the abode of the Hereafter. He who works to adorn that
	abode is the man of insight and such a one should inevitably be a

	Prophet AI-Yas`a has been mentioned only twice in the Qur'an, in
	Surah Al-An'am: 86 and here, without any detail about him; only his
	name appears in the chain of the Prophets. He was one of the major
	Prophets of Israel, belonged to Abel Meholah, a place on the river
	Jordan, and is well known as Elisha among the Jews and Christians.
	When the Prophet Elijah (peace be upon him) had taken refuge in the
	Sinai peninsula, he was commanded to return to Syria and Palestine
	for some important works, one of which was to prepare the Prophet
	Elisha for his successorship. Accordingly, when the Prophet Elijah
	came to his town, he found Elisha ploughing with twelve yoke of oxen
	before him, and he with the twelfth. The Prophet Elijah passed by
	him and cast his mantle upon him, and he left the oxen and followed
	him. (I Kings, 19:15-21). He remained under training with him for 10
	to 12 years. Then, when Allah recalled Elijah, he was appointed
	Prophet in his place. (2 Kings, oh.2). The Second Book of the Kings
	gives a detailed account of the Prophet Elisha (chs., 2 to 13),
	which shows that when the Israeli state of northern Palestine got
	lost in polytheism and idol-worship and moral evils, Elisha a
	pointed Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, king of
	Israel against the royal dynasty due to whose misdeeds those evils
	had spread in Israel. Jehu not only put an end to Baal-worship, but
	also condemned to death every member of the wicked family, including
	its children. But in spite of this reformist revolution the evils
	that had taken root in Israel could not be completely eradicated,
	and after the death of the Prophet Elisha they assumed enormous
	proportions; so much so that the Assyrians began to invade Samaria
	whenever they pleased. (For further details, see E.N. 7 of Surah
	Bani-Isra'il and E. N .'s 70, 71 of Surah As-Saaffat).&nbsp;

	Lord? And does the kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs to
	you, and is it for you to decide as to who should be appointed God's
	Prophet and who should not be appointed?&quot; The second answer is:
	In this the chiefs of the Quraish have been told: &brvbar;Your
	jealousy, your pride and arrogance against Muhammad (upon whom be
	Allah's peace and blessings) arc similar to the jealousy and
	arrogance of Iblis against Adam (peace be upon him). Iblis also had

	right to appoint anyone He pleases as His Messenger: he disobeyed
