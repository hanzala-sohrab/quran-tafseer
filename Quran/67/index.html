<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
this surah, on the one hand, the teachings of Islam have been
introduced briefly, and, on the other, the people living in
heedlessness have been aroused from their slumber in a most effective
way. A characteristic of the earliest surahs of the Makkan period is
that they present the entire teachings of Islam and the object of the
Holy Prophet's mission, not in detail, but briefly, so that they are
assimilated by the people easily. Moreover, they are particularly
directed to make the people shun heedlessness, to make them think,
and to arouse their dormant conscience. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
the first five verses man has been made to realize that the universe
in which he lives is a most well organized and fortified Kingdom in
which he cannot detect any fault, any weakness or flaw, how ever hard
he may try to probe. This Kingdom has been brought from nothing into
existence by Allah Almighty Himself and All the powers of
controlling, administering and ruling it are also entirely in Allah's
hand and His power is infinite. Besides, man has also been told that
in this wise system he has not been created without a purpose, but he
has been sent here for a test and in this test he can succeed only by
his righteous deeds and conduct. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 6-11, dreadful consequences of disbelief which will appear in the
Hereafter have been mentioned, and the people told that Allah, by
sending His Prophets, has warned them of these consequences in this
very world, as if to say &quot;Now, if you do not believe in what the
Prophets say and correct your attitude and behavior accordingly, in
the Hereafter you will yourself have to admit that you really
deserved the punishment that was being meted out to you.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 12-l4, the truth that has been impressed on the minds is that the
Creator cannot be unaware of His creation, as if to say: &quot;He is
aware of each open and hidden secret of yours, even of the innermost
ideas of your hearts. Hence, the right basis of morality is that man
should avoid evil, fearing the accountability of the unseen God,
whether in the world there is a power to take him to task for this or
not, and whether in the world there is a possibility of being harmed
by such a power or not. Those who adopt such a conduct in the world
alone will deserve forgiveness and a rich reward in the Hereafter.&quot;

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 15-23, making allusions, one after the other to those common
truths of daily occurrence, which man does not regard as worthy of
much attention, he has been invited to consider them seriously. It
has been said: &quot;Look: the earth on which you move about with
full satisfaction and peace of mind, and from which you obtain your
sustenance has been subdued for you by Allah; otherwise this earth
might at any time start shaking suddenly so as to cause your
destruction, or a typhoon might occur, which may annihilate you
completely. Look at the birds that fly above you; it is only Allah
Who is sustaining them in the air. Look at your own means and
resources: if Allah wills to inflict you with a scourge, none can
save you from it; and if Allah wills to close the doors of sustenance
on you, none can open them for you. These things are there to make
you aware of the truth, but you see them like animals, which are
unable to draw conclusions from observations, and you do not use your
sight, hearing and minds which Allah has bestowed on you as men; that
is why you do not see the right way.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 24-27, it has been said: &quot;You have ultimately to appear
before your God in any case. It is not for the Prophet to tell you
the exact time and date of the event. His only duty is to warn you
beforehand of its inevitable occurrence. Today you do not listen to
him and demand that he should cause the event to occur and appear
prematurely before you; but when it does occur, and you see it with
your own eyes, you will then be astounded. Then, it will be said to
you &quot;This is the very thing you were calling to be hastened.&quot;

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
vv. 28-29 replies have been given to what the disbelievers of Makkah
said against the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and his
Companions. They cursed the Holy Prophet and prayed for his and the
believers destruction. To this it has been said: &quot;Whether those
who call you to the right way are destroyed, or shown mercy by Allah,
how will their fate change your destiny? You should look after
yourselves and consider who would save you if you were overtaken by
the scourge of God?You regard those who believe in God and put their
trust in Him as the misguided. A time will come when it will become
evident as to who was misguided in actual truth. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

ponder over it &quot;If the water which has come out from the earth

depends your whole life activity, should sink and vanish underground,
who beside Allah can restore to you this life giving water?&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	had come to them or not, but the object would be to make them
	realize that no injustice had been done to them by casting them into
	Hell. They would try to make them confess that Allah had not kept
	them uninformed and unwarned: He had sent the Prophets to them; He
	had informed them of the truth and of the Right Way; He had warned
	them that if they followed a way other than the Right Way, it would
	lead them to Hell, in which they had been cast. But they had not
	listened to the Prophets. Hence, they rightly deserved the
	punishment which was being meted out to them at that time. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	thing has been pointed out over and over again in the Qur'an that
	the test for which Allah has sent man in the world is not being
	conducted by keeping man absolutely unaware and uninformed of the
	requirements of the test only to see whether he found the right way
	by himself or not; but Allah has made the most appropriate
	arrangements that could possibly be trade of guiding him to the
	Right Way, and it is that He has raised the Prophets and sent down
	the Books. Now the test of man lies in this whether he accepts the
	Prophets and the Books brought by them and adopts the straight way,
	or turns away from them to follow his own desires, whites and
	speculations. Thus, the Prophethood, in fact, is Allah's argument
	which He has established against man and on its acceptance or
	rejection depends his whole future life. No one, after the
	appointment of the Prophets, can present the excuse that he remained
	unaware of the Truth, or that he has been caught and put to the hard
	test unawares, or that he is being punished while he was innocent.
	This theme has been presented in countless different ways in the
	Qur'an; for instance, see Al-Baqarah: 213, and E.N. 230 on it;
	An-Nisa': 41-42, 165 and E N.'s 64 and 208; Al-An`am: 130-131, and

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote18sym" HREF="#sdfootnote18anc">18</A>This
	is the real basis of morality in religion. A person's refraining
	from an evil because it is an evil in his personal opinion, or
	because the world regards it as an evil, or because its commission
	is likely to bring loss in the world, or because it may entail a
	punishment by a worldly power, is a very flimsy basis for morality.
	A man's personal opinion may be wrong, he may regard a good thing as
	bad and a bad thing as good because of some philosophy of his own.
	In the first place, the worldly standards of good and evil have
	never been the same: they have been changing from time to time. No
	universal and eternal standard in the moral philosophies is found
	today, nor has it ever been found before. The fear of worldly loss
	also does not provide a firm foundation for morality. The person who
	avoids an evil because he fears the loss that may result from it for
	himself, cannot keep himself from committing it when there is no
	fear of incurring such a loss. Likewise, the danger of the
	punishment by a worldly power also is not something which can turn a
	person into a gentleman. Everybody knows that no worldly power is
	knower of both the seen and the unseen. Many crimes can be committed
	unseen and unobserved. Then, there are many possible devices by
	which one can escape the punishment of every worldly power; and the
	Laws made by a worldly power also do not cover all evils. Most evils
	are such as do not come within the purview of the mundane laws,
	whereas they are even worse than the evils which they regard as
	punishable. That is why, the Religion of Truth has raised the
	edifice of morality on the basis that one should refrain from an
	evil in fear of the unseen God Who sees man under all conditions,
	from Whose grasp man cannot escape in any way, Who has given man an
	all-pervading, universal and everlasting criterion of good and evil.
	To forsake evil and adopt good only out of fear of Him is the real
	good which is commendable in religion. Apart from this, if a man
	refrains from committing evil for .any other reason or adopts acts
	which in view of their external form are regarded as good acts, his
	these moral acts will not be worth any merit and value in the
	Hereafter, for they are like a building which has been built on
	sand.&nbsp;

	Allah turning his eyes up to heaven whenever he finds himself
	helpless in an affliction. Then whenever a calamity befalls him
	suddenly, he says it has descended from heaven; whenever something
	unusual happens, he says it has come from heaven; and he calls the
	Books revealed by Allah as heavenly Books. Accordingly to a
	tradition-in Abu Da'ud, a person came before the Holy Prophet with a
	black slave-girl and said: &quot;It has become obligatory on me to
	set a slave free; can I set this slave-girl free? Holy Prophet asked
	the slave-girl, &quot;Where is Allah?&quot; She pointed heavenward
	with her forger. The Holy Prophet asked, &quot;Who am I?&quot; She
	first pointed towards him and then towards the heaven, by which she
	obviously meant to say: &quot;You have come from Allah.&quot;
	Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Set her free; she is a
	believer.&quot; (A story closely resembling this has been narrated
	in Mu'watta, Muslim and Nasa'i also). About Hadrat Khawla bint
	Tha`Ibah.. Hadrat 'Umar once said to the people: &quot;She is the
	lady whose complaint was heard above the seven heavens&quot; (In
	E.N. 2 of Surah al-Mujadalah, we have given full details concerning
	this). All this clearly shows that it is natural with man that
	whenever he thinks of God, his mind turns to the heaven above and
	not to the earth below. In view of this very thing the words man
	fis-samaa. (He Who is in the heaven) have been used about Allah.
	There is no room here for any doubt that the Qur'an regards Allah
	Almighty as living in the heaven. In fact, there cannot be any basis
	for this doubt, for in the very beginning of this Surah Al-hulk, it
	has been stated: &quot;He Who created seven heavens, one above the
	other&quot;, and in Al-Baqarah it has been said &quot;You will face
	Allah in whatever direction you turn your face.&quot; (v : 115)&nbsp;
