<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">and the Hereafter and for their utter
refusal to accept and acknowledge his claim to Prophethood. In the
end, they have been plainly warned that the Prophet whom they are
mocking and ridiculing will overwhelm them in spite of their power
and self and they will find the army of Allah encamping in the very
courtyards of their houses (vv. 171-179. This notice was given at a
time when there appeared no chance whatever of the Holy Prophet's
success and triumph. The Muslims (who have been called Allah's army
in these verses) were being made the target of severe persecution.
Three- fourth of their population had already emigrated and hardly 40
to 50 of the Companions were left with the Holy Prophet in Makkah who
were experiencing all sorts of the excesses with utter helplessness.
Under such circumstances, in view of the apparent conditions, no one
could believe that the Holy Prophet and the handful of his ill
equipped Companions would ultimately attain dominance. The people
rather thought that the new movement would end and be buried in the
ravines of Makkah. But hardly 15 to 16 years had passed when on the
conquest of Makkah precisely the same thing happened of which the
disbelievers had been forewarned. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

beliefs; they have been informed of the evil consequences of their
deviations, which have been contrasted with the splendid results of
the faith and righteous acts. Then, in continuation of the same,
Precedents from past history have been cited to show how Allah had
been treating His Prophets and their followers : how He has been
favoring His faithful servants and punishing their deniers and
rejectors. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
most instructive of the historical narratives presented in this Surah
is the important event of the pious life of the Prophet Abraham, who
became ready to sacrifice his only son as soon as he received an
inspiration from Allah. In this there was a lesson not only for the
disbelieving Quraish, who waxed proud of their blood relationship
with him, but also for the Muslims who had believed in Allah and His
Messenger. By narrating this event they were told what is the essence
and the real spirit of Islam, and how a true believer should be ready
to sacrifice his all for the pleasure and approval of Allah after he
has adopted it as his Faith and Creed. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
last verses of the Surah were not only a warning for the disbelievers
but also a good news for the believers who were passing through
highly unfavorable and discouraging conditions on account of their
supporting and following the Holy Prophet. In these verses they were
given the good news that they should not be disheartened at the
hardships and difficulties they had to encounter in the beginning,
for in the end they alone would attain dominance, and the standard
bearers of falsehood, who appeared to be dominant at the time would
be overwhelmed and vanquished at their hands. A few years later the
turn the events took, proved that it was not an empty consolation but
an inevitable reality of which they had been foretold in order to
strengthen their hearts. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Now tell me what you think of it.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote59anc" HREF="#sdfootnote59sym"><SUP>59</SUP></A>
He said, &quot;My dear father, do as you are being commanded.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote60anc" HREF="#sdfootnote60sym"><SUP>60</SUP></A>
You will find me, if Allah so wills, of the patient.&quot; At last,
when the two had submitted them selves (to Allah) and Abraham had
flung his son down on his brow,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote61anc" HREF="#sdfootnote61sym"><SUP>61</SUP></A>
and We called out,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote62anc" HREF="#sdfootnote62sym"><SUP>62</SUP></A>
&quot;O Abraham! You have indeed fulfilled your vision.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote63anc" HREF="#sdfootnote63sym"><SUP>63</SUP></A>
Thus do We reward the righteous.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote64anc" HREF="#sdfootnote64sym"><SUP>64</SUP></A>
This was indeed a manifest trial.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote65anc" HREF="#sdfootnote65sym"><SUP>65</SUP></A>
And We ransomed his son for a great sacrifice,<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote66anc" HREF="#sdfootnote66sym"><SUP>66</SUP></A>
and left for him praise among posterity for ever. Peace is upon
Abraham. Thus do We reward the righteous. Indeed he was one of Our

among the righteous. And we blessed him as well as Isaac.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote67anc" HREF="#sdfootnote67sym"><SUP>67</SUP></A>

	the whereabouts of the lost properties and articles, and the people
	used to visit them to know the events of their past and future
	lives. These soothsayers claimed that they had some jinns and satans
	under their control, who brought them all sorts of news. In this
	environment when the Holy Prophet was appointed to Prophethood, and
	he began to recite the verses of the Qur'an, which described the
	past history and contained news of the future, and also stated that
	an angel brought him these verses, his opponents immediately branded
	him a soothsayer and started telling others that, like the other
	soothsayers, he too was associated with a satan, who brought him
	news from the heavens, which he presented as revelations from Allah.
	To refute this accusation, Allah says: &quot;The satans have no
	access to heaven. They have no power to hear the conversations of
	the angels and bring its news for others; if by chance a little of
	it enters the ear of a satan, and he tries to bring it down, he is
	followed by a flashing flame.&quot; In other words, it means: &quot;The
	grand system of the universe, which is functioning under the agency
	of the angels has been firmly guarded and secured against every
	interference of the satans. Not to speak of interfering in it, they
	do not even have the power to obtain any kind of information about
	it. &quot; (For further explanation, see AI-Hijr: 17-18 and the

	the question arises: Who was the son whom the Prophet Abraham had
	got ready to offer as a sacrifice, and who had willingly offered
	himself to be slaughtered as a sacrifice? The first answer to this
	question is given by the Bible; and it is this: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;And
	it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and
	said unto him, Abraham: . . . Take now thy son thine only son Isaac,
	whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer
	him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I
	will tell thee of.&quot; (Gen. 22: 1-2). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	statement, on the one hand, it is being said that Allah had asked
	for the offering of the Prophet Isaac, and on the other, that he was
	Abraham's only son, whereas the Bible itself, at other places,
	conclusively states that the Prophet Isaac was. not the only son of
	the Prophet Abraham.Consider the following statements of the Bible: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Now
	Sarai, Abram's wife bore him no children: and she had an handmaid,
	an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar. And Sarai said unto Abraham,
	Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee,
	go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her. And
	Abraham hearkened to the voice of Sarai. And Sarai Abraham's wife
	took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after Abraham had dwelt ten years
	in the land of Canaan, and gave her husband Abram to be his wife.
	And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived.&quot; (Gen .16: 1-4) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;And
	the angel of the Lord said unto her, Behold thou art with child, and
	shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael.&quot; (16: 11) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;And
	Abraham was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bore Ishmael to
	Abraham.&quot; (16: 16). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;And
	God said unto Abraham, `As for Sarai thy wife, ..... I will bless
	her and give thee a son also of her: . . . . . and thou shalt call
	his name Isaac . . .. . . which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this
	set time in the next year And Abraham took Ishmael his son and
	......every male among the men of Abraham's house; and . .. . .
	circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God
	had said unto him. And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when
	he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. And Ishmael his son
	was thirteen years old, when he was circumcised in the flesh of his
	foreskin. &quot; (Gen. 17: 15-25). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;And
	Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto
	him. &quot; (Gen. 21: 5). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	brings out the contradictions of the Bible. It is evident that for
	14 years the Prophet Ishmael was the only son of the Prophet
	Abraham. Now if the offering had been asked of the only son, it was
	not of Isaac but of Ishmael, for he alone was the only son; and if
	the offering of Isaac had been asked, it would be wrong to say that
	the offering of the only son had been asked. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the Islamic traditions, and they contain great
	differences. According to traditions cited by the commentators from
	the Companions and their immediate followers, one group of them is
	of the opinion that the son was the Prophet Isaac, and this group
	contains the following names: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	`Umar, `Hadrat `Ali, `Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Hadrat `Abbas bin
	`Abdul Muttalib, Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas, Hadrat Abu Hurairah,
	Qatadah, `Ikrimah, Hasan Basri, Said bin Jubair, Mujahid, Sha`bi,
	Masruq, Makhul, Zuhri, `Ata, Muqatil, Suddi, Ka'b Ahbar, Zaid bin
	Aslam, and others. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	group says that it was the Prophet Ishmael, and this group contains
	the names of the following authorities: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hadrat
	Abu Bakr, Hadrat 'Ali, Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar, Hadrat 'Abdullah

	Mujahid, Yusuf bin Mahran, Hasan Basri, Muhammad bin Ka`b al-Qurzi,
	Sha`bi, Said bin al-Musayyab, Dahhak, Muhammad bin 'Ali bin Husain
	(Muhammad alBaqir), Rabi` bin Anas, Ahmed bin Hanbal, and others. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">When
	compared, the two lists will be seen to contain several common
	names: this is due to the reason that from the same person two
	different views have been reported. For example, from Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin `Abbas, `Ikrimiah has related the saying that the son
	was the Prophet Isaac, but from him again `Ata' bin Abi Rabah
	relates: &quot;The Jews claim that it was Isaac, but the Jews tell a
	tie. &quot; Likewise. from Hadrat Hasan Basri, one tradition is to
	the effect that the Prophet Isaac was the son meant to be made the
	offering, but `Umar bin `Ubaid says that Hasan Basri had no doubt
	regarding that the son whom the Prophet Abraham had been commanded
	to offer as a sacrifice was the Prophet Ishmael (peace be upon him).
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	diversity of tradition has resulted in the diversity of opinion
	among the scholars of Islam. Some of them e.g. Ibn Jarir and Qadi
	`Iyad, have expressed the firm opinion that the son was the Prophet
	Isaac. Others, like Ibn Kathir have given the verdict that it were
	the Prophet Ishmael. There ware others who are un-certain and
	wavering, e.g. Jalaluddin Suyuti. However, a deep inquiry into the
	question establishes the fact that the son intended to be offered as
	a sacrifice was the Prophet Ishmael. The following are the
	arguments: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) As
	stated by the Qur'an above, at the time of his emigration from the
	country, the Prophet Abraham had prayed for a righteous son and in
	answer to it, Allah had given him the good news of a clement boy.
	The context shows that this prayer was made at a time when he was
	childless, and the boy whose good news was given was his first-born
	child. Then, this also becomes obvious froth the Qur'anic story that
	when the child grew up to boyhood, he was inspired to offer him as
	an offering. Now, it is established beyond any doubt that the
	Prophet Abraham's first-born son was the Prophet Ishmael and not the
	Prophet Isaac. The Qur'an itself has stated the order between the
	two sons, thus: &quot;All praise be to Allah Who has given me sons
	like Ishmael and Isaac in my old age.&quot; (Ibrahim: 39). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	words used in the Qur'an with regard to the Prophet Isaac while
	giving the good news of his birth are: &quot;And they gave him the
	good news of the birth of a son, possessing knowledge, ('alim). &quot;
	(AdhDhariyat: 28 &quot;Do not be afraid: we give you the good news
	of a son, possessing knowledge.&quot; (AI-Hijr: 53). But the son,
	the good news of whose birth has been given here; has been called a
	clement (halim) son. This shows that the two sons had distinctive
	qualities, and the offering had been asked of the clement son and
	not of the son possessing knowledge. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) Along
	with giving the good news of the birth of the Prophet Isaac in the
	Qur'an, the good news of the birth of a grandson like Jacob was also
	given: 'Then We gave her the good news of Isaac, and after Isaac of
	Jacob.&quot; (Hud: 71). Now obviously, if about the son along with
	the news of whose birth the news of a worthy son to be born to him
	had also been given, the Prophet Abraham was shown a vision that he
	was sacrificing him, he would never have understood that he was
	being inspired to offer that very son as an offering. 'Allama Ibn
	Jarir contends that the Prophet Abraham might have been shown this
	vision at a time when Jacob had already been born to the Prophet
	Isaac. But this is, in. fact, a very weak reply to the argument. The
	Qur'an says: 'When the boy became able to work with his father,&quot;
	then he was shown the vision Anyone who reads these words with an
	unbiased mind will have the image of an 8 to 10 years lad beforc
	him. No one can imagine that these words had been used about a young
	man having children. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4)
	Allah, at the end of the story, says: &quot;We gave him the good
	news of Isaac, a Prophet among the righteous.&quot; This clearly
	shows that it was not the same son, whom he had been inspired to
	offer as a sacrifice; but before this the good news of some other
	son had been given; then when he grew up and became able to work
	with his father, it was commanded to sacrifice him. Afterwards, when
	the Prophet Abraham came through this test successfully, he was
	given the good news of the birth of another son, the Prophet Isaac
	(may peace be upon him). This order of the events conclusively
	proves that the son whom the Prophet Abraham had been commanded to
	sacrifice was not Isaac but another son who had been born several
	years beforc him, 'Allama Ibn Jarir rejects this express argument,
	saying that in the beginning only the good news of the birth of the
	Prophet Isaac had been given. Then, when he became ready to be
	scarificed for the sake of Allah's approval and pleasure, it was
	rewarded in the form of the good news of his Prophethood. But this
	reply to the argument is weaker still. If it had really been so,
	Allah would not have said: &brvbar;We gave him the good news of
	Isaac, a Prophet among the righteous,&quot; but &quot;We gave him
	the good news that this same son of yours would be a Prophet among
	the righteous.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5)
	Authentic traditions confirm that the horns of the ram which was
	slaughtered as a ransom for the Prophet Ishmael remained preserved
	in the Holy Ka'bah till the time of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Zubair.
	Afterwards when Hajjaj bin Yusuf besieged Ibn Zubair in the Ka'bah
	and demolished the Kab'bah, the horns also were destroyed. Both Ibn
	'Abbas and 'Amir Sha'bi; testify that they had seen the horns in the
	Ka'bah. (Ibn Kathir). This is a proof of the fact that the event of
	the sacrifice had taken place in Makkah and not in Syria, and
	concerned the Prophet Ishmael. That is why a relic of it had been
	preserved in the Holy Ka'bah built by the Prophets Abraham and
	Ishmael. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) The
	Arab traditions confirmed that this event of the sacrifice had taken
	place in Mina (near Makkah), and it was not only a tradition but
	practically also it had been a part of the Hajj rites for centuries.
	Even until the time of the Holy Prophet people used to offer the
	animal sacrifice in Mina at the place where the Prophet Abraham had
	offered the sacrifice. Afterwards when the Holy Prophet was raised
	as a Prophet, he also maintained and continued the same tradition;
	so that even till today sacrifices are offered in Mina on the 10th
	of Dhil-Hajj. This continual practice of 4,500 years or so is an
	undeniable proof of the fact that the heirs to the tradition of
	sacrifice made by the Prophet Abraham have been the descendants of
	the Prophet Ishmael and not of the Prophet Isaac. There has never
	been any such tradition among the descendants of the Prophet Isaac
	according to which the whole community might have offered the
	sacrifice at one and the same time and regarded it as a continuation
	of the sacrifice made by the Prophet Abraham. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In the
	face of such arguments it appears strange how the idea of the
	Prophet Isaac's being the son offered as the sacrifice spread among
	the Muslim community itself. If the Jews might have tried to
	attribute the honor to their ancestor, the Prophet Isaac, by
	depriving the Prophet Ishmael of it, it would be understandable. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But the
	question is: How did a large number of the Muslims come to accept
	this wrong notion? A very satisfactory answer to this question has
	been given by 'Allama Ibn Kathir in his commentary. He says: &quot;The
	reality is known to Allah alone but it appears that all the sayings
	(in which the Prophet Isaac has been mentioned as the son offered as
	a sacrifice) are related from Ka`b Ahbar. This man, when he became a
	Muslim in the time of Hadrat 'Umar, used to relate before him the
	contents of the ancient Jewish and Christian scriptures, and Hadrat
	'Umar would hear them. On this basis, the other people also began to
	listen to him, and started relating every mixture of the truth and
	falsehood that they heard from him, whereas this Ummah did not stand
	in need of anything whatever from the store of his knowledge and
	information.' 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	thing is further explained by a tradition from Muhammad bin Ka'b
	al-Kurzi He says that once during his presence the question whether
	the son offered as a sacrifice was the Prophet Isaac or the Prophet
	Ishmael arose before Hadrat 'Umar bin 'Abdul `Aziz. Among them at
	that time was a person who had been a Jewish scholar but had become
	a sincere Muslim afterwards. He said, &quot;O Commander of the
	Faithful! By God it was Ishmael, and the Jews know it, but claim on
	account of their jealousy of the Arabs that it was the Prophet
	Isaac.&quot; (Ibn Jarir). When the two things are put side by side,
	it becomes evident that actually it was the Jewish propaganda that
	spread among the Muslims who have always been unbiased in scholastic
	literary matters, a large number of them accepted the statements of
	the Jews as a historic truth, which they presented as historical
	traditions with reference to the ancient scriptures, and did not
	realize that these were based on prejudice instead of knowledge.&nbsp;

	sentence throws light on the real object for which this event of the
	Prophet Abraham's sacrifice has been related here. From the race of
	his two sons arose two great nations in the world. First, the
	children of Israel, from whose house two major religions (Judaism
	and Christianity) emerged, which dominated and won over large human
	populations. Second, the children of Ishmael, who were the religious
	leaders and guides of All the Arabs at the time of the revelation of
	the Qur'an, and the tribe of Quraish of Makkah at that time held the
	most important position among them. Whatever eminence these two
	branches of the offspring of the Prophet Abraham attained became
	possible only on account of their connection and relation with the
	Prophet Abraham and his two illustrious sons; otherwise, God alone
	knows how many such families have arisen in the world and been
	assigned to oblivion. Now, Allah relates the most glorious event of
	the history of this family and makes both its branches realize that
	whatever honor and eminence they have attained in the world, has
	been due actually to the great traditions of God-worship and
	sincerity and obedience, which were set by their ancestors, the
	Prophets Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac (may peace be upon them all).
	He tells them: `The great blessings which We bestowed on them, were
	not bestowed arbitrarily and haphazardly: We did not just pick out a
	person and his two sons blindly and blessed them, but they gave
	definite proofs of their loyalty and faithfulness to their real
	Master and then became deserving of His favors. Now, you cannot
	become entitled to those favors merely on the basis of your pride of
	descent, for We shall see who among you is righteous and who is

	Prophet Elias was from among the Israelite Prophets. He has been
	mentioned only twice in the Qur'an, here and in Surah AI-An'am: 85.
	The present-day scholars have determined his period between 875 and
	850 B.C. He was an inhabitant of Gilead, which in ancient days was
	the territory now under the northern districts of the modern state
	of Jordan, to the south of the River Yarmuk. In the Bible he has
	been mentioned as Elijah the Tishbite. Here is briefly his life
	story: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After the
	death of the Prophet Solomon the Israelite kingdom was broken up
	into two parts due mainly to the unworthiness of his son, Rehoboam.
	One part which consisted of Jerusalem and southern Palestine
	remained with the descendants of the Prophet David, while in the
	second, which comprised northern Palestine, an independent state by
	the name of Israel was established with Samaria as its capital.
	Although conditions in both the states were very bad, the state of
	Israel, from the very beginning, followed the path of depravity due
	to which the evils of polytheism and idol-worship and tyranny and
	wickedness went on increasing and multiplying in it endlessly; so
	much so that when Ahab, the king of Israel, married Jezebel, the
	daughter of the king of Sidon (Lebanon), the mischief reached its
	extremity. Under the influence of this polytheistic princess Ahab
	himself became a polytheist. He built a temple and altar to Baal in
	Samaria, tried his very best to introduce and popularize
	Baal-worship instead of the worship of One God. and consequently,
	offerings began to be made publicly in the name of Baal in the
	Israelite towns and cities. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This was
	the time when the Prophet Elijah (peace be upon him) appeared on the
	scene. He came from Gilead and gave Ahab a notice that in
	consequence of his sins, the land of Israel would go without rain,
	even without the dew. This word of the Prophet of Allah proved to be
	literally true and there fell no rain in Israel for thee and a half
	years. At last, Ahab came to his senses and he got the Prophet
	Elijah searched out But Elijah, before praying for the rain, thought
	it necessary to snake the distinction between Allah, Lord of the
	worlds, and Baal plain before the people of Israel. For this
	purpose, he commanded that the priests of Baal would make an
	offering in the name of their deity, and he also would make an
	offering in the name of Allah, Lord of the worlds, in front of the
	assembled people. Then the one whose offering would be consumed by a
	fire from heaven, without the agency of the human hand, the truth of
	his deity would be established beyond doubt. Ahab accepted this
	proposal. Thus, 850 of the priests of Baal assembled on Mt. Carmel
	to answer the challenge given by the Prophet Elijah. In this
	encounter the Ba'al worshipers were defeated, and the Prophet Elijah
	proved that Baal was 'a false god, and the real God is the One God
	alone who had appointed him as His Prophet. After this, Elijah got
	the priests of Baal slaughtered in front of the same assembly of the
	people; then he prayed for the rain, and his prayer was immediately
	answered and the whole land of Israel was saturated with water 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">But,
	despite these miracles, Ahab could not shake off the influence of
	his polytheistic wife. Jezebel turned hostile to the Prophet Elijah
	and she hoped that he would be put to death just as the Baal
	worshipers had been put to death. Under the circumstances the
	Prophet Elijah was compelled to leave the country and he remained
	lodged in a cave at the foot of Mt. Sinai for several years. The
	lamentation that he made to Allah, on this occasion, has been
	related in the Bible, in these words: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">'The
	children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine
	altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only,

	10). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">About the
	same time Jehoram, the ruler of the Jewish state of Jerusalem,
	married the daughter of Ahab, the king of Israel, and under her
	polytheistic influence the same evils that had spread in Israel also
	began to spread in Judah. The Prophet Elijah carried out his
	prophetic duty again and wrote a letter to Jehoram, the following
	words of which have been reported in the Bible: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Thus
	saith the Lord God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked
	in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king
	of Judah. But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and
	hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring,
	like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy
	brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself:
	Behold,with a great plague will the Lord smite thy people, and thy
	children, and thy wives, and all thy goods: And thou shalt have
	great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out
	by reason of the sickness day by day.&quot; (2 Chronicles, 21:
	12-15). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Whatever
	the Prophet Elijah had prophesied in this letter proved true. First,
	the kingdom of Jehoram was destroyed by the external invaders, and
	the enemies even carried away his wives, then he himself died of the
	disease of the bowels. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A few
	years later the Prophet Elijah again went to Israel and constantly
	tried hard to bring Ahab, and after him his son, Ahaziah, to the
	right path, but the evil that had taken root in the house of the
	royal family of Samaria could not be eradicated. At last, due to the
	curse of the Prophet the family of Ahab met its doom, and then Allah
	recalled his Prophet from the world.

	ba'al means master, chief and possessor. This word was also used for
	husband, and has been used in this sense at several places in the
	Qur'an itself, e.g. in Surah AI-Baqarah: 228, An-Nisa': 127, Hud: 72
	and An-Nur: 31. However; in the ancient times the Semetic nations
	used it in the meaning of deity or lord; they had even given the
	name of Baal to a special god. The chief male god of the
	Phoenicians, in particular, was Baal and their chief goddess was
	Ashtoreth, his wife. The scholars differ as to whether Baal meant
	the sun or Jupiter, and Ashtoreth the moon or Venus. In any case,
	historically it is certain that Baal worship was prevalent from
	Babylon to Egypt throughout the Middle East, and the polytheistic
	communities of the Lebanon and Syria and Palestine, in particular,
	had become its devotees. When the Israelites settled in Palestine
