theme of this Surah indicates, and traditions support it, that it was
revealed after the treaty of Hudaibiyah at the end of 6 A. H. or in
the beginning of 7 A. H. That is why it deals with those problems
that arose from this treaty. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

but the Quraish spurred by their enmity, prevented him from its
performance, though it was utterly against all the ancient religious
traditions of Arabia. After a good deal of hard and harsh
negotiations, a treaty was concluded at Hudaibiyah according to which
it was agreed that he could perform </FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">`Umrah</FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
the following year. That was a very appropriate occasion for teaching
the Muslims the right way of performing a pilgrimage to Makkah with
the true Islamic dignity, and enjoining that they should not prevent
the disbelievers from performing pilgrimage to Makkah as a
retaliation for their misbehavior. This was not difficult at all as
many disbelievers had to pass through Muslim territory on their way
to Makkah. This is why the introductory verses deal with the things
connected with pilgrimage to Makkah and the same theme has been
resumed in vv. 101-104. The other topics of this Surah also appear to
belong to the same period. </FONT></SPAN>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
continuity of the subject shows that most probably the whole of the
Surah was revealed as a single discourse at one and the same time. It
is also possible that some of its verses were revealed at a later
period and inserted in this Surah at different places where they
fitted in. But there appears to be not the least gap anywhere in the
Surah to show that it might have comprised two or more discourses. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
Surah was revealed to suit the requirements of the changed conditions
which were now different from those prevailing at the time of the
revelation of Al-i-'Imran and An- Nisa. Then the shock of the
set-back at Uhd had made the very surroundings of Al-Madinah
dangerous for the Muslims, but now Islam had become an invulnerable
power and the Islamic State had extended to Najd on the east, to the
Red Sea on the west, to Syria on the north and to Makkah on the
south. This set-back which the Muslims had suffered at Uhd had not
broken their determination. It had rather spurred them to action. As
a result of their continuous struggle and unparalleled sacrifices,
the power of. the surrounding clans, within a radius of 200 miles or
so, had been broken. The Jewish menace which was always threatening
Al-Madinah had been totally removed and the Jews in the other parts
of Hijaz had-become tributaries of the State of Al-Madinah. The last
effort of the Quraish to suppress Islam had been thwarted in the
Battle of the Ditch. After this, it had become quite obvious to the
Arabs that no power could suppress the Islamic movement. Now Islam
was not merely a creed which ruled over the minds and hearts of the
people but had also become a State which dominated over every aspect
of the life of the people who lived within its boundaries. This had
enabled the Muslims to live their lives without let or hindrance, in
accordance with their beliefs. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Another
development had also taken place during this period. The Muslim
civilization had developed in accordance with the principles of Islam
and the Islamic viewpoint. This civilization was quite distinct from
all other civilizations in all its' details, and distinguished the
Muslims clearly from the non Muslims in their moral, social and
cultural behavior. Mosques had been built in all territories, prayer
had been established and' Imam (leader) for every habitation and clan
had been appointed. The Islamic civil and criminal laws had been
formulated in detail and were being enforced through the Islamic
courts. New and reformed ways of trade and commerce had taken the
place of the old ones. The Islamic laws of marriage and divorce, of
the segregation of the sexes, of the punishment for adultery and
calumny and the like had cast the social life of the Muslims in a
special mold. Their social behavior, their conversation, their dress,
their very mode of living, their culture etc., had taken a definite
shape of its own. As a result of all these changes, the non-Muslims
could not expect that the Muslims would ever return to their former
fold. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Before
the treaty of Hudaibiyah, the Muslims were so engaged in their
struggle with the non-Muslim Quraish that they got no time to
propagate their message. This hindrance was removed by what was
apparently a defeat but in reality a victory at Hudaibiyah. This gave
the Muslims not only peace in their own territory but also respite to
spread their message in the surrounding territories. Accordingly the
Holy Prophet addressed letters to the rulers of Iran, Egypt and the
Roman Empire and the chiefs of Arabia, inviting them to Islam. At the
same time the missionaries of Islam spread among the clans and tribes
and invited them to accept the Divine Way of Allah. These were the
circumstances at the time when Al-Ma'idah was revealed. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

the Believers are the Jews and the mushriks; and you will find that
the nearest in friendliness to the Believers are those, who say, &quot;We
are Christians. &quot; This Is because there are among them some
pious scholars and monks and because they are free from pride. When
they listen to that which has been sent down to the Messenger, you
see their eyes overflow with tears because of the Truth they
recognize therein. They spontaneously say, &quot;Our Lord, we have
believed; therefore, write down our names with those who bear witness
to it.&quot; And they say, &quot;Why should we not believe in Allah
and accept the Truth that has come to us, when we are eager that our

But if it is discovered that the two had been guilty of the same sin,
then two other better qualified witnesses than the former, from among
those who were deprived of their right, should come forward and
testify upon oath, by Allah, &quot;Our testimony is truer than their
testimony, and we have not made any transgression in our testimony:
we shall be among the unjust, if we do so.&quot; It is expected that
in this way the people will give only true evidence: or, at least,

	them easily. Therefore the Muslims were enjoined not to molest them
	when they were proceeding to the House of Allah, even though they
	were idolaters and at war with them. Like wise, the Muslims should
	not attack them during the months of Hajj nor snatch from them those
	animals, which they were taking to the House of Allah as offering.

	this connection, it should be understood well that the limits
	prescribed by the Law for making eatables lawful or unlawful are not
	laid down from the point of view of physical health but from the
	moral and spiritual points of view. As regards the matters
	concerning physical health, these have been left to man's own

	things are useful or harmful for his physical health and nourishment
	and the Law does not take any responsibility for his guidance in

	to be made unlawful, but there is absolutely no mention of this or
	other deadly things in the Qur'an or the Traditions. The Law is only
	concerned about what is morally or spiritually harmful or beneficial
	and also about the right or wrong means for obtaining lawful things.
	It is obvious that man has no means of finding out these things by
	himself and is consequently liable to commit errors in this matter
	without the guidance of the law. For whatever has been prohibited,
	has been prohibited because it is harmful from the point of view of
	cleanliness or morality or belief. On the contrary, whatever has

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One might
	ask why Allah has not explained the philosophy underlying the
	prohibition of certain things for the clear understanding of the
	people. This is because it is not possible for mankind to comprehend
	this. For instance, it is not possible for us to make a research
	into the nature of moral evils that are produced by eating carrion,
	blood or the flesh of swine, nor is it easy to find out how they are
	produced and to what extent, because we have no means of measuring
	or weighing morality, It is, therefore, obvious that, even if their

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This is

	in the Qur'an as the book of God and in the Holy Prophet as His
	Messenger and in Allah as All Knowing and All-Wise, will observe the
	prescribed limits whether one understands their philosophy or not.
	On the other hand, if one does not believe in this basic creed, one
	will avoid only those things which are harmful according to human
	knowledge and will go on suffering from the consequences of those
	which man has not learned to be harmful.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) It
	prohibits the pagan ways of taking omens from a god or a goddess and
	the like, about one's fortune or getting indications as to the
	future or deciding disputes. For instance, the pagan Quraish of
	Makkah had specified the idol of Hubal at the Ka`abh for this

	presenting the offering to the priest and performing certain
	ceremonies, pull out an arrow and regard the words engraved on it as
	the verdict of Hubal. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	second category consists of the superstitious ways and irrational
	methods of taking decisions about the daily problems of life for
	anything regarded as portending good or evil regardless of reason or
	knowledge, or of finding out future events blindly by the ominous
	significance of particular things, circumstances, occurrences or
	proceedings or the like. In short, it included all the so-called
	arts of prediction and prophetic significance. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	third category includes all kinds of gambling in which the
	distribution of things etc., is based on mere chance and not on
	merit, right, service or other rational considerations. For
	instance, all the schemes of lottery which entitle a certain holder
	of a ticket to a prize merely on chance, and at the expense of a
	large number of other holders of such tickets, or the award of
	prizes for cross-word puzzles in which a certain answer out of a
	large number of correct ones corresponds, by mere chance, to the
	answer that has been ear-marked as correct for the purpose - all
	these things are unlawful.

	one simple form of casting lots is lawful in Islam, when there are
	two equally lawful things or rights and there is no rational method
	of deciding between them. Supposing two persons have equal rights,
	in every respect, to something and the judge finds no rational
	justification to give preference to either of the disputants,
	neither of whom is willing to forgo his rights. In such a case, if
	they mutually agree, the matter may be decided by casting lots, or
	if one has to choose one of the two lawful things and is in
	difficulty in regard to the choice, one is allowed to cast lots for
	it. The Holy Prophet adopted this method on such occasions as
	required a choice to be made between two persons with equal rights,

	refers to the Jews and the Christians. Permission to marry only
	their women has been given, and that , too, with the provision that
	they should be chaste (muhsanat). There is a difference of opinion
	in the details of the application of this permission. According to
	Ibn 'Abbas, a Muslim may marry from among the women of the People of
	the Book who are the subjects of the Islamic State, but is not
	permitted to marry from among the women of the People of the Book
	living in the regions which are at war with the Islamic State or are
	living in a territory of the unbelievers. The Hanafis differ a
	little from this and consider it undesirable, though not unlawful,
	to marry women from among the People of the Book living in a foreign
	territory. On the contrary, Said bin Musayyib and Hasan Basri are of
	the opinion that the Command is of a general nature; therefore there
	is no need to make any kind of distinction between the People of the
	Book whether they are subjects of an Islamic State or living in a
	foreign territory.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides
	this there also is a difference in the interpretations of the word
	muhsanat. According to Hadrat `Umar, it refers to virtuous and
	chaste women. That is why he excludes characterless women of the
	People of the Book from this permission. Hasan, Sha`bi and Ibrahim
	Nakha`i are of the same opinion and the Hanafis also approve of
	this. On the other side, Imam Shafi`i takes it to mean free women of
	the people of the Book as opposed to the slave-girls from among
	them.&nbsp;

	comprehending at one and the same time all the aspects of human
	problems so as to weigh and estimate their relative importance and
	judge between the different courses before him. That is why,
	whenever he has tried to plan a way of life for himself, he has
	utterly failed to do justice to his own self or tiffs society, and
	made a mess of all his affairs and problems, and created a state of
	chaos everywhere. This is because with his narrow vision he becomes
	so absorbed in one basic need out of many and one problem out of
	many that he loses sight of all others and neglects them
	intentionally or un-intentionally. As a result of this, life loses
	its balance and begins to rush towards one extreme. When this state
	of affairs becomes unbearable, one of the neglected needs or
	problems takes hold of man and life begins to rush towards another
	extreme with the same destructive result. In this way, life goes on
	running from one extreme to the other and man never finds the
	balanced middle way which is &quot;The Right Way&quot;, because all
	the ways planned by him keep him running in wrong directions from
	one extreme to the other.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As has
	been pointed out, man cannot plan that right way which may lead him

	mankind. He sent His Messengers with Guidance to lead mankind to the
	Right Way to real success in this world and in the Hereafter; and
	the one who loses this way will go wrong here and act wrongly, and
	inevitably go to Hell in the next world, for all the wrong ways lead
	to Hell. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this
	connection it will be pertinent to point out the blunder that has
	been committed by some so-called philosophers. When they noticed
	that human life was continually running between two extremes, they
	came to the wrong conclusion that the Dialectical process was the
	natural way of the evolution of human progress. According to them,
	internal contradictions are inherent in all things and the struggle
	between these opposites and their synthesis constitutes the contents
	of the process of development. They apply the Dialectical methods to
	the study of social life and come to the wrong conclusion that the
	same is the right way of evolution. Accordingly they start with a
	thesis of an extreme nature for the solution of a problem and go on
	rushing away from the Right Way towards one extreme till they
	discover, to their dismay, that in this process gross injustice has
	been done to some other equally important problems. Then they turn
	back with the antithesis of the first theory and presume that the
	synthesis of the two will help evolve its right solution. Though it
	is true that the struggle between the two opposite theories helps
	them approach the Right Way, yet they cross it rapidly towards the
	other extreme because they do not believe in Divine Guidance which
	alone can make one firmly adhere to it. Then they do gross justice
	to same other problems and the same process is repeated over and
	over again. If such short-sighted philosophers had not rejected God
	and religion and trade an impartial study of the Qur'an, they would
	have discovered to their joy that the Right Way is the straight
	path, leading to the human evolution, and not the myriad crooked and
	curved paths. Thus they would have saved mankind from continually
	rushing aimlessly between extremes.

	is wrong to presume that the title Nasara pertains to Nazareth, the
	home of Jesus. In fact, its root is nusrat (help). The Christians
	have been called ,Nasara (helpers) for the reason that when Jesus
	asked, &quot;Who will be my ansar (helpers) in the cause of Allah'?&quot;
	his disciples answered, &quot;We are ansar in the cause of Allah.&quot;
	(LXI : 14). The Christian writers got the wrong impression that the

	apparent similarity between Nasara and Nazarenes, a sect of early
	Christians who were contemptuously called Nazarites. But the Qur`an
	makes it clear here that the Christians themselves said, &quot;We

	themselves Nazarites. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this

	had not come to found a new religion after his own name but to
	revive the same religion that Moses and the other Prophets before
	and after him had brought. Therefore he did not form any new
	community other than that of the Israelites; nor they lived like a
	new one; nor adopted a distinctive name or symbol for themselves.
	They used to go to the Temple (Jerusalem) for prayer along with the
	other Jews and considered themselves to be bound by the Mosaic Law.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Later on
	the process of separation began froth two sides. On the one side St.
	Paul, a follower of the Prophet Jesus, put an end to the observance
	of the law and declared that the only thing needed for salvation was
	belief in Messiah. On the other side, the Jewish rabbis cut off the
	followers of Christ by declaring theta to be a misguided sect. But
	in spite of this separateness, at first the sect bore no distinctive
	name. The followers of Christ called themselves by different names,
	such as disciples, brethren, believers, saints etc. (Please refer to
	the Acts, 2 : 44, 4: 32, 9 : 26, 11 : 29, 13 : 52, IS : 1 &amp; 23;
	Romans, 15 : 45, and Corinthians, 1:12). But the Jews called them
	Galileans or the sect of the Nazarenes contemptuously and tauntingly
	(Luke, 13 : 2, The Acts, 24 : 5) because of the Roman Province of
	Galilee in which Nazareth, the birth place of Jesus, was situated.
	These satirical names, however, did not become current as the
	permanent names of the followers of Christ. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As a
	matter of fact, the disciples were called Christians first in
	Antioch, when Barnabas and Paul went there in 43-44 A.D. to preach
	the Gospels. (The Acts, 11: 26). Though this name was also given to
	them contemptuously by their enemies, yet, by and by, their leaders
	accepted this, saying, &quot;If ye be reproached for the name of
	Christ, happy are ye,.....if any man suffers as a Christian, let him
	not be ashamed.&quot; (I Peter, 4: 16). At long last, they lost the

	had been given to them by their enemies.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thus it
	is clear that the Qur'an has not called them Christians because of
	the contempt associated with it, but has called them Ansar (helpers)
	in order to remind them that they were the name-sake of those
	disciples of Jesus who had responded to his invitation and said, &quot;We
	are helpers of Allah.&quot; Is it not an irony that instead of being
	grateful to the Qur'an for giving them their name, the Christian

	dirhams, and (d) Hadrat `Aishah one-fourth of a dinar. That is why

	to the minimum limit for theft for the cutting off of a hand.
	According to Imam Abu Hanifah, it is ten dirhams and according to

	will save himself from the wrath of Allah, Who will cleanse him of
	his sin. On the contrary, if a person does not repent and reform
	himself even after his hand has been cut off, but goes on nurturing
	evil thoughts, this clearly shows that he has not cleansed his heart
	even after this severe punishment. Therefore he shall deserve the
	wrath of Allah as he did before his hand was cut off. That is why
	the Qur'an exhorts such a person to beg for the forgiveness of Allah

	According to the Torah (Deut. 22 : 23-24), their punishment was that

	couple. They all but one answered that it was so. The one who had
	kept quiet was Ibn surya, who was considered to be the greatest

	discards the Law of Allah and judges by the law formulated by
	himself or by others is guilty of three crimes. First, he practices
	disbelief by his rejection of the Law of Allah. Secondly, he becomes
	guilty of injustice because he violates the Law of Allah which is
	perfectly just and equitable. Thirdly, he became a transgressor
	(Fasiq against Allah, because, in spite of being Allah's servant, he

	a person shall be a disbeliever, an unjust person and transgressor,
	in the fullest sense of the words. However, if one holds the belief
	that the Law of Allah is right, but in practice gives judgment
	against it, such a one shall not be outside the Muslim community,
	but shall be considered to be mixing his belief with disbelief,
	injustice and transgression. Likewise, if one rejects the Law of

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote81sym" HREF="#sdfootnote81anc">81</A>Here
	is the answer to the above-mentioned question: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) It is
	wrong to infer from the above-mentioned differences in the details
	of the different Laws that they have been derived from different
	sources and have different origins. As a matter of fact, they all
	have come from Allah, Who prescribed different regulations to suit
	different communities and different ages. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) No
	doubt Allah could have prescribed one and the same Law for all human
	beings from the very beginning and made them a single community but
	He did not do so for many good reasons. One of these reasons is to
	test people whether they obey or not what is given to them by Allah.
	Those people, who understand the real nature and spirit of the
	Divine Way and the position of the regulations in it and are not
	prejudiced, will recognize and accept the Truth in whatever form it
	comes. Such people will never hesitate to submit to the new
	regulations sent by Allah to replace the former ones. On the
	contrary, those, who do not understand the true spirit of the Way,
	but consider the regulations and their details alone to be the Way
	and who have become static and prejudiced because of their own
	additions to it, will reject every new thing that comes from Allah
	to replace what they already possess. And such a test was essential
	to distinguish the two above-mentioned kinds of people; therefore
	different laws and regulations were prescribed. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) As
	the real object of all the laws is the cultivation of virtues, Allah
	has commanded the people to excel one another in virtues, without
	paying heed to the apparent differences in different Laws. This is
	why those people, who keep in view the real aim of the Law, should
	advance towards it on the lines indicated by the Divine Laws and
	regulations. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) As
	regards the differences, which have been produced by the prejudices,
	obduracies and wrong mental attitudes, these can neither be resolved
	in polemical symposiums nor on the battlefield, but will be decided
	by Allah Himself in His Final Judgment. Then the Reality will be
	revealed and the people will come to know the amount of truth or
	falsehood that lay hidden in the arguments in which they were
	engaged throughout their lives.&nbsp;

	the first followers of the Messiah conformed to .a great extent to
	the reality they themselves had witnessed and to what had been
	taught to them by their Prophet. But later on the Christians went so
	much beyond the limits in showing reverence and veneration to the
	Messiah and were so influenced by the fancies and philosophical
	interpretations of their beliefs that they invented a new religion
	that had nothing in common with the real teachings of the Messiah.
	In this connection, the following extracts from Jesus Christ, by the
	Rev. Charles Anderson Scott (Encyclopedia Britannica, Fourteenth
	Edition) are worth reading :- 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Apart
	from the Birth stories at the opening of Matthew, Mark and Luke (the
	exact significance of which in this respect is ambiguous) there is
	nothing in these three Gospels to suggest that their writers thought
	of Jesus as other than human, a human being specially endued with
	the spirit of God and standing in an unbroken relation to God which
	justified His being spoken of as the &quot;Son of God&quot;. Even
	Matthew refers to him as a carpenter's son and records that after
	Peter had acknowledged Him as Messiah he &quot;took him and began to
	rebuke Him&quot; (Matt. XVI. 22). And in Luke the two disciples on
	the way to Emmaus can still speak of Him as &quot;a Prophet mighty
	in deed and word before God and all the people&quot; (Luke, XXIV.
	19). It is very singular that inspite of the fact that before Mark
	was composed, &quot;the Lord&quot; had become the description of
	Jesus common among Christians; he is never so described in the
	second Gospel (nor yet in the first, though the word is freely used
	to refer to God). All three relate the Passion of Jesus with a
	fullness and emphasis of its great significance, but except the
	&quot;ransom&quot; passage (Mark, X. 45) and certain words at the
	Last Supper. there is no indication of the meaning which was
	afterwards attached to it. It is not even suggested that the death
	of Jesus had any relation to sin or forgiveness. Had the &quot;ransom&quot;
	saying been suggested by Paul, it would not stand as it does in its
	isolated vagueness.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The same
	author says, &quot;That He ranked Himself as a Prophet appears from
	a few passages such as `I have to go on my way today, tomorrow or
	day after tomorrow, because it cannot be that a Prophet perish out
	of Jerusalem.&quot; (Luke, 13 : 33) He frequently referred to
	himself as &quot;the Son of Man. '...... &quot;Jesus never refers to
	Himself as the &quot;Son of God&quot;, and the title when bestowed
	upon Him by others probably involves no more than the acknowledgment
	that He was the Messiah. But He does describe himself &quot;as the
	Son&quot; absolutely.....Moreover, he uses the word &quot;Father&quot;
	in the same absolute way to define His relationship to God. It is
	conceivable that He did not always realize the uniqueness of this
	relationship, that in early life He thought of the privilege as one
	which He shared with other men, but that experience of life and
	deeper knowledge of human nature forced upon Him the discovery that
	in this He stood alone. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Certain
	words of Peter spoken at the time of Pentecost, `A man approved of
	God,' describe Jesus as He was known and regarded by His
	contemporaries......The Gospels leave no room for doubt as to the
	completeness with which these statements are to be accepted. From
	them we learn that Jesus passed through the natural' stages of
	development, physical and mental, that He hungered, thirsted, was
	weary and slept, that He could be surprised and require information,
	that He suffered pain and died. He not only made no claim to
	omniscience, He distinctly waived it. Indeed any claim to
	omniscience would be not only inconsistent with the whole impression
	created by the Gospels, it could not be reconciled with the cardinal
	experiences of the Temptation, of Gethsemane and of Calvary. Unless
	such experiences were to be utterly unreal, Jesus must have entered
	into them and passed through them under the ordinary limitations of
	human knowledge. subject only to such modifications of human
	knowledge as might be due to prophetic insight or the sure vision of
	God. There is still less reason to predicate omnipotence of Jesus.
	There is no indication that He ever acted independently of God, or
	as an independent God. Rather does He acknowledge dependence upon
	God, by His habit of prayer and in such words as &quot;this kind
	goeth not forth save by prayer&quot;. He even repudiates the
	ascription to Himself of goodness in the absolute sense in which it
	belongs to God alone. It is a remarkable testimony to the truly
	historical character of these Gospels that though they were not
	finally set down until the Christian Church had begun to look up to
	the risen Christ as to a Divine Being, the records on the one hand
	preserve all the evidence of His true humanity and on the other
	nowhere suggest that He thought of Himself as God..... &quot;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;It
	may not be possible to decide whether it was the primitive community
	or Paul himself who first put fully religious content into the title
	&quot;Lord&quot; as used of Christ. Probably it was the former. But
	the Apostle undoubtedly adopted the title in its full meaning and
	did much to make that meaning clear by transferring to &quot;the
	Lord Jesus Christ&quot; many of the ideas and phrases which in the
	Old Testament had been specifically assigned to the Lord Jehovah. He
	gave unto him that name that is above every name the name of &quot;Lord.&quot;
	At the same time by equating Christ with the Wisdom of God and with
	Glory of God, as well as ascribing to Him Sonship in an absolute
	sense, Paul claimed for Jesus Christ a relation to God which was
	inherent and unique, ethical and personal, eternal. While, however,
	Paul in many ways and in many aspects, equated Christ with God, he
	definitely stopped short of speaking of him as God.....&quot; (Pages

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	recognition of Christ as the incarnation of the &quot;logos&quot;
	was practically universal before the close of the 3rd century, but
	His deity was still widely denied and the Arian controversy which
	distracted the Church of the 4th century concerned the latter
	question. At the council of Nicaea in 325 the deity of Christ
	received official sanction and was given formulation in the original
	Nicene creed. Controversy continued for some time, but finally the
	Nicene decision was recognized both in East and West as the only
	orthodox faith. The deity of the Son was believed to carry with it
	that of the Spirit, who was associated with Father and Son in the
	baptismal formula and in the current symbols and so the victory of
	the Nicene Christology meant the recognition of the doctrine of the
	Trinity as a part of orthodox faith. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;The
	assertion of the deity of the Son incarnate in Christ raised another
	problem which constituted the subject of dispute in the
	Christological controversies of the 4th and following centuries.
	What is the relation of the divine and human natures in Christ? At
	the council of Chalcedon in 451 it was declared that in the person
	of Christ are united two complete natures, divine and human, which
	retain after the union all their properties unchanged. This was
	supplemented at the third council of Constantinople in 680 by the
	statement that each of the natures contains a will, so that Christ
	possesses two wills. The Western Church accepted the decisions of
	Nicaea, Chalcedon and Constantinople and so the doctrines of the
	Trinity and of the two natures in Christ were handed down as
	orthodox dogma in West as well as East.......

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Meanwhile
	in the Western Church the subject of sin and grace and the relation
	of divine and human activity in salvation, received special
	attention and finally, at the 2nd Council of Orange in 529, after
	both Pelagianism and semi- Pelagianism had been repudiated, a
	moderate form of Augustinianism was adopted, involving the theory
	that every man as a result of the Fall is in such a condition that
	he can take no steps in the direction of salvation until he has been
	renewed by the divine grace given in baptism, and that he cannot
	continue in the good thus begun except by the constant assistance of
	that grace which is mediated only by the Catholic Church&quot;.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It has
	become very clear from the above quotations from Christian Scholars
	that the first thing which misled the Christians was their
	exaggerated credulity. Accordingly, they went beyond the limits in
	their reverence and love of Christ. That is why they began to apply
	epithets like &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;Son of God&quot; to Jesus
	Christ (Allah's peace be upon him) and to ascribe Divine Attributes
	to him and to invent the Doctrine of Atonement, when, in fact, there
	was absolutely no room, for such things in his teachings. Afterwards
	when they came under the influence of philosophy, they began to put
	forward interpretations to justify the errors of their former
	religious leaders and went on inventing new creeds, one after the
	other, in utter disregard of the real teachings of Jesus Christ,
	merely on the strength of Philosophy and Logic, whereas the right
	thing for them would have been to turn to the real teachings of
	Christ. It is against such wrong beliefs that the Qur'an warns in

	Allah has made unlawful. Therefore if you make a lawful thing

	the Divine Law.&quot; Secondly, &quot;You should not adopt the way
	of asceticism like the Christian monks or the Hindu friars or the
	Buddhist mendicants and the like.&quot; This was meant to warn the
	Muslims against the general tendency, which has always existed among
	the religious-minded people, to consider even the normal satiation
	of the desires of the body and mind to be against spiritual
	progress. They imagine that self-torture, self-denial and abstinence
	are virtues in themselves and that one could not approach God
	without these austerities. As a matter of fact, there were some
	Companions, who had developed such tendencies. When the Holy Prophet
	came to know that some of his Companions had taken vows that they
	would always observe fast during the day and would not go to bed for
	sleep but keep awake and worship God the whole night, and would
	abstain from flesh, fat and women, he forbade them from such
	practices. He said, &quot;I have not ordained such things; your own
	self has rights on you; therefore observe fast and also eat
	easefully. Stand in worship at night and also go to sleep. I myself
	sometimes observe fast and at others I do not. I eat flesh and

	As for me I have not taught you to become monks and hermits. The way
	of life taught by me does neither allow abstention from women nor
	from eating flesh nor retirement and seclusion from the world. The
	Law has prescribed Fasting for self-discipline, and Jihad for the
	same benefits that might be obtained from asceticism. Worship Allah
	and associate none with Him as partner, perform Hajj and `Umrah,
	establish the Salat and pay Zakat and observe the Fasts during the
	month of Ramadan. The people who were doomed before you, were doomed
	because they practiced austerity of their own accord, and when they

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Before
	making wine absolutely unlawful in this verse, two other
	Commandments concerning its prohibition had already been given in
	Al-Baqarah, II: ? 19 and An-Nisa, IV: 43. Before this last
	Commandment was given, the Holy Prophet addressed the people in
	order to prepare them for its absolute prohibition. He warned and
	said, 'Allah does not like at all that people should drink wine.
	Probably absolute prohibition will soon be prescribed: therefore
	those who possess wine are advised to sell it. &quot; Some time
	after this, when verse 90 was sent down he declared. &quot;Now those
	who possess wine, can neither drink it nor sell it; they should,
	therefore, throw it away.&quot; Accordingly it was spilt in the
	streets of Madinah to run wastefully. Some people, however, asked
	the Holy Prophet, &quot;May we give it as a present to the Jews?&quot;
	He replied, &quot;The One Who has trade it unlawful has also
	forbidden to give it as a present.&quot; Others asked, &quot;May we
	convert it into vinegar?&quot; He replied, &quot;No, you must spill
	it.&quot; Another asked again and again, &quot;Is one permitted to
	use wine as medicine?&quot; The Holy Prophet emphatically rejected
	this also and said, &quot;No, it is not a medicine but a disease.&quot;
	Yet another asked, &quot;Sir, we live in a place, which is very
	cold, and we have to do tiresome labor. So we drink wine to refresh
	ourselves from fatigue and to keep warm in the cold.&quot; He asked,
	&quot;Is what you drink intoxicant?&quot; The man replied, &quot;Yes.&quot;
	The Holy Prophet replied, &quot;Then refrain from it.&quot; At this
	the man said, &quot;The people of our part of the country will not
	submit to this.&quot; He replied, &quot;If they do not submit to
	this, then go to war with them.&quot;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to a Tradition related by Ibn 'Umar, the Holy Prophet declared,
	&quot;Allah has cursed wine and the one who drinks it and the one
	who serves it and the one who sells it and the one who buys it and
	the one who extracts it and the one who has it extracted and the one
	who carried it and the one for whom it is carried. &quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to another Tradition the Holy Prophet prohibited the Muslims from
	eating the food which is served along with wine. In the initial
	stage of the prohibition, he forbade even the use of those utensils
	which were employed for extracting wine or for drinking it.
	Afterwards when the prohibition had become thoroughly effective, the
	use of such utensils was permitted.

	originally the Arabic word khamr meant only wine made from grapes,
	and it was also applied to the liquors made from wheat, barley,
	dried grapes, dates and honey, the Holy Prophet applied the
	prohibition to all the intoxicants, and there are Traditions that
	clearly support this. For instance, &quot;Every intoxicant is khamr
	and is unlawful.&quot; &quot;Every drink that intoxicates is
	unlawful.&quot; &quot;I prohibit every intoxicant.&quot; In one of
	his Friday sermons, the Caliph `Umar defined khamr as everything
	that dulls the faculty of thinking.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In this

	is unlawful, and if a cup of anything is intoxicant, then a drop of
	it also is unlawful.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">During
	the time of the Holy Prophet. ,there was no fixed punishment for a

	crime. The same was the punishment during the time of Hadrat Abu
	Bakr and the early days of Caliph 'Umar. But when the latter saw
	that the crime was on the increase, he in consultation with the

	Arabia, the Ka`bah was not merely a sacred place of worship, but it
	occupied a central position in the country and because of this and
	of its sanctity, it was the means of stabilizing its economy and
	culture. The people from all over the country came there to perform
	Hajj and `Umrah and the huge gathering helped to create the feeling
	of unity among the Arabs who were otherwise torn by clannish
	strifes. The pilgrims who came from different clans and places met
	together and established cultural relations. Poetic contests helped
	to make their language and literature rich. Trade and commerce which
	were transacted on the occasion helped to satisfy the economic needs
	of the people. The sacred months provided peace to the Arabs for
	four months and this was the only period during which their caravans
	could travel in security from one part of the country to the other.
	The animals dedicated to sacrifice and the collars round their necks
	proved very helpful to the movements of the caravans, for the Arabs
	showed so much reverence for them that none dared touch them with

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote116sym" HREF="#sdfootnote116anc">115</A>This
	verse sets up a new standard of values, which is quite different
	from the standard of those who look only at the outward aspect of
	things. Such people usually judge things by their quantity and not
	by their quality. For instance, one hundred rupees are always
	considered greater in value than five rupees by one who does not
	attach any value to the means by which these might have been
	obtained. But contrary to this evaluation, this verse declares that
	if these one hundred rupees have been obtained by unfair means and
	those five rupees earned by fair means, then the former are less in
	worth because of their impurity than the latter because of their
	purity. According to this standard, it is not the number or the
	quantity of a thing that increases or decreases its true worth but
	the question whether it has been obtained by fair means or foul.
	Obviously, a drop of rose scent has greater value than a heap of
	filth and a cup of pure water is tar greater in worth than a cistern
	full of impure urine. Therefore one who is really wise will always
	remain content with the lawful, though it may appear to be very
	insignificant and worthless, and will never try to grab the
	unlawful, though it might appear to be very alluring and grand.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote117sym" HREF="#sdfootnote117anc">116</A>This
	verse forbids people to ask useless and unnecessary questions
	because some people used to put such questions to the Holy Prophet
	as were of no practical good for mundane affairs nor for spiritual
	up-lift. For example, once a certain person while sitting in a
	gathering asked him, &quot;Who is my real father?'' Likewise,
	sometimes, some people put unnecessary questions concerning legal
	matters so as to get these defined, whereas they had been purposely
	kept undefined for the good of the people. Far example, when Hajj
	was made obligatory by a commandment in the Qur'an a certain person
	heard it, and instantly asked. &quot;Has it been made obligatory to
	perform Hajj every year'&quot; The Holy Prophet did not make any
	reply. The man repeated the question, but he again kept quiet. When
	the man put the question for the third time, he replied, &quot;Woe
	to you! If I had said: 'Yes', the performance of Hajj every year
	would have become obligatory and people like you would have been
	unable to perform it and been guilty of disobedience. &quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The Holy
	Prophet himself forbade people to ask questions for the sake of it
	and to probe into things aimlessly. In a Tradition he warned, &quot;The
	worst offender against the Muslims is the person who asked a
	question about something that had not been made unlawful but was
	made so because of his question.&quot; In another Tradition he said,
	&quot;Allah has prescribed some obligatory duties for you; let not
	these go unfulfilled, and He has made certain things unlawful, so do
	not go near them. He has prescribed certain limits, do not
	transgress them. He has been silent concerning certain things, but
	not because He has forgotten them; so do not try to probe into such
	things.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In these
	two Traditions a warning has been served against a very serious
	matter. There are certain things and commandments which have been
	left vague and without details. This is not because the Law-giver
	had forgo ten to give details or to make them specific but because
	He did not intend to limit these in order to leave a wide scope for
	the people. Therefore if a person goes on creating one issue after
	the other, by putting unnecessary and useless questions and thus
	creates limitations and specifications, he puts the people to
	unnecessary trouble. Likewise if he tries to deduce the details by
	the force of his &quot;reasoning&quot;. and does trot rest content
	till .he has made the vague things specific and the indefinite
	definite. he in reality puts the Muslims in a very awkward position.
	This is because the more details we otter for the Unseen and the
	Next World, the more will be the chances for creating doubts about
	them and, likewise, the more limitations are imposed concerning the
	Commandments, the greater will be the chance for their violation.</P>

	Consequently, they helped to impose upon themselves such
