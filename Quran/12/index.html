<H2 STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>When
and Why Revealed?</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
subject matter of this Surah indicates that it was revealed during
the last stage of the Holy Prophet's residence at Makkah, when the
Quraish were considering the question of killing or exiling or
imprisoning him. At that time some of the unbelievers put this
question (probably at the instigation of the Jews) to test him :&quot;Why
did the Israelites go to Egypt?&quot; This question was asked because
they knew that their story was not known to the Arabs for there was
no mention of it whatever in their traditions and the Holy Prophet
had never even referred to it before. Therefore they expected that he
would not be able to give any satisfactory answer to this question or
would first evade it, and afterwards try to inquire about it from
some Jew, and thus he would be totally exposed. But, contrary to
their expectations, the tables were turned on them, for Allah
revealed the whole story of Prophet Joseph then and there, and the
Holy Prophet recited it on the spot. This put the Quraish in a very
awkward position because it not only foiled their scheme but also
administered a warning to them by aptly applying it to their case, as
if to say, &quot;As you are behaving towards this Prophet, exactly in
the same way the brothers of Prophet Joseph behaved towards him; so
you shall meet with the same end.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<H2 STYLE="font-style: normal; text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Objects
of Revelation</B></FONT></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>From
the above it is clear that this Surah was sent down for two objects: </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
first object was to give the proof of the Prophethood of Muhammad
(Allah's peace be upon him), and that too, the one demanded by the
opponents themselves so as to prove conclusively that his knowledge
was not based on mere hearsay, but was gained through Revelation.
This aspect has been stated explicitly in its introductory verses and
explained plainly in its concluding portion. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
second object was to apply it to the Quraish and warn them that
ultimately the conflict between them and the Holy Prophet would end
in his victory over them. As they were then persecuting their
brother, the Holy Prophet, in the same way the brothers of Prophet
Joseph had treated him. The Quraish were told indirectly that they
would also fail in their evil designs just as the brothers of Prophet
Joseph had failed in his case, even after casting him into the well.
This is because none has the power to defeat the Divine will. And
just as the brothers of Prophet Joseph had to humble themselves
before him, so one day the Quraish shall have to beg forgiveness from
their brother whom they were then trying to crush down. This, too,
has been made quite plain in v. 7: &quot;Indeed there are signs in
this story of Joseph and his brothers for these inquirers from among
the Quraish.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
fact is that by applying this story to the conflict, the Quran had
made a bold and clear prophecy, which was fulfilled literally by the
events that happened in the succeeding ten years. Hardly two years
had passed after its revelation, when the Quraish conspired to kill
the Holy Prophet like the brothers of Prophet Joseph, and he had to
emigrate from Makkah to Al-Madinah, where he gained the same kind of
power as Prophet Joseph had gained in Egypt. Again, in the end the
Quraish had to humble themselves before him just like the brothers of
Prophet Joseph, when they humbly requested, &quot;Show mercy to us
for Allah rewards richly those who show mercy&quot; (V. 88), and
Prophet Joseph generously forgave them, (though he had complete power
to wreak vengeance on them,) saying, &quot; today no penalty shall be
inflicted on you. May Allah forgive you:He is the greatest of all
those who forgive&quot; (V. 92). The same story of mercy was
repeated, when after the conquest of Makkah, the crest fallen Quraish
stood meekly before the Holy Prophet, who had full power to wreak his
vengeance on them for each and every cruelty committed by them. But
instead, he merely asked them, &quot;What treatment do you expect
from me now?&quot; They replied, &quot;You are a generous brother and
the son of a generous brother.&quot; At this, he very generously
forgave them, saying, &quot;I will give the same answer to your
request that Joseph gave to his brothers: &ldquo;...today, no penalty
shall be inflicted on you: you are forgiven.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Moreover,
the Quran does not relate this story as a mere narrative but uses it,
as usual, for the propagation of the Message in the following ways:- </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Throughout
the narrative the Quran has made it clear that the Faith of Prophets
Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph (Allah's peace be upon them all) was
the same as that of Prophet Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) and
they invited the people to the same Message to which Muhammad
(Allah's peace be upon him) was inviting them. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Then
it places the characters of Prophet Jacob and Prophet Joseph side by
side with the characters of the brothers of Joseph, the members of
the trade caravan, the court dignitary; Al Aziz of Egypt and his
wife, the &quot;ladies&quot; of Egypt and the rulers of Egypt and
poses a silent question to the reader, as if to say, &quot;Contrast
the former characters molded by Islam on the bedrock of the worship
of Allah and accountability in the Hereafter with the latter molded
by </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">kufr</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

worship of the world and disregard of Allah and the Hereafter, and

</FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Quran has used this story to bring forth another truth: whatever
Allah wills, He fulfills it anyhow, and man can never defeat His plan
with his counterplans nor prevent it from happening nor change it in
any way whatever. Nay, it often so happens that man adopts some
measure to fulfill his own design and believes that he has done that
very thing which would fulfill his design, but in the end he finds to
his dismay that he had done something which was against his own and
conducive to the Divine purpose. When the brothers of Prophet Joseph
cast him into the well, they believed that they had once for all got
rid of the obstacle in their way but in fact, they had paved the way
for the Divine purpose of making him the ruler of Egypt, before whom
they would have to humble themselves in the end. Likewise, the wife
of Aziz had sent Prophet Joseph to the prison, floating over the
thought that she had wreaked her vengeance on him, but, in fact, she
had provided for him the opportunity for becoming the ruler of Egypt
and for putting herself to the shame of confessing her own sin
publicly. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>And
these are not the solitary instances which prove the truth that even
if the whole world united to bring about the down fall of the one
whom Allah willed to raise high, it could not succeed. Nay, the very
&quot;sure and effective&quot; measures that were adopted by the
brothers to degrade Joseph were used by Allah for the success of
Joseph and for the humiliation and disgrace of his brothers. On the
other hand, if Allah willed the fall of one, no measure, howsoever
effective, could raise him high : nay, it helped to bring about his
fall and the disgrace of those who adopted them. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Moreover,
the story contains other lessons for those who intend to follow the
way of Allah. The first lesson it teaches is that one should remain
within the limits, prescribed by the Divine Law, in one's aims and
objects and measures, for success and failure are entirely in the
hands of Allah. Therefore if one adopts pure aims and lawful measures
but fails, at least one will escape ignominy and disgrace. On the
other hand, the one who adopts an impure aim and unlawful measures to
achieve it, shall not only inevitably meet with ignominy and disgrace
in the Hereafter, but also runs the risk of ignominy and disgrace in
this world. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
second lesson it teaches is that those who exert for the cause of
truth and righteousness and put their trust in Allah and entrust all
their affairs to Him, get consolation and comfort from Him, for this
helps them face their opponents with confidence and courage and they
do not lose heart, when they encounter the apparently terrifying
measures of the powerful enemies. They will persevere in their task
without fear and leave the results to Allah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>But
the greatest lesson this story teaches is that if the Believer
possesses true Islamic character and is endowed with wisdom, he can
conquer a whole country with the strength of his character alone. The
marvelous example of Prophet Joseph teaches us that a man of high and
pure character comes out successful even under the most adverse
circumstances. When Prophet Joseph went to Egypt, he was only a lad
of seventeen years, a foreigner, all alone and without any
provisions; nay, he had been sold there as a slave. And the horrible
condition of the slaves during that period is known to every student
of history. Then he was charged with a heinous moral Crime and sent
to prison for an indefinite term. But throughout this period of
affliction, he evinced the highest moral qualities which raised him
to the highest rank in the country. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
following historical and geographical details will help understand
the story:</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Prophet
Joseph was a son of Prophet Jacob and a grandson of Prophet Isaac and
a great grandson of Prophet Abraham (Allah's peace be upon them all).
The Bible says (and the allusions in the Quran also confirm this)
that Prophet Jacob had twelve sons from four wives. Prophet Joseph
and his younger brother Benjamin were from one wife and the other ten
from the other wives. Prophet Jacob had settled at Hebron (Palestine)
where his father Prophet Isaac and before him Prophet Abraham lived
and owned a piece of land at Shechem as well. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>According
to the research scholars of the Bible, Prophet Joseph was born in or
about 906 B. C. and the incident with which this story begins
happened in or about 890 B. C. He was seventeen when he saw the dream
and was thrown into the well. This well was near Dothan to the north
of Shechem according to Biblical and Talmudic traditions, and the
caravan, which took him out of the well, was coming from Gilead
(Trans-Jordan), and was on its way to Egypt. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At
that time Fifteenth Dynasty ruled over Egypt, whose rulers are known
in history as the Hyksos kings. They belonged to the Arab race, but
had migrated from Palestine and Syria to Egypt in or about 2000 B. C.
and taken possession of the country. The Arab historians and the
commentators of the Quran have given them the name of Amaliq (the
Amalekites), and this has been corroborated by the recent researches
made by the Egyptologists. They were foreign invaders who had got the
opportunity of establishing their kingdom because of the internal
feuds in the country. That is why there was no prejudice in the way
of Prophet Joseph's ascendancy to power and in the subsequent
settlement of the Children of Israel in the most fertile region of
Egypt. They could gain that power and influence which they did,
because they belonged to the same race as the foreign rulers of
Egypt. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
Hyksos ruled over Egypt up to the end of the fifteenth century B. C.,
and practically all the powers remained in the hands of the
Israelites. The Quran has made a reference to this in v. 20 of
Al-Ma'idah: &ldquo;...He raised Prophets among you and made you
rulers.&rdquo; Then there arose a great nationalist movement which
overthrew the power of this dynasty and exiled 250,000 or so of the
Amalekites. As a result of this, a very bigoted dynasty of Copts came
into power and uprooted everything connected with the Amalekites.
Then started that persecution of the Israelites which has been
mentioned in connection with the story of Prophet Moses. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We
also learn from the history of Egypt that the &quot;Hyksos kings&quot;
did not acknowledge the gods of Egypt and, therefore, had imported
their own gods from Syria, with a view to spreading their own
religion in Egypt. This is the reason why the Quran has not called
the king who was the contemporary of Prophet Joseph by the title of
&quot;Pharaoh,&quot; because this title was associated with the
religion of the original people of Egypt and the Hyksos did not
believe in it, but the Bible erroneously calls him &quot;Pharaoh.&quot;
It appears that the editors of the Bible had the misunderstanding
that all the kings of Egypt were &quot;Pharaohs.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
modern research scholars who have made a comparative study of the
Bible and the Egyptian history are generally of the opinion that
Apophis was the Hyksos king, who was the contemporary of Prophet
Joseph. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>At
that time Memphis was the capital of Egypt, whose ruins are still
found on the Nile at a distance of 4 miles south of Cairo. When
Prophet Joseph was taken there, he was 17 or 18 years old. He
remained in the house of Aziz for three years and spent nine years in
prison, and then became the ruler of the land at the age of thirty
and ruled over Egypt independently for eighty years. In the ninth or
tenth year of his rule he sent for his father, Prophet Jacob, to come
from Palestine to Egypt with all the members of his family and,
according to the Bible, settled them in the land of Goshen, where
they lived up to the time of Prophet Moses. The Bible says that
before his death, Prophet Joseph bound his kindred by an oath: &quot;when
you return from this country to the house of your forefathers you
must take my bones out of this country with you. So he died a hundred
and ten years old, and they embalmed him...&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Indeed there are Signs in this story of Joseph and his brothers for
these inquirers. This is how the story begins: his brothers (held a
consultation and) said to one another, &quot;This Joseph and his
brother<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote8anc" HREF="#sdfootnote8sym"><SUP>8</SUP></A>
are dearer to our father than ourselves, even though we are a band.
Truly our father seems to have lost his balance of mind.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote9anc" HREF="#sdfootnote9sym"><SUP>9</SUP></A>
Let us, therefore, kill Joseph or throw him somewhere so that your
father's attention should be turned exclusively towards you. After
this, you should again become righteous people.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote10anc" HREF="#sdfootnote10sym"><SUP>10</SUP></A>
At this one of them said, &quot;Don't kill Joseph; but if you are
bent on doing something, cast him into some dark well. Maybe some
caravan passing by will take him out of it.&quot; After this
consultation, they said to their father, &quot;Father, why is it that
you do not trust in us in regard to Joseph, though we are his sincere
well-wishers? Send him with us tomorrow that he may freely eat and
enjoy sport: we will take good care of him.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote11anc" HREF="#sdfootnote11sym"><SUP>11</SUP></A>
The father replied, &quot;It troubles me that you should take him
away with you, for I fear lest a wolf should eat him up, when you are
off your guard.&quot; They replied, &quot;If a wolf should eat him up
in our company, when we are a band, we shall be worthless people
indeed!&quot; When, after persisting like this, they took him away
with them, and decided to cast him into a dark well, We revealed this
to Joseph: &quot;A time will surely come when you will admonish them
about this act of theirs; now they do not comprehend its
consequences.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote12anc" HREF="#sdfootnote12sym"><SUP>12</SUP></A>
At nightfall they returned to their father, weeping and wailing, and
said, &quot;O father! we were absorbed in running races, and we had
left Joseph with our things, when a wolf came and devoured him: but
you will never believe us, even though we were truthful&quot;. And
(in proof thereof) they had brought his shirt with the false blood
upon it. Hearing this, the father said, &quot;No! your evil souls
have made this heinous act easy for you. I, however, will bear this
patiently with a good grace.<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote13anc" HREF="#sdfootnote13sym"><SUP>13</SUP></A>

Now the woman in whose house he was began to tempt him, and one day
she closed the doors and said, &quot;Come here.&quot; Joseph replied,
&quot;May Allah protect me from this! My Lord has given me a good

indeed he was one of Our chosen servants. At last Joseph and she
raced towards the door one behind the other and she rent his shirt
(pulling it) from behind, and they met her husband at the door.
Seeing him, she cried out, &quot;What punishment does the one deserve
who shows evil intentions towards your wife? What else than this that
he should be put in prison or tortured with painful torment?&quot;
Joseph said, &quot;It was she who solicited me.&quot; At this a

When the husband saw that the shirt was rent from the back, he said,

is that I do not follow the ways of those people who do not believe
in Allah, and deny the Hereafter. I follow the Way of my forefathers,
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: it is not for us to associate anyone with
Allah as partner. This is Allah's bounty upon us and upon all mankind
(that He has not made us the servants of any other than Himself), yet
most people are not grateful. O my fellow prisoners, say, which, is
better: various gods or the One Omnipotent Allah? The gods you
worship other than Him are nothing more than mere names you and your
forefathers have invented, for Allah has sent down no authority for
them. Sovereignty belongs to none but Allah. He has commanded that
you shall not worship anyone but Him. This is the right and straight
Way, but most people do not know this. My fellow prisoners, here are
the interpretations of your dreams. One of you will serve wine to his
lord (the king of Egypt): as for the other, he shall be crucified and
birds will eat of his head. Thus has that matter been decreed whereof

Going to Joseph, he said, &quot;Joseph, O man of righteousness!<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote40anc" HREF="#sdfootnote40sym"><SUP>39</SUP></A>
tell me the meaning of the dream of seven fat cows whom seven lean
cows are devouring, and of seven green ears of corn and seven
withered ones. Maybe I go back to those people and they might
understand it.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote41anc" HREF="#sdfootnote41sym"><SUP>40</SUP></A>
Joseph answered, &quot;You will cultivate land for seven consecutive
years as usual. During this period thrash out of the harvest you reap
only that much grain that might suffice for your food and leave the
rest in the ears. Then, after this, there shall come upon you seven
hard years. Then you will eat up all that corn you might have kept
for that period except that you will have reserved in the store.
After that will come another year in which there will be abundant
rainfall in answer to the prayer of the people and they will press
(juice and oil.)&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote42anc" HREF="#sdfootnote42sym"><SUP>41</SUP></A></FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

When they returned to their father, they said &quot;Dear father now
that corn has henceforth been denied to us, please send our brother
with us so that we may fetch corn, and we take full responsibility
for his safety.&quot; The father replied &quot;Should I entrust him
to you as I entrusted his brother to you before? Allah is the best
Guardian and He is the most Merciful. &quot; When they opened their
saddle-bags they found that their merchandise had also been returned
to them. Seeing this, they cried with joy, &quot;Dear father, look
here! What more do we desire? Here is our merchandise returned to us.
Therefore we will go back and bring provisions of food for our
family; we will take good care of our brother and obtain an extra
camel load of corn. Such an addition will be made easily.&quot; Their
father replied, &quot;I will never send him with you until you give
me a pledge in Allah's name that you shall bring him back to me
unless it be that you are rendered helpless by circumstances.&quot;

Him alone. &quot; And it so happened that when they entered the city

measure proved ineffective against Allah's will. Of course Jacob had

restore it, will be awarded a camel load of corn. I guarantee this.&quot;

come for spreading disorder in this country, and we are no thieves.&quot;
At this, they said, &quot;Very well, what shall be the punishment of
the thief, if you are found to be liars?&quot; They replied, &quot;His

is found in his pack. At home we punish such offenders like this.&quot;<A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote60anc" HREF="#sdfootnote60sym"><SUP>58</SUP></A>

	it should be noted that the response of Prophet Jacob to the dream
	of Prophet Joseph, according to the Bible and the Talmud, was quite
	different froth this: &quot;And he told it to his father, and to his
	brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is
	this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy
	brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?&quot;
	(Gen. 37: 10). Even a little thinking will help one to arrive at the
	conclusion that his reaction as narrated in the Qur'an is worthy of
	the high character of Prophet Jacob and not the one found in the
	Bible and the Talmud. For Prophet Joseph had not expressed any
	personal ambition of his but merely narrated Iris dream. If the
	dream was a true one, and it is obvious that Prophet Jacob
	interpreted it, believing it to be true, there was no reason why he
	should rebuke his own son, for it meant that it was the will of God
	and no his own ambition that he should one day rise to a high rank.
	Can then one expect from any reasonable person, not to mention a
	Prophet, that he would take it ill and rebuke the one who dreamed
	such a dream? And can there ever be such a noble &quot;father&quot;
	who would say bitter and stinging things to his own son for the
	&quot;sin&quot; of telling him a true dream, prophesying his future
	greatness?</P>

	Joseph, and was his junior by many years. Their mother had died at
	the birth of Benjamin. That is why Prophet Jacob paid special
	attention to these two motherless children. Besides, Joseph was the
	only son, in whom he had discerned signs of righteousness and
	capabilities. Accordingly, when Prophet Joseph narrated his dream to
	him, he was all the more convinced of his future greatness, and was
	perturbed at the idea lest his brothers conspired against him out of
	envy, if they came to know of his dream, which was self-explanatory.
	For Prophet Jacob knew that his other ten sons were not of the right
	type, and this was proved by the subsequent events. Therefore,
	naturally he was not happy with them. It is, however, strange that
	the Bible gives a different reason for the envy his brothers bore
	against Prophet Joseph. They were filled with envy against him
	because &quot;Joseph gave unto his father their evil report.&quot;</P>

	order to grasp the full significance of the &quot;grievance&quot;
	the ten sons had against their father for &quot;neglecting&quot;
	them, we should keep in view the conditions of the clannish life. As
	there was no established state, each clan led its own independent
	life side by side with other clans. It is obvious that the power of
	the head of the clan depended entirely on the number of sons and
	grand-sons, and brothers and nephews he had to defend the life,
	honor and property of the family. Therefore, the one leading the
	clannish life naturally paid more attention to one's own grown up
	sons, etc., than to children and women of the family. As Prophet
	Jacob was leading clannish life, these sons of his expected a
	preferential treatment from him, but the Prophet thought otherwise.
	So they remarked, &quot;Truly our father seems to have lost his
	balance of mind; otherwise he could not have neglected us, and loved
	our two younger brothers more than us, for we are strong young men

	pricks him, he tries to soothe it, saying, &quot;Have a little

	caravan came there and pulled him out and carried him to Egypt where
	they sold him. But the Bible says that the brothers cast him into a
	pit: then a company of Ishmaelites came there and they agreed to
	sell him to them. But in the meantime the Midianite merchantmen had
	drawn and lifted up Joseph and sold him to the Ishmaelites who
	brought him into Egypt. (Gen. 37: 25-28). But the authors of the
	Bible forget this sale transaction and further on in v. 36 say that
	Prophet Joseph was sold in Egypt by the Midianites and not by the
	Ishmaelites as stated in v. 28. But the Talmudic version of the
	matter is a little different from this. It says that the Midianites
	drew Joseph up from the pit and carried him along with them. As they
	passed by, the sons of Jacob saw Joseph with them and accused them
	of stealing their slave. At this a furious quarrel arose and they
	were ready to enter upon a bloody fray. But a bargain was concluded
	and the sons of Jacob sold their brother to the Midianites for
	twenty pieces of silver, who afterwards sold him to the Ishmaelites
	for the same amount. Then the Ishmaelites took him into Egypt and
	sold him there. Incidentally, it is this Talmudic version that has

	There was neither any settled state in Canaan and Northern Arabia
	nor had there been any appreciable progress in culture and
	civilization, for it was inhabited by different independent clans
	with no settled government. Thus it is obvious that the training
	that Prophet Joseph had received in Canaan, had equipped him with

	of God-worship and high morality of the family of Prophet Abraham.
	But this was not enough to enable him to direct the affairs of
	Egypt, which was at that time one of the most cultured and civilized

	the commentators and translators are of the opinion that Prophet
	Joseph used (Rabbi &quot;My Lord&quot;) for the master of the house,
	and what he meant to imply by way of argument was this: &quot;My
	Lord has treated me very kindly and kept me well in the house. How
	can I, then, be so disloyal and ungrateful as to commit adultery
	with his wife?&quot; I, however, strongly differ with such a
	translation and commentary. Though the Arabic usage of (rabb) admits
	of such a meaning, I have two strong reasons against this here.
	First, it is far below the dignity of a Prophet to refrain from a
	sin because of the regard he had for some person other than Allah.
	Second, there is not a single instance in the Qur'an that a Prophet
	ever called anyone other than Allah his &quot;rabb.&quot; Prophet
	Joseph himself differentiates between his creed and that of the
	Egyptians making it plain that his ( &quot;rabb&quot; = Lord) was
	Allah, while they had made other human beings their &quot;rabb&quot;.
	Then this verse should be considered from another point of view:
	when (&quot;rabbi&quot;) may also mean &quot;My Lord&quot;, Prophet
	Joseph might have invoked Allah. Why should then one take the other

	Lord's argument&quot; means inspiration from Allah to rouse his
	conscience to the fact that it was not worthy of him to yield to the
	temptation by the woman. As regards the question, &quot;What was
	that argument&quot;, it has been stated in the preceding verse, that
	is, &quot;My Lord has shown much kindness towards me. Should I,
	then, misbehave like this? Such workers of iniquity never fare well.
	&quot; This was the &quot;Divine argument&quot; that saved Prophet
	Joseph in the prime of youth from that great temptation. The
	significance of &quot;Joseph also would have advanced towards her,
	had he not seen his Lord's argument&quot; is this: &quot;Even a
	Prophet like Joseph (Allah's peace be upon him) could not have been
	able to save himself from sin, had not Allah guided him rightly with
	His argument. Incidentally, this verse makes plain the nature of the
	&quot;Immunity&quot; of Prophets from sin. It does not mean that a
	Prophet is infallible and incapable of committing any error, offense
	or sin or doing wrong or making a mistake. What it means is this:
	though a Prophet possesses passions, emotions, and carnal desires
	like other human beings, and is capable of committing a sin, he is
	so virtuous and God-fearing that he never deliberately cherishes any
	evil intentions, for he is endowed with such great arguments from
	his Lord as do not allow the lusts of the flesh over-power the voice
	of his conscience. And if ever he succumbs inadvertently to any of
	the human weaknesses, Allah at once sends a Revelation to him to set
	him on the right path. For the consequences of his error do not
	remain confined to his own person but react on the whole mankind,
	for even his slightest error might mislead the world to the most

	that We may remove indecency and immodesty from him&quot; implies
	two things. First, &quot;It was because of Our grace that he could
	perceive Our argument, and save himself from sin, for We willed to
	remove indecency and immodesty from Our chosen servant. &quot; The
	second meaning is rather deeper: This incident took place in the
	life of Joseph because this was essential for his spiritual
	training: &quot;It was Our will to pass him through this hard test
	so that he should become immune from indecency and immodesty, for he
	would have to apply all his powers of piety to withstand such a
	great temptation, and thus become really so strong as not to yield
	to such things in future as well&quot; . The importance and the need
	of such a hard training becomes quite obvious, if we keep in view
	the moral conditions of the Egyptian society of that period. We can
	have a glimpse of this from vv. 30-32. It appears that the women in
	general and the &quot;ladies&quot; of high society in particular,
	enjoyed almost the same sexual freedom as is rampant today in the
	&quot;civilized&quot; West and in the Westernized East. Allah made
	arrangements for the special training of Prophet Joseph in the house
	of his master because he had to perform his Divine Mission in a
	perverted society, and that too as a ruler and not as a common man.
	It is thus obvious from the behavior of those &quot;ladies&quot; of
	high rank, who did not feel any shame nor modesty in openly admiring
	the beauty of the young slave and from that of the &quot;lady&quot;
	of the house who was not ashamed of confessing openly that she did
	her best to tempt him and would continue to do so, that they would
	have done all they could to allure the young handsome ruler. Thus
	Allah not only made Prophet Joseph strong enough to resist such
	temptations in future by passing him through the hard test, but also
	filled the ladies with despair of gaining any &quot;success&quot; in
	this matter.&nbsp;

	young man of twenty in the prime of his life, who has brought health
	and vigor of youth from the desert into Egypt, after passing through
	the ordeal of forced slavery and exile. Fortune has placed him in
	the house of one of the highest dignitaries in the capital of the
	most civilized country of the world at the time. There this handsome
	young man meets in the prime of life with a strange experience. The

	passionately in love with him and begins to tempt and seduce him.
	Then the fame of his beauty spreads all over the capital and the
	other ladies of the town also become enamored of him. Now this is
	the critical position. He is surrounded on all sides by hundreds of
	beautiful snares that have been spread to entrap and catch him
	unawares. All sorts of devices are employed to excite his passions
	and entice him: wherever he goes he encounters sin lying in ambush
	with all its charms and allurements and waiting for an opportune
	moment to make a surprise attack upon him. Such are the
	circumstances that are tempting him with sin, but the pious young
	man successfully passes through the ordeal, set for him by Satan,
	with the self-control that is praiseworthy indeed. But it is all the
	more praiseworthy that he does not feel any pride for showing such
	extraordinary piety in such trying and tempting circumstances. On
	the other hand, he very humbly invokes his Lord to protect him from
	those traps of sin, for he is afraid of the common human weaknesses
	and cries out, &quot;My Lord, I am weak! I fear lest these
	temptations should over-power me, I would rather prefer imprisonment
	to doing such an evil thing into which they are tempting to ensnare
	me.&quot;</P>

	virtues of which he himself was unaware up to that time. Then he
	himself realized that Allah had endowed him with the high and
	extraordinary qualities of honesty, fidelity, piety, charity,
	righteousness, self-control, balance of mind, and he made full use

	Egyptian rulers were honest in their dishonesty and did not hide the

	Prophet, who had started propagating the Message even in the prison.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As this
	discourse suggests several' very important things, it will be
	worthwhile to consider these one by one: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) This
	is the first occasion on which Prophet Joseph appears to have begun
	the preaching of the true Faith. For before this, the Qur'an reveals
	him in the different stages of his life as a man of high morality
	but does not say anything to show that he conveyed the Message also.
	From this it is clear that those stages were of a preparatory nature
	and the mission of Prophethood was entrusted to him at the stage of
	his imprisonment and this was his first discourse as a Prophet. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Moreover, this was the first occasion when he revealed his identity
	to others. Before this, we find him bearing patiently everything
	that happened to him without revealing anything about his
	relationships with Prophet Abraham and others. He kept silent when
	the caravan made him a slave and carried him to Egypt: when Al-`Aziz
	bought him and when he was sent to prison. As Prophet Abraham, Isaac
	and Jacob (Allah's peace be upon them all) were quite well-known, he
	might have used their names to advantage. The members of the
	caravan, both the Ishmaelites and the Midianites, were closely
	related to his family, and the Egyptians were, at least, familiar
	with the name of Prophet Abraham. Nay, the way in which Prophet
	Joseph mentioned their names in this discourse, shows that the fame
	of. his father, grandfather and great grandfather had reached Egypt.
	But in spite of this, Prophet Joseph did not use their names on any
	of the critical occasions to save himself from the plight in which
	he was placed. This shows that probably he himself knew that these
	things were inevitable for his training for the Mission for which
	Allah had chosen him. Now it was absolutely necessary for him, for
	the sake of his Mission, to reveal this fact in order to show that
	he was not presenting any new Faith but the same Faith that was
	preached by Prophets Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (Allah's peace be upon
	them all). This was necessary because the Message demanded that it
	should not be presented with the claim that it was a new and novel
	thing but that it was the same universal and eternal Truth that has
	always been presented by its bearers.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) This
	teaches us that one can, like Prophet Joseph, carve out a way for
	the propagation of the Message, if one has the intention and the
	required wisdom. The two men pay their homage to him and request him
	to interpret their dreams. In answer to this he says, &quot;I will
	tell their interpretations but Iet me first inform you about the
	source of my knowledge that enables me to understand dreams&quot; .
	Thus he takes advantage of their request and preaches his own Faith
	to them. We learn from this that if a person is imbued with the true
	and strong desire for propagating the Truth, he can very gracefully
	turn the direction of the conversation towards the Message he
	desires to convey. On the contrary, if a person has no strong desire
	for the propagation of the Message, he never &quot;finds&quot; any
	opportunity for it, even though hundred and one such opportunities
	might have come his way which could have been utilized for this
	purpose. But one must be on one's guard to discriminate between the
	right use of an opportunity by a wise man from the crude
	&quot;propagation&quot; of a foolish and un-cultured person, who
	tries to thrust the Message into the ears of unwilling hearers and
	succeeds only in creating aversion for it in their minds because of
	his crude way of presentation.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) This
	also teaches the right procedure that should be followed in
	presenting the Message. Prophet Joseph does not present, at the very
	start, the details of the creed and regulations of the Faith but the
	most fundamental thing that distinguishes a Believer from a
	non-Believer, that is, the distinction between Tauhid and shirk.
	Then he presents it in such a rational manner as cannot fail to
	convince any man of common sense. And his argument must have
	impressed deeply on the minds of the two slaves. &quot;Which is
	better: various gods or One Omnipotent Allah?&quot; They knew it
	from their personal experience that it was much better to serve one
	master than a number of them. Therefore it was far better to serve
	the Lord of the universe than His servants. Moreover, he does not
	invite them directly to accept his Faith and discard their own
	faith, but he very wisely draws their attention to this fact; &quot;This
	is Allah's bounty upon us and upon all mankind that He has not made
	us the servants of any other than Himself, yet most of the people
	are not grateful to Him. Instead of serving Him alone, they invent
	gods for themselves and worship them&quot; . Then it is also
	noteworthy that his criterion of the faith of his addressees is
	based on wisdom and has no tinge of bitterness in it. He says, &quot;The
	gods whom you call `the god of wealth' or `the god of health' or
	'the god of prosperity' or `the god of rain' etc. are mere names you
	have given them without any reality behind them. The real Owner of
	everything is the Supreme Allah Whom you also acknowledge as the
	Creator and the Lord of the whole universe. He has sent no authority
	and given no sanction to anyone for Godhead and worship, but has
	reserved all the powers, all the rights and all the authorities for
	Himself, and commanded, `Serve and worship none but Me.''</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) It
	may also be inferred from this discourse that Prophet Joseph must
	have made full use of this &quot;opportunity&quot; of a decade for
	the propagation of the Message. Some people think that that was the
	only time when he extended the invitation to the Message. This is
	wrong for two reasons. First, it is absurd to imagine that a Prophet
	could have been neglectful of his Mission for a long period. Second,
	it cannot be imagined that the person who availed himself of the
	opportunity when two men approached him for the interpretation of
	their dreams, could ever have passed a decade of imprisonment
	without propagating the Message entrusted to him by his Lord.

	commentators have interpreted it like this: &quot;Satan made Prophet
	Joseph neglectful of his Lord, Allah, so he placed his confidence in
	a man rather than Allah and desired him to mention him to his lord,
	the king, for his release. So Allah punished him by letting him
	languish several years in the dungeon&quot; In fact, such an
	interpretation is absolutely erroneous for as 'Allamah Ibn Kathir
	and some early commentators like Mujahid, Muhammad-bin-Ishaq and
	some others say, the pronoun &quot;him&quot; refers to that person
	who he thought would be released. Therefore it will mean: &quot;Satan
	made him (the would-be free man) so neglectful that he forgot to
	mention him (Prophet Joseph) to his lord (the king).&quot; They also
	cite a tradition in support of their interpretation to this effect.
	The Holy Prophet said, &quot;If Prophet Joseph had not said that
	which he said, he would not have remained in imprisonment for

<DIV ID="sdfootnote43">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote43sym" HREF="#sdfootnote43anc">42</A>There
	is no mention in the Bible and the Talmud of this most important
	part of the story that Prophet Joseph declined to quit the prison
	till his character was cleared. On the other hand, according to the
	Bible, &quot;Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought
	him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved himself, and changed
	his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh&quot; . And the Talmud depicts
	even a more degrading picture of the event. It says, &quot;The king
	ordered that Joseph should be brought before him. But he commanded
	his officers to be careful not to frighten the lad, lest through
	fear he should be unable to interpret correctly. And the servant of
	the king brought Joseph forth from his dungeon, and shaved him and
	clothed him in new garments, and carried him before the king. The
	king was seated upon his throne, and the glare and glitter of the
	jewels which ornamented the throne dazzled and astonished the eyes
	of Joseph. Now the throne of the king was reached by seven steps,
	and it was the custom of Egypt for a prince or noble who held
	audience with the king, to ascend to the sixth step; but when an
	inferior or a private citizen of the land was called into his
	presence, the king descended to the third step and from there spoke
	with him.&quot; (The Talmud, H. Polano, pp. 87-88).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A
	comparison of the degrading picture in the Talmud with this self
	-respecting grand, and noble picture depicted in the Qur'an will
	convince every unbiased critic that the one in the Qur'an is worthy
	of a Prophet of God. Moreover the picture in the Talmud is open to a
	grave objection: Had Prophet Joseph behaved like a frightened and
	cringing lad who was so dazzled by the glitter and glare of the
	jewels of the throne that he bowed to the ground, how was it that
	the king and the courtiers were so impressed by him that they
	declared, &quot;...... the Hebrew has proved himself wise and
	skillful and through his wisdom shall our country be saved the pangs
	of want&quot;? So much so that the king appointed him, without
	demur, as &quot;governor&quot; over the land, &quot;second only to
	himself&quot;. All this shows that by that time he had proved his
	moral and mental superiority and had enhanced it by his refusal to
	quit the prison without proving his innocence. Otherwise, they would
	have never raised him to the highest rank in such a civilized and
	advanced country as Egypt.&nbsp;

	demanded an inquiry into the matter not because he himself had any

	I had been sent to prison, for I do not want to go before the public
	with any blemish or blot on my reputation. Therefore a public

	inquiry and the evidences must have helped to pave the way for
	Prophet Joseph's rise in the land by concentrating the public
	attention on him, especially under the circumstances when the
	inquiry had been demanded by him. He had interpreted the dream of
	the king, when all the wise men, sooth-sayers and the magicians had
	failed. Then he had refused to quit prison even though the king
	himself had ordered that he should be brought before him, and,
	instead of this, demanded an inquiry of the matter which had been
	the cause of his imprisonment. Naturally this thing would have
	filled the people with wonder and they would have been looking
	eagerly for the result of the inquiry. Thus it can be imagined how
	the evidences and the result of the inquiry raised his prestige so
	high that the king and his courtiers declared that he was the only
	fit person to save the country from the coming calamity. It is no
	wonder, then, that Prophet Joseph proposed that all the resources of
	the land should be placed in his hands, and the king accepted this
	proposal as soon as it was made. For, had it been merely the matter
	of the interpretation of a dream, the most he would have deserved
	was some reward and Iris release from prison. But he could not have
	said, &quot;Place the resources of the land in my hands&quot; and
	the king would not have readily acceded to his proposal and given

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote47sym" HREF="#sdfootnote47anc">46</A>Prophet
	Joseph might have said these words in the prison when he came to
	know the result of the inquiry. But some commentators, including
	great scholars like Ibn Taimiyyah and Ibn Kathir, regard this
	sentence to be a continuation of the preceding speech of the wife of
	Al-'Aziz. They argue that this sentence has been placed contiguous
	to her preceding speech without any dividing word between them to
	indicate that her speech had ended at &quot;he is absolutely in the
	right&quot;, and that the succeeding words were spoken by Prophet
	Joseph. They construe that if two speeches made by two different
	persons are placed in contiguity, they must be separated by means of
	Borne definite word, or there must be some definite clue to it. As
	neither of these two things exists in this case, it may rightly be
	construed that the words contained in v. 52 are the continuation of
	her preceding speech in v. 51. I, however, am surprised how a great
	scholar of Ibn Taimiyyah's insight has missed this point that the
	characteristic of a speech is in itself a clear and self-sufficient
	clue. Her confession in v. 51 fits in with her low character, but
	obviously the succeeding dignified and grand speech in v. 52 is too
	high for her. That fits in only with the noble character of Prophet
	Joseph. It is obvious that this must have been uttered by one, who
	was righteous, generous, humble and God-fearing. It is by itself a
	clear evidence that it could not have come out of the mouth of the
	one, who said, &quot;Come here&quot;, and &quot;What punishment does
	the one deserve, who shows evil intentions towards your wife?&quot;
	and &quot;......if he will not yield to my bidding, he shall be cast
	into prison.&quot; On the other hand, such a pure speech fitted in
	with the one who said, &quot;May Allah protect me! My Lord has shown
	so much kindness towards me. Should I, then, misbehave like this?&quot;
	and &quot; my Lord! I prefer imprisonment to that to which they
	invite me. If Thou dost not ward off their cunning devices from me,
	I might be caught in their snares.&quot; Therefore one cannot
	ascribe such a pure speech to the wife of Al-'Aziz unless there is a
	clear clue showing that by that time she had repented and believed
	and mended her ways, but there is no such clue. Thus it is clear
	that this speech must have been made by Prophet Joseph (Allah's
	peace be upon him).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote49sym" HREF="#sdfootnote49anc">47a</A>As
	this verse has given rise to some important questions, let us
	consider these one by one.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The first
	question is: &quot;Was it an application made by Prophet Joseph to
	the king for some post ?&quot; In the light of the preceding
	Explanatory Notes, it would have become obvious that it was neither
	an application nor a request made by an ambitious person who had
	been on the look-out for an opportune moment for its submission, and
	no sooner did the king express his approval of him than he presented
	his request before him. As a matter of fact, this was a sort of
	proposal, giving his assent to the great desire of the king and the
	courtiers that he should be appointed as governor over the land.
	For, according to the Talmud, &quot;the Hebrew has proved himself
	wise and skillful,&quot; and &quot; ....surely there can be none
	more discrete than myself to whom God has made known all these
	things.&quot; The king, his courtiers, his princes, officers, and
	men of rank, had by that time, come to know and recognize his true
	worth and had had experience of his moral superiority during the
	last decade of the vicissitudes of his life. He had proved that
	there was none equal to him in honesty, righteousness, forbearance,
	self discipline, generosity, intelligence and understanding. They
	knew and believed that he was the only one who knew how to guard and
	utilize the resources of the land and could be safely entrusted with
	them. Therefore, as soon as he showed his willingness, they heartily
	put these in his trust. This is also confirmed by the Bible that the
	king had formed a very high opinion of Prophet Joseph. He said to
	his servants, &quot;Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom
	the spirit of God is?&quot; Above all, he said to Prophet Joseph,
	&quot;There is none so discreet and wise as thou art.&quot; (Gen.
	41: 38-39). Accordingly, therefore, the king, of his own accord, set
	him over his house and land. (Gen. 41: 41).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Let us
	now take up the second question: &quot;What was the nature of the
	powers that were entrusted to Prophet Joseph?&quot; This is
	important because those who are not well versed in the Qur'an have
	been misled by the words in this verse and by his subsequent work of
	the distribution of grain. They wrongly conclude from these that
	this post was like the present day posts of a &quot;Treasury
	Officer&quot; or a &quot;Famine Commissioner&quot; or a &quot;Finance
	Minister&quot; etc. etc. In fact, it was none of these, for,
	according to the Qur'an and the Bible and the Talmud, Prophet Joseph
	had been invested with the full powers and privileges of a ruler.
	That is why he sat on the throne ( v. 100) and they used the title
	of malik (king) for him. (v. 72). He himself was grateful to Allah
	for bestowing the kingdom on him. (v. 101). Above all, Allah Himself
	testifies to this fact: &quot;Thus We gave power to Joseph in the
	land, so he had every right to take possession of any piece of it,
	if he so desired.&quot; (v. 56). As regards the Bible, it says, &quot;And
	Pharaoh said unto Joseph, `Thou shalt be over my house, and
	according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: See, I have
	set thee over all the land of Egypt.... and without thee shall no
	man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt,' and called
	Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah (savior of the world).&quot; (Gen.
	41: 40-45). And according to the Talmud, when his brothers returned
	w their father, Prophet Jacob, from Egypt, they said about Prophet
	Joseph, &quot;The king of Egypt is mighty potentate, over his people
	he is supreme; upon his word they go out and upon his word they come
	in; his word governs, and the voice of his master, Pharaoh, is not
	required.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	pertinent question is: What was the object for which Prophet Joseph
	made a proposal for powers in the land? Did he offer his services
	for the enforcement of the laws of a non-Muslim state? Or did he
	intend to establish the cultural, moral and political systems of
	Islam by taking the powers of government in his own hands? As for
	its answer let us quote the comments on this verse (55) by `Allamah
	Zamakhshari in his &brvbar;Kashshaf'. He says, &quot;When Prophet
	Joseph proposed, `Please place all the resources of the country
	under my trust', he meant to get an opportunity for enforcing the
	Commandments of Allah and for establishing truth and justice, and to
	gain that power which is essential for fulfilling the Mission for
	which the Messengers are sent. He did not make this demand for the
	love of kingdom or for worldly desires and ambitions. He did this
	because he knew full well that there was none else who could perform
	that work.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">To be
	frank, the above question leads to very important and basic issues.
	These are: Was Joseph a Prophet of Allah or not ? If he was, does
	the Qur'an put forward such a conception of a Prophet that he
	himself should (as they allege Prophet Joseph did) offer his
	services to a system of unbelief to carry on its work on un-Godly
	principles? Nay, it leads to a more delicate and important question
	Was he a righteous person or not ? and, if he was, could it ever be
	expected that he would (according to their interpretation,)
	practically accept the theory that Sovereignty belongs to the king
	and not to Allah, whereas in the prison he preached, &quot;Sovereignty
	belongs to none but Allah (v. 40) ?&quot; for if, as they interpret,
	he submitted an application for service to the king, it meant that
	he did so against his own principles which he inculcated while in
	prison: &quot; . . . . which is better: various gods or the One
	Omnipotent Allah?&quot;As the king of Egypt was one of the &quot;gods&quot;
	they had set up, so to offer services to carry on the work of the
	un-Islamic system under the existing un-Islamic law would have been
	tantamount to acknowledging the king as his Lord. Are they prepared
	to place Prophet Joseph in that position?</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is an
	irony that such Muslims as interpret this verse in this way, lower
	the character of Prophet Joseph. They have evinced the same
	mentality that the Jews had developed during the period of their
	degeneration. When they became morally and mentally depraved, they
	deliberately began to represent their Prophets and saints as people
	of low character like themselves in order to justify their own
	degraded characters and to make room for excuses for going still
	lower. Likewise, when the Muslims came under the sway of non-Muslim
	governments, they wanted to serve under them, but the teachings of
	Islam and the patterns of their worthy forefathers stood in their
	way and they felt ashamed of this. So, in order to pacify their
	consciences, they sought refuge in this verse and by its
	misinterpretation thought that that great Prophet had made an
	application for a post to serve under a non-Muslim under un-Islamic
	laws. Whereas the Prophet's own life taught the lesson that even a
	single Muslim could all by himself bring about the Islamic
	revolution in a whole country by his pure Islamic character, his
	Faith, intelligence and wisdom and that a true Believer is able to
	conquer, by the proper use of his moral character, a whole country
	without any army, ammunition or material provisions.

	During the first seven years of his reign, there was abundance of

	of the wise steps Prophet Joseph had taken as a safeguard. That was

	circumstances to go to Egypt and present themselves before him. It
	appears that Prophet Joseph had so arranged things that no foreigner

	purchase of corn, everyone was permitted to buy only a fixed

	for their father that he was old and blind but he would have

	Allah willed it, He would not have removed the flaw in the plan of
	Prophet Joseph. It was this: he could seize his brother according to
	his plan only by the help of the king's law, but it was not worthy
	of a Prophet of Allah to apply that un-Islamic law to his own
	personal case. For he had taken political power in his hands in
	order to establish gradually the Islamic law and not to enforce and
	keep the king's law in vogue. Had Allah willed it, He would have
	left no other course for His Prophet except to have resort to the
	un-Islamic law. But He did not will it so because He did not like to
	tarnish the fair name of His Prophet. Therefore he made the servants
	inquire from the brothers (an unusual thing) about the punishment of
	a thief and they stated the Law of Prophet Abraham. Thus not only
	was the flaw removed, but also no room was left for the brothers to
	raise any objection against this on the plea that they were not
	Egyptians, and therefore the law of the land could not be applied
	against them. As has already been pointed out, this was the support
	of Allah to which He has referred in the two subsequent verses as a
	token of His favor and a sign of the perfection of His knowledge. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The favor
	of Allah was that He saved Prophet Joseph from applying the
	un-Islamic law of the king of Egypt to his personal case, for he was
	liable to do so under the stress of human weakness. And there can be
	no greater favor for one than this that Allah Himself should arrange
	to guard his high moral position. It should, however, be noted that
	such a high rank is awarded only to those who prove themselves to be
	&quot;righteous&quot; in very hard trials.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">By
	removing the flaw in his plan, Allah showed that His knowledge was
	far superior to the knowledge of those, whom (like Prophet Joseph)
	He had endowed with knowledge. <BR>In this connection, there are
	some other points worthy of consideration and we will deal with them
	briefly:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1)
	Generally the words are translated like this: &quot;Joseph could not
	seize his brother by the law of the king&quot;, or &quot;Joseph was
	not authorized to seize his brother according to the law of the
	king. &quot; In other words, it means, &quot;He could not do this,
	as there was no provision for it in the king's law.&quot; Whereas it
	means this: &quot;He ought not to have seized him by the king's law,
	as it did not behoove him to do so.&quot; This version is open to
	two objections. Firstly, this is against the Qur'anic usage which
	usually means, &quot;It did not behoove him&quot;, &quot;It was not
	right for him&quot; and &quot;He ought not to have done this.&quot;
	For instance, this is what it means in the following verses</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Indeed,
	Islam alone is the Right Way in the sight of Allah.&quot; (III: 18).
	&quot;Whosoever will adopt any other way than the way of Islam, it
	shall not be accepted....&quot; (III:85).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	such a version is meaningless, for there could have been no reason
	why he had not the power to seize him for theft according to the law
	of the king. Can there be any kingdom without having a law for
	taking action against a thief? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) As
	the Qur'an uses the word which connotes &quot;the king's way of
	life&quot; in addition to &quot;the king's law&quot;, it helps to
	understand the meaning of the sentence under discussion. For it is
	obvious that the Prophet was sent to establish the way of Allah and
	not the un-Islamic way of the king. Though by that time he had only
	partially succeeded in this Mission, it was not proper and worthy of
	a Prophet to adopt &quot;the way of the king&quot; for his own
	personal case. Though there was no legal hindrance in his way to
	seize his brother according to the king's law, nevertheless, it was
	inappropriate for him, as a Prophet, to adopt the king's way which
	he had hitherto scrupulously avoided as far as his own person was
	concerned. Thus it is clear that its appropriate interpretation will
	be this: &quot;It did not behoove Joseph to seize his brother by the
	king's law.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
	Besides this, by using the word for the &quot;law of the land&quot;,
	Allah has denoted the vast comprehension of the word (din) and this
	cuts at the root of the conception of din of those people who
	confine the scope of the Message of the Prophets to mere worship of
	One Allah and believe that it has nothing to do with the cultural,
	political, social, judicial, legal and other mundane affairs of
	life. Or, they opine that, if at all it has any concern with those
	matters, it is merely to give some instructions of an optional
	nature in regard to these, and leave it to the believers to adopt
	these or their own man-made laws, because, they think, there is no
	harm even in adopting the latter course. This erroneous conception
	of din, which has been in vogue among the Muslims for a long time,
	has been responsible for rendering them neglectful of making
	exertions for the establishment of the Islamic Way of life. As a
	result of this misconception of din, they became reconciled to
	un-Islamic ways of unbelief and ignorance. Nay, they considered this
	misconception of theirs to be the pattern set by Prophet Joseph and
	became willing helpers and servants of these un-Islamic systems.
	Whereas this verse categorically refutes this misconception by
	declaring that the &quot;law of the land&quot; is as much a part of
	the din of Allah as Salat, Haj, Fast, and Zakat are. Therefore, the
	demand of the acceptance of (ad-Din) made in v. 19 and v. 85 of
	Al-i'Imran, that is, &quot;Indeed, Islam alone is the Right Way, in
	the sight of Allah&quot; and &quot;Whosoever will adopt any other
	way than the' Way of Islam, it shall not be accepted&quot;, includes
	laws as well as Salat and other obligatory duties prescribed by
	Allah. Therefore the exclusion of this part of din from any system
	would incur the displeasure of Allah.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	above interpretation, however, is open to one objection. It does, at
	least, imply that an un-Islamic way was in vogue in Egypt at the
	time, when Prophet Joseph was, even according to the present
	commentator, the supreme head of the country. It is, therefore, a
	proof that that Prophet himself was enforcing the un-Islamic law of
	the king. What difference, then, could it have made, if Prophet
	Joseph had followed, in his personal case too, the system of law of
	the king which he himself was enforcing instead of the system of law
	of Prophet Abraham? Most certainly this would have made a vast
	difference because it would have compromised his position as a
	Prophet, because he was trying to establish the Islamic Way of life,
	which naturally could have been accomplished gradually in course of
	time, during which the king's law would have inevitably remained in
	vogue. The same thing happened in Arabia during the Mission of the
	Holy Prophet in Madinah, which took nine years to establish the
	Islamic System in its entirety. During that period, several
	un-Islamic laws remained in vogue. For instance, drinking, interest,
	the un-Islamic laws of inheritance and marriage and some wrong ways
	of trade, etc., had to continue for some time. Likewise the civil
	and penal codes of Islam took some time for their complete
	introduction. So there is nothing strange in this that the king's
	law continued to be in vogue during the first nine years or so of
	Prophet Joseph's reign. But the continuance of the un-Islamic law of
	the king during the period of transition is no argument to prove
	that Allah's Prophet was sent to follow the way of the king and not
	to establish the Way of Allah.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote63sym" HREF="#sdfootnote63anc">61</A>As
	regards the question why it was not worthy of Prophet Joseph to
	apply the king's law to his personal case, its best answer is again
	found in the practice of the Holy Prophet. During the interim
	period, when the laws of ignorance had not yet been replaced by
	Islamic Laws, other Muslims went on drinking wine and taking
	interest as before, but the Holy Prophet never practiced any of
	these things. Likewise some un-Islamic laws of marriage, such as
	taking in marriage of real sisters at one and the same time, were
	practiced, but the Holy Prophet never practiced any such thing. Thus
	it is clear, that there was a difference between leaving in vogue
	some un-Islamic laws during the period of the evolution of the
	Islamic Law and practicing the same. Had Prophet Joseph applied the
	king's law to his own case, it would have meant that he had lent his
	seeming sanction to that law. But it is obvious that a Prophet, who
	is sent to eliminate the ways of ignorance. cannot follow these even

	further comments, such as. Al-'Aziz had died and Prophet Joseph was
	appointed in his place, and Zuleikha was rejuvenated by a miracle
	and married to him by the king. They have not stopped at this: they
	have, somehow or other, discovered even the conversation that took
	place between Prophet Joseph and Zuleikha in the first night of
	their marriage. In fact. all this is mere fiction, for, as has
	already been pointed out, the word was the Arabic translation or

	any particular office. It was merely a title used for the high ones
	in Egypt like &quot;His Excellency&quot; or &quot;Your Excellency&quot;,

	the story of Prophet Joseph's marriage in the Bible and the Talmud.
	According to these, he was married with Asenath, the daughter of

	use of the words &quot;with whom we have found our property&quot;
	instead of the word &quot;thief&quot; is very significant. Prophet
	Joseph avoided the use of the word &quot;thief&quot; for his brother
	because he was not really a thief. This is called (touriyah), that
	is, to put a cover over a reality or &quot;to hide a reality.&quot;
	Such a practice is allowed by the Muslim Law under certain
	conditions and with certain limitations. It may be practiced not to
	gain any selfish end, but to ward off some evil or to protect and
	save an oppressed person from some oppressor, provided that no other
	course might have been left except saying something against the
	truth or of having a resort to a deceitful device. It is obvious
	that in such a case, a righteous person will not tell a blunt lie or
	resort to an open deceit. Instead, he will say something or do
	something that might not be strictly truthful or strictly right, yet
	at the same time is not a blunt lie, so that he might hide the
	reality to ward off the evil. Such a practice is lawful, legally and
	morally, provided that it is not practiced to gain some personal or
	selfish ends but to ward off a greater evil with a lesser evil.
	Accordingly, Prophet Joseph scrupulously fulfilled all the
	conditions in this case. He placed the cup in the pack of his
	brother with his consent, but he did not ask his servants to make a
	search of his pack and accuse him of theft. After this, when the
	servants brought the brothers before him as suspects, he quietly
	rose from his seat and began to make a search of their packs. Then
	afterwards, when the brothers requested that one of them should be
	taken instead of Benjamin, he answered them back in their own words
	that he would detain only that person in whose possession the cup
	was found and none else.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Instances
	of such a practice during his campaigns are found in the life
	history of the Holy Prophet. And this cannot be regarded as morally
	objectionable according to any moral or legal standard.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote70sym" HREF="#sdfootnote70anc">68</A>It
	is worthwhile to take notice of the total number of Prophet Jacob's
	family members that migrated to Egypt with him, for it is closely
	connected with the problem that is raised concerning the total
	number of the Israelites who emigrated from there some five hundred
	years after this. According to the Bible, the total number of the
	family members was 70, including Prophet Joseph and his two sons,
	and excluding those daughters-in-law who did not belong to the
	family of Prophet Jacob. But according to the census figures given
	in Numbers, their number was about two million when they were
	counted in the wilderness of Sinai in the second year, &quot;after
	they were come out of the land of Egypt&quot; . The problem is this:
	how is it possible that &quot;these three score and ten souls of his
	house&quot; had multiplied into two million souls during five
	hundred years or so?</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is
	obvious that no family can multiply to such a large number in five
	hundred years merely by the generative process. Thus the only other
	way in which their number could have been increased was proselytism.
	And there are sound reasons to believe that this must have been so.
	The Israelites were the descendants of Prophets. They had migrated
	to Egypt because of the power Prophet Joseph enjoyed there. And we
	have seen that he made full use of every opportunity he got for
	carrying out the work of the Mission of Prophethood. Therefore it
	may reasonably be expected that the Israelites would have done their
	very best to convert the Egyptians to their faith of Islam during
	the five centuries of their power in Egypt. As a result of this the
	Egyptian converts to Islam would not only have changed their
	religion but also their culture so as to make them look quite
	different from the other Egyptians and look like the Israelites.
	Naturally the non Muslim Egyptians would have declared them to be
	foreigners just as the Hindus treat the Indian Muslims of today. By
	and by they themselves would have accepted this position and become
	members of the Israelite nationality. Afterwards, when the Egyptian
	nationalists began to persecute the alien Israelites, the Muslim
	Egyptians were also made a target of their tyranny. So when the
	Israelites migrated from Egypt, they, too, left their country along
	with them and began to be counted among them. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The above
	mentioned explanation is confirmed by the Bible also. For instance,
	it says that when they left Egypt, &quot;the children of Israel
	journeyed from Remases to Suceoth....and a mixed multitude went up
	also with them....&quot; (Exodus 12: 37-38) and &quot;the mix
	multitude that was among them fell a lusting&quot; . (Numbers 11:
	4). Then by and by these non-Israelite converts to Islam began to be
	called &quot;the stranger&quot;. &quot;One ordinance shall be both
	for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that
	sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as
	ye are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord. One law and the
	one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojourneth
	with you. &quot; (NUMBERS 15: 15-16). &quot;And I charged your
	judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren,
	and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the
	stranger that is with him.&quot; (DEUT. 1: 16).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now it is
	not an easy thing to find out the exact term which was applied in
	the original Scriptures to the Egyptian converts to Islam, and which
	was afterwards changed into the &quot;stranger&quot; by that
	translators.

	interpretation of this verse has given rise to some serious
	misunderstandings, which are against the very fundamentals of the
	Divine Guidance. So much so that some people have gone to the
	extreme of making it lawful to prostrate before kings and saints as
	a mark of respect. Others more strict on this point have explained
	it away, saying, &quot;In the former Divine Laws, it was unlawful
	only to prostrate in worship before others than Allah, though it was
	permissible to prostrate before others if it was done without the
	intention of worship, but now in the Divine Law given to Prophet
	Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) it has been made absolutely
	unlawful&quot;.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Such
	misunderstandings as these have resulted from taking the words in
	this verse to mean &quot;to perform sajadah&quot;in the technical
	sense in which it is now used in the Islamic code, that is, &quot;lying
	flat in such a way that the hands, the knees and the forehead touch
	the ground,&quot; whereas the word (sujjadan) has been used here in
	its literal meaning of sajud &quot;to bow down&quot;. The parents
	and brothers of Prophet Joseph bowed down before him in accordance
	with the ancient custom among the people of the age, (and the custom
	is still in vogue among some people), who used to bow down before
	others to show their gratitude, or welcome them, or merely to salute
	them by placing their hand on the breast. There are many instances
	of this in the Bible. &quot;....and when he (Abraham) saw them (the
	three men) corning towards him, he ran to meet them from the tent
	door, and bowed himself towards the ground. &quot; (Please refer to
	Arabic translation: Gen. 18: 32). Further on it says that when the
	children of Heath gave a field and a cave as a burying place for
	Sarah, Prophet Abraham was so grateful to them that &quot;he stood
	up and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children
	of Heth,&quot; (Gen. 23: 7) and &quot;Abraham bowed down himself
	before the people of the land.&quot; (Gen. 23: 12). In both cases
	the words `bowed down' have been translated into (Sajada). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These and
	other like instances in the Bible are a conclusive proof of the fact
	that in this verse (100), the Qur'an has not used the word in its
	technical Islamic sense but in its literal sense. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Besides,
	those commentators arc absolutely wrong who suppose that in the
	former laws, sajadah in the present Islamic sense was allowed as a
	mark of respect laws. For instance, during the Babylonian captivity
	of the Children of Israel, king Ahasuerus promoted Haman above all
	the princes and commanded all his servants to bow and reverence him,
	but Mordecai, who was a holy and righteous man among the Jews, bowed
	not, nor did him reverence. (Esther3: 1-2). The Talmud has
	elaborated this point in a way that is worth reading: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	servants of the king said to Mordecai: &quot;Why wilt thou refuse to
	bow before Haman, transgressing thus the wishes of the king? Do we
	not bow before him?&quot; &quot;Yea are foolish,&quot; answered
	Mordecai, &quot;aye, wanting in reason. Listen to me. Shall a
	mortal, who must return to dust be glorified? Shall I bow down
	before one born of woman, whose days are short? When he is small he
	cries and weeps as a child; when he grows older sorrow and sighing
	are his portion; his days arc full of wrath and anger, and at the
	end he returns to dust. Shall I bow to one like to him? No, I
	prostrate myself before the Eternal God, who lives for ever. To Hun
	the great Creator and Ruler of the Universe, and to no other will I
	bow.&quot; (The Talmud Selections by H. Polano, p. 172).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">This
	speech which was made by a Believer from among the Israelites a

	upon him) at the happiest occasion of his life help depict the most
	graceful pattern of the virtues of a true Believer. There is the man
	from the desert, whom his own brothers had, out of jealousy,
	attempted to kill, now sitting on the throne after passing through
	many vicissitudes of life. All the members of his family have been
	forced by famine to come before him for help. The same jealous
	brothers, who had made an attempt on his life, are now standing
	before him with down-cast heads. Had there been a &quot;successful
	man of the world&quot; in his place, he would have used this
	opportunity for boasting of his greatness and bragging of his
	successes, and giving vent to his grievances and hurling malicious
	taunts at his defeated enemies. In utter contrast to this, the we
	man of God behaves in a quite different way. Instead of boasting and
	bragging of his own greatness, he is grateful to his God Who had
	shown grace to him by raising him to such a high position of power,
	and for arranging his meeting with his people after such a long
	period of separation. Instead of giving vent to his grievances
	against his brothers, making taunts at them for their ill-treatment,
	he does not make even a mention of such things but puts up a defense
	for them, saying that it was all due to Satan, who had stirred up
	strife between them: nay, he even puts it forward as a blessing in
	disguise, being one of the mysterious ways of Allah by which He had
	fulfilled His design of raising him to the throne. After saying
	these things in a few concise sentences, he at once turns to his
	Lord in gratitude for bestowing on him kingdom and wisdom, instead
	of letting him rot in the prison, and prays to Him to keep him as
	His faithful and obedient servant as long as he was alive, and to
	join him with the righteous people after his death. What a pure and
	high pattern of character!</P>

	show that the story in the Qur'an differs from that given. in the
	other two Books in several very important parts. The Qur'an contains
	additional facts in some cases and omits certain facts in other
	cases or even refutes some parts as contained in the Bible and the
	Talmud. Therefore there is absolutely no room for anyone to allege

	implied in it, we must keep in view the background of the Revelation
	of this story given in the introduction to this Surah. The Quraish
	themselves had invited the Holy Prophet to a meeting that had been
	arranged for putting him to a test which was to show whether he was
	a we Prophet or not. When he arrived there, they put him this
	question without any previous notice or intimation: why did the
	Israelites go to Egypt? In answer to this, the Holy Prophet recited
	this Surah then and there. As they themselves knew that this was an
	abrupt question and there had been no preparation for its answer
	beforehand, it was expected that they would 'believe in his
	Prophethood. But they were so obdurate that they did not believe in
	him even then. As Allah was aware of their intentions, he informed
	His Messenger beforehand, as if to say, &quot;Though you have come
	out successful in the test, to which they themselves put you, yet
	most of them are not going to believe it because they are not
	sincere in their quest for the truth. That is why they will not
	believe even now when the revelation of this Surah has proved
	conclusively that the Qur'an is not being forged by you but is being

	their denial.&quot;</P>

	to serve as a mirror for you. You demanded a proof from Our
	Messenger that he was not forging the Qur'an: had you been

	Messenger to you. On the other hand, all the Prophets-Jesus, Moses,
	Abraham and Noah (Allah's peace be upon them all)-who were raised
	for the reform of the people, were human beings who wen born and
	brought up in their own habitations&quot; . Then it addresses the
	disbelievers directly, as if to say, &quot;Now it is for you to
	judge and decide whether you should accept the Messenger or reject
	him on such flimsy grounds as these. You have traveled abroad and
	seen the end of those people who rejected the Message of their
	Prophets and followed their own lusts. You have seen, on your
	journeys, the ruined habitations of the people of 'Ad, Thamud,
	Midian, Lot, and others. Have you not observed these as object
	lessons, for these warn you that they would meet with far worse
	consequences in the Hereafter, and that conversely, those who are
	pious and God-fearing will have a very happy life?&quot;
