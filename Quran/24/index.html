<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
consensus of opinion is that it was sent down after the Campaign
against Bani al-Mustaliq and this is confirmed by vv. 11-20 that deal
with the incident of the &quot;Slander&quot;, which occurred during
that Campaign. But there is a difference of opinion as to whether
this Campaign took place in 5 A. H. before the Battle of the Trench
or in 6 A. H. after it. It is important to decide this issue in order
to determine whether this Surah was sent down earlier or Surah Al-
Ahzab(XXXIII), which is the only other Surah containing the
Commandments about the observance of purdah by women. Surah Al-Ahzab
was admittedly sent down on the occasion of the Battle of the Trench.
Now if this Battle occurred earlier, it would mean that the initial
instructions in connection with the Commandments of purdah were sent
down in Surah Al-Ahzab and they were complemented later by the
Commandments revealed in this Surah. On the other hand, if the
Campaign against Bani al-Mustaliq occurred earlier, the chronological
order of the Commandments would be reversed, and it would become
difficult to understand the legal wisdom and implications of the
Commandments of purdah. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>According
to Ibn Sa'd, the Campaign against Bani al Mustaliq took place in
Shaban 5 A. H. and the Battle of the Trench in Zil- Qa'dah the same
year. This opinion is based on some traditions from Hadarat Ayesha
about the events connected with the &quot;Slander&quot; in which she
refers to a dispute between Hadrat Sa'd bin 'Ubadah and Sa'd bin
Mu'az. Hadrat Sa'd bin Mu'az, according to authentic traditions, died
during the Campaign against Bani Quraizah, which took place
immediately after the Battle of the Trench. It is, therefore, evident
that he could not be present in 6 A. H. to take part in a dispute
about the &quot;Slander&quot;. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On
the other hand, Muhammad bin Ishaq says that the Battle of the Trench
took place in Shawwal 5 A. H. and the Campaign against Bani
al-Mustaliq in Sha'ban 6 A. H. This opinion is supported by many
authentic traditions from Hadrat Ayesha and others. According to
these traditions, (1) the Commandments about purdah had been sent
down in Surah Al-Ahzab before the incident of the &quot;Slander&quot;,
(2) the Holy Prophet had married Hadrat Zainab in Zil-Qa'dah 5 A. H.
after the Battle of the Trench, (3) Hamnah, sister of Hadrat Zainab,
had taken a leading part in spreading the &quot;Slander&quot;, just
because Hadrat Ayesha was a rival of her sister. All this evidence
supports the view of Muhammad bin Ishaq. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now
let us consider the two opinions a little more closely. The only
argument in favor of the first opinion is the mention of the presence
of Hadrat Sa'd bin Mu'az in a dispute connected with the incident of
the &quot;Slander&quot;. But this argument is weakened by some other
traditions from Hadrat Ayesha, in which she mentions Hadrat Usaid bin
Hudair instead of Hadrat Sa'd bin Mu'az in this dispute. It may,
therefore, be assumed that there has been some confusion regarding
the two names in reporting the traditions. Moreover, if we accept the
first opinion, just because of the mention of the name of Hadrat Sa'd
bin Mu'az in some traditions, we encounter other difficulties that
cannot be resolved in any way. For, in that case, we shall have to
admit that the revelation of the Commandments of purdah and the Holy
Prophet's marriage with Hadrat Zainab had taken place even earlier
than the Battle of the Trench. But we learn from the Qur'an and many
authentic traditions that both these events happened after that
Battle and the Campaign against Bani Quraizah. That is why Ibn Hazm,
Ibn Qayyim and some other eminent scholars have held the opinion of
Muhammad bin Ishaq as correct, and we also hold it to be so. Thus, we
conclude that Surah Al Ahzab was sent down earlier than Surah An-Nur,
which was revealed in the latter half of 6 A. H. several months after
Surah Al Ahzab. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now
let us review the circumstances existing at the time of the
revelation of this surah. It should be kept in mind that the incident
of the &quot;Slander&quot;, which was the occasion of its revelation,
was closely connected with the conflict between Islam and the
disbelievers. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
the victory at Badr, the Islamic movement began to gain strength day
by day; so much so that by the time of the Battle of the Trench, it
had become so strong that the united forces of the enemy numbering
about ten thousand failed to crush it and had to raise the siege of
Al Madinah after one month. It meant this, and both the parties
understood it well, that the war of aggression which the Disbelievers
had been waging for several years, had come to an end. The Holy
Prophet himself declared: &quot;After this year, the Quraish will not
be able to attack you; now you will take the offensive.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">When
the disbelievers realized that they could not defeat Islam on the
battlefield, they chose the moral front to carry on the conflict. It
cannot be said with certainty whether this Change of tactics was the
outcome of deliberate consultations, or it was the inevitable result
of the humiliating retreat in the Battle of the Trench, for which all
the available forces of the enemy had been concentrated:They knew it
well that the rise of Islam was nor due to the numerical strength of
the Muslims nor to their superior arms and ammunition nor to their
greater material resources; nay, the Muslims were fighting against
fearful odds on all these fronts. They owed their success to their
moral superiority. Their enemies realized that the pure and noble
qualities of the Holy Prophet and his followers were capturing the
hearts of the people, and were also binding them together into a
highly disciplined community. As a result of this, they were
defeating the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">mushriks</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">and the Jews both on the peace and on
the war front, because the latter lacked discipline and character. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Under
the above mentioned circumstances, the wicked designs of the
disbelievers led them to start a campaign of vilification against the
Holy Prophet and the Muslims in order to destroy the bulwark of
morale that was helping them to defeat their enemies. Therefore the
strategy was to attain the assistance of the hypocrites to spread
slanders against the Holy Prophet and his followers so that the

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">and the Jews could exploit these to
sow the seeds of discord among the Muslims and undermine their
discipline. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
first opportunity for the use of the new strategy was afforded in
Zil-Qa'dah 5 A. H. when the Holy Prophet married Hadrat Zainab
(daughter of Jahsh), who was the divorced wife of his adopted son,
Zaid bin Harithah. The Holy Prophet had arranged this marriage in
order to put an end to the custom of ignorance, which gave the same
status to the adopted son that was the right only of the son from
one's own loins. The hypocrites, however, considered it a golden
opportunity to vilify the Holy Prophet from inside the community, and
the Jews and the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">mushriks</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">exploited it from outside to ruin his
high reputation by this malicious slander. For this purpose fantastic
stories were concocted and spread to this effect: &quot;One day
Muhammad (Allah's peace be upon him) happened to see the wife of his
adopted son and fell in love with her; he maneuvered her divorce and
married her.&quot; Though this was an absurd fiction it was spread
with such skill, cunning and artfulness that it succeeded in its
purpose; so much so that some Muslim traditionalists and commentators
also have cited some parts of it in their writings, and the
orientalists have exploited these fully to vilify the Holy Prophet.
As a matter of fact, Hadrat Zainab was never a stranger to the Holy
Prophet that he should see her by chance and fall in love with her at
first sight. For she was his first cousin, being the daughter of his
real paternal aunt, Umaimah, daughter of Abdul Muttalib. He had known
her from her childhood to her youth. A year before this incident, he
himself had persuaded her to marry Hadarat Zaid in order to
demonstrate practically that the Quraish and the liberated slaves
were equal as human being. As she never reconciled herself to her
marriage with a liberated slave, they could not pull on together for
long, which inevitably led to her divorce. The above mentioned facts
were well known to all, yet the slanderers succeeded in their false
propaganda with the result that even today there are people who
exploit these things to defame Islam. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
second slander was made on the honor of Hadrat Ayesha, a wife of the
Holy Prophet, in connection with an incident which occurred while he
was returning from the Campaign against Bani al-Mustaliq. As this
attack was even severer than the first one and was the main
background of this Surah, we shall deal with it in greater detail. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Let
us say a few words about Abdullah bin Ubayy, who played the part of a
villain in this attack. He belonged to the clan of Khazraj and was
one of the most important chiefs of Al-Madinah. The people had even
intended to make him their king a little before the Holy Prophet's
migration there, but the scheme had to be dropped because of the
changed circumstances. Though he had embraced Islam, he remained at
heart a hypocrite and his hypocrisy was so manifest that he was
called the &quot;Chief of the Hypocrites&quot;. He never lost any
opportunity to slander Islam in order to take his revenge. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Now
the main theme. When in Sha'ban 6 A. H. the Holy Prophet learned that
the people of Bani al-Mustaliq were making preparations for a war
against the Muslims and were trying to muster other clans also for
this purpose, he fore- stalled and took the enemy by surprise. After
capturing the people of the clan and their belongings, the Holy
Prophet made a halt near Muraisi, a spring in their territory. One
day a dispute concerning taking water from the spring started between
a servant of Hadrat Umar and an ally of the clan of Khazraj, and
developed into a quarrel between the Muhajirs(immigrants) and the
Ansar(Muslims of Madinah), but was soon settled. This, however, did
not suit the strategy of Abdullah bin Ubayy, who also had joined the
expedition with a large number of hypocrites. So he began to incite
the Ansar, saying, &quot;You yourselves brought these people of the
quraish from Makkah and made them partners in your wealth and
property. And now they have become your rivals and want domination
over you. If even now you withdraw your support from them, they shall
be forced to leave your city.&quot; Then he swore and declared, &quot;As
soon as we reach back Al-Madinah, the respectable people will turn
out the degraded people from the city.&quot; </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
the Holy Prophet came to know of this, he ordered the people to set
off immediately and march back to Al-Madinah. The forced march
continued up to noon the next day without a halt on the way so that
the people became exhausted and had no time for idle talk. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Though
this wise judgment and quick action by the Holy Prophet averted the
undesirable consequences of the mischief, Abdullah bin Ubayy got
another opportunity for doing a far more serious and greater
mischief, i. e. by engineering a &quot;Slander&quot; against Hadrat
Ayesha, for that was a mischief which might well have involved the
young Muslim Community in a civil war, if the Holy Prophet and his
sincere and devoted followers had not shown wisdom, forbearance and
marvelous discipline in dealing with it. In order to understand the
events that led to the incident of the &quot;Slander&quot;, we cite
the story in Hadrat 'Ayesha's own words. She says : </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Whenever
the Holy Prophet went out on a journey, he decided by lots as to
which of his wives should accompany him. Accordingly, it was decided
that I should accompany him during the expedition to Bani al
Mustaliq. On the return journey, the Holy Prophet halted for the
night at a place which was the last stage on the way back to Al-
Madinah. It was still night, when they began to make preparations for
the march. So I went outside the camp to ease myself. When I returned
and came near my halting place, I noticed that my necklace had fallen
down somewhere. I went back in search for it but in the meantime the
caravan moved off and I was left behind all alone. The four carriers
of the litter had placed it on my camel without noticing that it was
empty. This happened because of my light weight due to lack of food
in those days. I wrapped myself in my sheet and lay down in the hope
that when it would be found that I had been left behind, a search
party would come back to pick me up. In the meantime I fell asleep.
In the morning, when Safwan bin Mu'attal Sulami passed that way, he
saw me and recognized me for he had seen me several times before the
Commandment about purdah had been sent down. No sooner did he see me
than he stopped his camel and cried out spontaneously : &quot;How
sad! The wife of the Holy Prophet has been left here!&quot; At this I
woke up all of a sudden and covered my face with my sheet. Without
uttering another word, he made his camel kneel by me and stood aside,
while I climbed on to the camel back. He led the camel by the
nose-string and we overtook the caravan at about noon, when it had
just halted and nobody had yet noticed that I had been left behind. I
learnt afterwards that this incident had been used to slander me and
Abdullah bin Ubayy was foremost among the slanderers.(According to
other traditions, when Hadrat Ayesha reached the camp on the camel,
led by Safwan, and it was known that she had been left behind,
Abdullah bin Ubayy cried out, 'By God, she could not have remained
chaste. Look, there comes the wife of your Prophet openly on the
camel led by the person with whom she passed the night.') </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;When
I reached Al-Madinah, I fell ill and stayed in bed for more than a
month. Though I was quite unaware of it, the news of the &quot;Slander&quot;
was spreading like a scandal in the city, and had also reached the
Holy Prophet. Anyhow, I noticed that he did not seem as concerned
about my illness he used to be. He would come but without addressing
me directly, would inquire from others how I was and leave the house.
Therefore it troubled my mind that something had gone wrong
somewhere. So I took leave of him and went to my mother's house for
better nursing. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;While
I was there, one night I went out of the city to ease myself in the
company of Mistah's mother, who was a first cousin of my mother. As
she was walking along she stumbled over something and cried out
spontaneously, 'May Mistah perish!' To this I retorted, 'What a good
mother you are that you curse your own son -- the son who took part
in the Battle of Badr.' She replied, 'My dear daughter, are you not
aware of his scandal mongering?' Then she told me everything about
the campaign of the &quot;Slander&quot;.(Besides the hypocrites, some
true Muslims also had been involved in this campaign, and among them
who took leading part in it, were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, the
famous poet of Islam, and Hamnah, daughter of Jahsh and sister of
Hadrat Zainab). Hearing this horrible story, my blood curdled, and I
immediately returned home, and passed the rest of the night in crying
over it. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;During
my absence the Holy Prophet took counsel with Ali and Usamah bin Zaid
about this matter. Usamah said good words about me to this effect:'O
Messenger of Allah, we have found nothing but good in your wife. All
that is being spread about her is a lie and calumny.' As regards Ali,
he said, 'O Messenger of Allah, there is no dearth of women; you may,
if you like, marry an other wife. If, how- ever, you would like to
investigate into the matter, you may send for her maid servant and
inquire into it through her.' Accordingly, the maid servant was sent
for and questioned. She replied, 'I declare on an oath by Allah, Who
has sent you with the Truth, that I have never seen any evil thing in
her, except that she falls asleep when I tell her to look after the
kneaded dough in my absence and a goat comes and eats it.' </FONT></FONT></FONT>

<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;On
that same day the Holy Prophet addressed the people from the pulpit,
saying:'O Muslims, who from among you will defend my honor against
the attacker of the person who has transgressed all bounds in doing
harm to me by slandering my wife. By God, I have made a thorough
inquiry and found nothing wrong with her nor with the man, whose name
has been linked with the &quot;Slander&quot;. At this Usaid bin
Hudair (or Sa'd bin Mauz) according to other traditions) stood up and
said, 'O Messenger of Allah, if that person belongs to our clan, we
will kill him by ourselves, but if he belongs to the Khazraj clan, we
will kill him if you order us to do so.' Hearing this Sa'd bin
'Ubadah, chief of the Khazraj clan, stood up and said, 'You lie you
can never kill him. You are saying this just because the person
belongs to our clan of Khazraj. Had he belonged to your clan, you
would never have said so.' Hadrat Usaid retorted, 'You are a
hypocrite: that is why you are defending a hypocrite.' At this, there

	are various legal, moral and historical aspects of this problem
	which need explanation, for if these are not clarified in detail,
	the modern man will find it difficult to understand the Divine Law
	concerning it. Accordingly, we shall discuss the various aspects of
	the problem below: </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(1)
	The common meaning of zinc which everyone knows is: &quot;Sexual
	intercourse between a man and a woman without the legal relationship
	of husband and wife existing between them.&quot; There has been
	complete unanimity of view among all the social systems from the
	earliest times to this day that this act is morally wicked,
	religiously sinful and socially evil and objectionable, and there
	has been no dissenting voice except from those stray individuals who
	have subordinated their moral sense to their lust, or who in their
	misguided notions try to be &quot;original&quot; and &quot;philosophical&quot;
	in their approach. The universal unanimity of view in this respect
	is due to the fact that man by nature abhors zinc. In fact, the
	future of human race and civilization depends on this that the
	relationship between the husband and wife should be built upon the
	basis of an enduring and everlasting bond of fidelity, which should
	not only be fully recognized in the social life but should also be
	guaranteed by the existing social structure. Without this the human
	race cannot survive. This is because the human child requires years
	of tender care and training for as survival and development and a
	woman alone cannot bear the burden without the cooperation of the
	man who became the cause of the birth of the child. Similarly human
	civilization itself is the product of the corporate life of a man
	and a woman, their setting up a home, bringing up a family, and
	establishing mutual relationships and inter-connections between
	families. If men and women were to lose sight of this essential
	fact, that is, the establishment of a home and raising a family, and
	were to meet freely just for pleasure and lust, the entire structure
	of human society would crumble. In fact, the very foundations on
	which the structure of human civilization and culture has been built
	will topple down and the whole basis of the concept of a social life
	will disappear. It is for these reasons that free mixing of men and
	women, without any recognized and stable bonds of fidelity, is
	abhorrent to human nature, and it is for this reason that in every
	age zina has been considered as a moral evil and, in religious
	terminology, a grave sin. Accordingly, the social systems in every
	age recognized and adopted the institution of marriage and also
	adopted preventive measures against adultery or fornication. The
	forms of the measures adopted in this direction have, however,
	differed under different social, cultural and religious systems.
	This difference has been the result of the realization of the
	disastrous effects of adultery (or fornication) in varying degrees:
	some societies have considered it to be more heinous than others,
	and some have conceived it clearly and some others not so clearly
	and confused it with other problems. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(2)
	Though adultery (or fornication) has always been accepted as an
	evil, opinion has differed as to whether it is legally a punishable
	offense or not, and this is where Islam differs from other religions
	and systems of law. Social systems which have been akin to human
	nature have always considered illicit intercourse between man and
	woman a serious crime and prescribed severe punishments for it. But
	with the deterioration in moral standards, this morality grew weaker
	and weaker and the attitude towards this crime became more and more
	tolerant. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	first common lapse in this connection was caused by the invidious
	distinction between fornication and adultery. The former as such was
	taken as an ordinary offense while the latter only was held as a
	punishable crime. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Zina,
	as defined under various laws, means &quot;sexual intercourse
	between a man (whether married or bachelor) and a woman, who is not
	the wife of anybody.&quot; This definition takes into account the
	position of the woman rather than of the man. If a woman is without
	a husband, the illicit intercourse with her amounts to fornication
	irrespective of the fact whether the man is married or not. The
	ancient laws of Egypt, Babylon, Assyria and India provided very
	light punishments for it, and the same were adopted by the Greeks
	and the Romans,which finally influenced the Jewish attitude.
	According to the Bible, only monetary compensation is payable for
	such an offense. The Commandment on the subject is as follows: </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;And

	virgins.&quot; (Exod. 22: 16,17) </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The

	lay with her shall give unto the damsel's father fifty shekels of
	silver (about fifty-five rupees), and she shall be his wife; because
	he hath humbled her.&quot; (Deut. 22: 28, 29). </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Under
	the Jewish law, if a priest's daughter acts immorally, she is to be

	acted immorally was to suffer strangulation. (Everyman's Talmud, pp.
	319, 320). </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>To
	judge the extent to which this conception resembles that of the
	Hindus, it will be worthwhile to compare it with the laws of Manu.
	According to him, &quot;Anybody who commits illicit intercourse with
	an unmarried girl. of his own caste with her consent does not
	deserve any punishment. If the father of the girl is willing, the
	man should compensate him and marry the girl. But if the girl
	happens to belong to a higher caste and the man belongs to a lower
	caste, the girl should be turned out from her parents' house and the
	limbs of the man should be cut off.&quot; (Adhiai 8. Ashlok 365,
	366). This punishment may be changed into burning him alive, if the
	girl happens to be a Brahman. (Ashlok 377). </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Under
	all these laws, illicit intercourse with a married woman only was
	the real and major crime. The deciding factor for treating it as a
	crime was not the illicit relationship between the man and the woman
	but the likelihood of an awkward situation under which a child might
	have to be reared up by a man (the real husband of the woman), who
	was not its father. It was therefore not the act of zinc itself but
	the danger of the mixing up of progenies and the problem of rearing
	up somebody else's child at the expense of another and a possibility
	of its inheriting his property, that was the :eat basis of treating
	it as a crime and holding both the man and the woman as criminals.
	Under the Egyptian law, the man was to receive a severe beating with
	sticks and the nose of the woman was to be cut off. Similar
	punishments existed in Babylon, Assyria and Iran. According to the
	Hindus, the woman was to be thrown to the dogs to be torn apart and
	the man was to be put on a hot iron bed with fire all around him to
	burn him alive. At first the Greek and the Roman laws gave a man the
	right to kill his wife if he found her involved in adultery. He had
	also the option to demand monetary compensation. In the first
	century B.C. Augustus Caesar enacted that half the property of the
	man should be confiscated and he should be exiled. In case of the
	woman, half her dowry should be written off and one-third of her
	assets confiscated, and she should also be sent out to a distant
	part of the country. Constantine changed this law and imposed death
	penalty both for the tnan and for the woman. In the times of Leo and
	Marcian, this punishment was changed to imprisonment for life.
	Justinian further reduced the punishment and ordered that the woman
	should be flogged with stripes and sent to a monastery and the
	husband should be given the right to take her out within two years
	if he liked, otherwise she was to remain there for ever. Under the
	Jewish law, the orders for illicit intercourse with a married woman
	are as under: </FONT></FONT>

	long before the advent of Christ, the Jewish jurists and scholars,
	the rich and the poor, had practically ceased to observe these laws.
	Though it was written in the Old Testament, and it was considered as
	a Divine Commandment, nobody was inclined to apply it practically;
	in the entire Jewish history, there is not a single instance where
	this commandment was ever enforced. When Jesus Christ embarked upon
	his prophetic mission, and invited the people to the eternal truth,
	the learned Jews, seeing that there was no way to stop the tide,
	brought a woman guilty of adultery before him and asked him to
	decide her case. (John 8: 111). Their object was to create a dilemma
	for Christ and to tempt and embarrass him. If he decided in favour
	of any punishment other than stoning, they would vilify him saying,
	&quot;Here comes a strange Prophet who has changed the Divine Law
	for the sake of worldly considerations.&quot; And if he were to give
	the verdict of stoning, this would, on the one hand, bring him in
	direct clash with the Ron Ziad law, and on the other, give them the
	opportunity to tell the people, &quot;Look! What you believe in a
	Prophet who will expose you to all the severities of the Torah? But
	Jesus turned the tables on them with one sentence, saying: &quot;He
	that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. &quot;
	This put the jurists to shame and they departed one by one in
	humiliation, and the moral degeneration of the learned in law was
	totally exposed. When the woman was left alone, Jesus admonished her
	and after her repentance let her go. Jesus did this because he was
	neither a judge of any court competent to decide the case, nor any
	evidence had been produced against her, nor was there any government
	to enforce the Divine Law. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On
	the basis of this incident and some miscellaneous sayings of Jesus
	on different occasions, the Christians formed an utterly erroneous
	conception about the crime of zina. According to them, illicit
	intercourse between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman is a sin
	but not a punishable offence. But if either of them (or both) is
	married, adultery is treated as a crime. It is so not because of the
	illicit intercourse as such but because of the vow of fidelity taken
	by each of them before the priest at the altar. Nevertheless, there
	is no punishment even for this, except that the wife has the right
	to sue her adulterous husband and claim separation for having
	violated the vow of fidelity. On the other side, the husband of the
	adulterous woman can also sue his wife for separation and can also
	claim compensation from the man who had illicit intercourse with his
	wife. This is the punishment in the Christian law for adultery. The
	irony is that even this punishment is a double-edged sword, because
	a woman, though entitled to separation from her husband by proving
	his infidelity and getting rid of him cannot remarry under the
	Christian law. Similarly the husband who sues his wife for

	Western laws of the modem times, which have also been adopted by the
	Muslims in various countries, are based on such conceptions.
	According to them, zina may be an evil, and an immoral and sinful
	thing, but it is not a crime. It becomes a crime only when illicit
	intercourse is committed without the consent of the other party. As
	for adultery by a married man, this only provides a cause for
	complaint to his wife who may, if she likes, prove it and get a
	divorce. Similarly in the case of an adulteress, her husband can
	lodge a complaint against her and also against the man with whom
	adultery was committed and can sue both of them to claim divorce
	from the woman and monetary compensation from the man. </FONT></FONT>

	The Islamic Law, in contrast to all these conceptions, holds zina as
	a punishable crime and its committal by the married person enhances
	the guilt all the more. This is not so because of the violation of
	the oath of fidelity taken by the man or the woman nor because of
	the encroachment on the conjugal rights of the other, but because
	the criminal resorted to an unlawful method when there existed a
	lawful method for satisfying his sex desires. The Islamic Law views
	zina as an act which, if allowed to be indulged in freely, will
	strike at the very roots of both human race and human civilization.
	In the interest of the preservation of the human race and the
	stability of human civilization, it is imperative that relationship
	between man and woman should be regulated only through lawful and
	reliable means. And it is not possible to restrain this relationship
	if opportunities for free mixing of the sexes are allowed to exist,
	for it cannot be expected from a man or a woman to be prepared to
	bear the onerous responsibilities of the family life if he or she
	has the opportunities for the gratification of the sex desires
	without this. For in that case it will be as meaningless as buying a
	ticket for a railway journey when people can travel without a ticket
	as well. A ticket is essential only when travelling without a ticket
	is declared to be an offense. If somebody is found traveling without
	a ticket because he cannot afford to buy it, he is a criminal though
	in a lesser degree. But if a rich man resorts to this, his guilt
	becomes all the more serious. </FONT></FONT>

	Islam dces not rely on punitive law alone for saving humanity from
	the menace of zina. It employs both reformatory and prohibitory
	measures on a large scale. It has provided legal punishment only as
	a last resort. Islam does not want that the people should go on
	committing this crime and getting flogged with stripes day and
	night. Its real aim is that the people should not commit this crime
	at all and there should be no occasion to resort to the extreme
	punishment. For this purpose Islam first of all purifies man: it
	imbues him with the fear of All-Powerful and All-Knowing Allah: it
	inculcates in him the sense of accountability for his actions in the
	Hereafter from which even death cannot release him. It fills him
	with obligation of obedience to Divine Law which is sure to follow
	true Faith. Then, it repeatedly warns him that zina and unchastity
	are heinous crimes, which Allah will call to account with a severe
	reckoning. This theme occurs again and again in the Qur'an.
	Moreover, Islam provides all possible facilities for a man to marry.
	if he is not satisfied with one wife, he is allowed to take up to
	four. If the husband and the wife cannot pull on amicably, there are
	provisions for separation. In case of a dispute between the two,
	provision exists for reconciliation through the intervention of the
	members of the family and failing that through the judicial courts
	so that they should either reconcile or separate and then remarry
	wherever they like. All this has been explained in Surahs AIBaqarah,
	An-Nisa and At-Talaq. In this Surah too, it is not considered good
	and right to remain unmarried and a clear Commandment has been given
	that marriages should be arranged between unmarried persons and even
	slaves (men and women) should not be allowed to remain unmarried.
	Then Islam puts an end to all those factors which allure a man to
	zina or provide occasions for it. A year before the punishment for
	zina was prescribed, women were commanded (in Surah Al-Ahzab) to
	cover themselves with sheets and lower their head-covers over their
	faces when going out of their houses. The wives of the Holy Prophet
	(Allah's peace be upon him), who were a model for every Muslim
	family, were ordered to restrict themselves to their houses with
	decorum and dignity and not to display their charms and adornments.
	Moreover, they were required to communicate with men from behind the
	curtain if there be any need for that. This was a model which was
	followed by all the believing women who considered the Prophet's
	wives and daughters patterns of virtue and not the immodest women of
	the age of 'ignorance'. Similarly, the free mixing of the men and
	women was discouraged before it was declared as a criminal offense
	and women were prohibited from going out openly in make-up. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>After
	adopting such measures zina was declared to be a punishable offense
	and spreading of indecency in any way was also prohibited.
	Prostitution was legally banned and severe punishment was prescribed
	for charging men and women with adultery and propagating it without
	proof. Men were enjoined to restrain their gaze so that unrestricted
	feasting of eyes should not lead to lust for beauty and further on
	to illicit love. At the same time women were also enjoined to
	differentiate between mahram and non-mahram relatives.' This enables
	one to understand the entire scheme of reform, a constituent part of
	which is the prescribed punishment for zina. This extreme punishment
	is for those incorrigible persons who persist in resorting to the
	illegal course for the gratification of their sex desires in spite
	of all the treasures adopted to reform the individual and society.

	Zina was declared a culpable act in the third year of Hijrah, but,
	it was not a &quot;legal&quot; crime at that time; as such the
	police and the courts were not competent to initiate legal
	proceedings. It was considered as a social crime against the
	institution of family. Accordingly the members of the family
	themselves were competent to punish the accused. The Commandment at
	that time was that if four men should bear witness to having seen a
	man and a woman committing zina, both the culprits should get a
	beating and the woman should be imprisoned in the house. But at the
	same time there was a suggestion that this Commandment would apply
	till further orders and that the real law was yet to follow. (See
	1V: 15). After about two to three years the present Commandment was
	revealed which canceled the previous Commandment and declared zina

	15 held out a hope that Allah would open some other way out for
	those adulterous women who were to be imprisoned according to the
	Commandment contained in it. Thus, the Commandment in verse 2 of
	this Surah is the same which was promised in IV: 15. Then in IV: 25
	the punishment for a married slave-girl guilty of adultery has been
	prescribed. The word muhsanat has been used twice in the same verse
	in the same context and one will have to concede that it has been
	used in the same sense at both the places. Now let us consider the
	sentence: &quot;Whoso cannot afford to marry free Muslim women
	(muhsanat).... &quot; Obviously a muhsanah cannot mean a married
	woman; it can only mean an unmarried woman of a free family. Then at
	the end of the verse it has been enjoined that if a slave woman
	commits adultery after her marriage, she should be given half the
	punishment prescribed for a free unmarried woman. The context
	clearly indicates that in this sentence the word muhsanat has the
	same meaning as in the first sentence, i.e. an unmarried woman, who
	enjoys the protection of a free family. Thus it is concluded from
	these two verses of An-Nisa that the Commandment contained in this
	verse of An-Nur is the same that was promised in v. 15 of An-Nisa
	and it prescribes punishment for sexual intercourse between
	unmarried persons. (Also see E. N. 46 of An-Nisa). </FONT></FONT>

	As regards the punishment for adultery after marriage, the Qur'an
	does not mention it, but it has been prescribed in the Traditions.
	We learn from many authentic Traditions that not only did the Holy
	Prophet prescribe the punishment of stoning to death for it verbally
	but also enforced it practically in several cases. Then after him
	his successors not only enforced this punishment during their
	caliphates but also declared repeatedly that this was the legal
	punishment. The Companions and their followers were unanimous on
	this point and there is not a single saying of anyone to suggest
	that anybody doubted the authenticity of this law during that
	period. After them the jurists of all ages and countries have been
	unanimous that this is the legal punishment prescribed by the
	Sunnah, for there have been so many strong and continuous proofs of
	its authenticity that no scholar can refute them. In the entire
	history of the Muslims nobody ever denied this except the Kharijites
	and some Mu'tazilites and even they did not deny it on the ground
	that there was some weakness in the proof of its having been
	enjoined by the Holy Prophet, but because they considered it to be
	&quot;against the Qur'an&quot;. This was, however, due to their lack
	of understanding the Qur'an. They argued that by using the words AZ
	zani waz-zaniyatu in their general sense the Qur'an has prescribed a
	punishment of one hundred stripes for this crime. Therefore,
	according to them, the only punishment for adultery (or fornication)
	prescribed in the Qur'an was this, and to prescribe a different
	punishment for the married persons who committed adultery would be
	against the Divine Law. But they forgot that the explanation of the
	Qur'anic verses by the Holy Prophet carries the same weight and
	authority in law as the words of the Qur'an itself, provided that
	the explanation is proved to be from the Holy Prophet. The Qur'an
	has used As-sariqu was-sariqatu in similar general terms and
	prescribed the punishment of amputation of hands for the thief, both
	male and female. Now if this Commandment were to be interpreted
	literally without the limitations authentically emanating from the
	Holy Prophet, the generality of the words used would demand that
	every man or woman, who steals a needle or a plum, should be
	declared to be a thief and his or her hand cut off from the
	shoulder. On the other hand, if a thief, who has stolen a million
	rupees, declares on his arrest that he has reformed himself and has
	repented of theft, he should be let off in accordance with: &quot;But
	whoso repents after his iniquity and reforms himself, Allah will
	surely turn towards him with His favour.&quot; (IV: 39). </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Likewise
	the Qur'an forbids marriage only with a foster mother and a foster
	sister. According to their argument, such a ban should not apply to
	a foster daughter. The Qur'an forbids a person to keep two sisters
	as wives at one and the same time; therefore if a person keeps the
	aunt (paternal or maternal) and her niece together as wives, he
	should not be charged with violating the Qur'anic injunction. Again,
	the Qur'an forbids marriage with a step-daughter only when she has
	been brought up ' in the house of her step-father; therefore,
	according to their way of reasoning, the absolute prohibition of
	marriage with a step-daughter should be regarded as against the
	Qur'an. Similarly the Qur'an allows mortgage only when a man is on a
	journey and nobody is available to prepare the loan documents;
	therefore if a person is at home and a scribe is also available,
	mortgage should be regarded as un-Qur'anic. Then, the Qur'an enjoins
	in general terms: &quot;You should have witnesses whenever you buy
	or sell goods.&quot; Therefore, according to them, all sales and
	purchases taking place in the markets without witnesses should be
	unlawful. </FONT></FONT>

	the legal system of Islam. It is he alone who can explain the
	underlying intention of a Divine Command, its procedures and in what
	cases it will be applicable and in what there is another injunction.
	To deny this position and authority of the Prophet is not only

	There is a difference of opinion among the jurists about the legal
	definition of .zina. According to the Hanafis, it means frontal
	sexual intercourse of a man with a woman who is neither his wife nor
	his bondwoman, nor is there any valid reason to believe that the
	sexual act was committed under the misapprehension that the woman
	was his own wife or his own Bondwoman According to this definition,
	sexual act with a woman in the rectum, or sodomy, or sex
	gratification with animals, does not constitute zina. It is confined
	only to the frontal sexual intercourse with a woman without any
	legal right or any doubt thereof. According to the Shafi`is, zina
	means insertion of the male sexual organ into the female sexual
	part, which though forbidden by law may be quite natural: According
	to the Malikis, zina means the entry of the male sexual organ into
	the frontal sexual part, or in the rectum of a woman or man, without
	legal right or any doubt about its being legal. According to these
	two definitions, sodomy also will be included in zina. The correct
	position, however, is that these definitions are removed from the
	common meaning of zina. The Qur'an always employs words in their
	ordinary meaning and according to their common usage, unless it uses
	a certain word as a term. In such a case the Qur'an itself makes
	plain the particular sense of the term. In the context in which the
	word zina occurs, there is no indication that it has been used in
	any particular sense. Accordingly the word will have to be taken in
	the sense in which it is commonly understood. It is, therefore,
	confined to an illicit intercourse with a woman in the natural way
	and does not extend to other forms of sexual gratification. Besides,
	it is well known that there was a difference of opinion about the
	punishment for sodomy among the Companions of the Holy Prophet. Had
	sodomy been included in zina according to the Islamic terminology,
	there would have been no occasion for such a difference of opinion. </FONT></FONT>

	Penetration of the glans of the penis is a sufficient legal ground
	for punishing the act of Zina. It is not essential that the
	penetration should be full or the sexual intercourse should be
	complete. On the other hand, if there is no penetration of the glans
	of the penis, mere lying of the couple in the same bed or their
	caressing each other or their being found naked, is not a sufficient
	ground for declaring them to be guilty of Zina; so much so that the
	Islamic Law does not bother to get the couple medically examined to
	establish their guilt of illicit sexual intercourse and then to get
	them punished according to the law. Those who are found in such an
	indecent condition are offenders and punishable according to the
	circumstances. The competent authority to determine the nature of
	the punishment is either a court or the legislature of the Islamic
	State. If the punishment is to be given in the form of flogging with
	stripes, it should not exceed ten stripes as specified in a
	Tradition: &quot;Except in cases where a specific punishment has
	been prescribed by Allah, none should be flogged with more than ten
	stripes for any offense.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud).
	However, if a person is not caught red-handed but confesses his
	guilt himself, he should only be admonished to repent. According to
	a Tradition reported by `Abdullah bin Mas'ud, a man came to the Holy
	Prophet and said, &quot;I did everything with a woman except the
	sexual intercourse, outside the city. Now you may give me any
	punishment you may deem fit.&quot; Hadrat `Umar said, &quot;When
	Allah had concealed it, you also should have kept it concealed.&quot;
	The Holy Prophet, however, remained silent and the man went away.
	Then the Holy Prophet called him back and recited 'the following

	The mere fact that a person (man or woman) has committed zina, is
	not enough to declare him guilty of it. For this there are certain
	conditions which must be satisfied. These conditions are different
	for fornication and for adultery. In the case of fornication, the
	offender should be of age and possessing normal common sense. If a
	child or a lunatic is guilty of it he does not incur the punishment
	prescribed for zina. In the case of adultery, there are some
	additional conditions which are as under: </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(a)
	There is unanimity of opinion that the offender must be a free
	person and not a slave. The Qur'an itself has indicated that a slave
	shall not be stoned to death on the charge of zina. As has already
	been stated, a slave-girl, if found guilty of adultery after
	marriage, shall get half the punishment prescribed for -a free
	unmarried woman. The jurists are agreed that the same Qur'anic Law
	will apply to a slave. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(b)
	The criminal must be a legally married person. This condition has
	also the unanimous support of all the jurists. According to this
	condition, a man who has had sexual intercourse with a stave-girl,
	or whose marriage was performed in an illegal manner, will not be
	treated as married and shall not be stoned to death but will be
	flogged with stripes if he commits zina. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(c)
	Such a person should not only have been legally married but must
	have had.sexual intercourse with his wife after marriage. The mere
	ceremony of marriage does not entitle a man or a woman to be
	regarded as a muhsin or a muhsanah and be stoned to death in case of
	zina. Most of the jurists are agreed on this condition. However,
	Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Muhammad have added a supplementary
	condition to the effect that a man or a woman will be treated as
	married only when he or she is a free person and is of age and
	possesses normal common sense at the time of marriage and sexual
	intercourse. According to this supplementary condition, if a man is
	married to a slave-girl, or to a minor or mad girl, and even has had
	sexual intercourse with her, he will not be punishable by stoning to
	death if found guilty of zina. The same applies to the case of a
	woman who may have had intercourse with a slave or a mad or immature
	husband. She will not be stoned to death if found guilty of zina.
	This is a very reasonable addition by these two far-sighted
	scholars. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(d)
	The criminal should be a Muslim. But Imam Shafi`i, Imam Abu Yusuf
	and Imam Ahmad have disputed this. According to them, even if a
	non-Muslim married person, who is a protege of the Islamic State, is
	found guilty of zina, he will be stoned to death. But Imam Abu
	Hanifah and Imam Malik have concurred that the punishment of stoning
	to death for adultery after marriage, applies only to the Muslims.
	The most weighty argument advanced in this connection is that a man,
	who is to be given the extreme punishment of stoning to death,
	should be the one who, in spite of enjoying the complete state of
	ihsan dces not refrain from committing adultery. The Arabic word
	ihsan means &quot;moral fortification,&quot; which has three
	essential components. First, the man should be a believer in Allah
	and in the accountability after death and should owe allegiance to
	Divine Law. Second, he should be a free member of society and not a
	slave of somebody, which might hinder him from satisfying his
	desires in a lawful manner, and his helplessness and indigence
	should make him commit a sin when there is no family to help him in
	protecting his morality and honour. Third, he should be married and
	should have the means of statisfying his sex desires lawfully. Where
	these three components exist, the moral fortification would be
	complete and anybody who breaks through these three fortifications
	for the sake of illicit sex gratification, would really deserve the
	extreme penalty of being stoned to death. But in a case where the
	very first and foremost component of belief in Allah, in the
	Hereafter and in Divine Law, dces not exist, the fortification is
	not complete, and accordingly, the gravity of the guilt is not such
	as to entail the extreme punishment. This is supported by a
	Tradition related by Ibn `Umar and cited by Ishaq bin Rahaviah in
	his Musnad and Daraqutni in his Sunan: &quot;Whoever is guilty of
	shirk, he is not muhsan (morally fortified)&quot;. There is,
	however, a difference of opinion whether Ibn `Umar has quoted this
	as a saying of the Holy Prophet or as his own verdict. In spite of
	this lacuna, the principle is very strong and sound in its theme. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>It
	will not be correct to counteract the above argument by a deduction
	from the case brought by the Jews to the Holy Prophet in which he
	ordered the stoning of a person guilty of zina. This is because all
	the authentic reports about the case show that it was not the
	Islamic Law of the land which was applied, but the punishment was
	awarded on the basis of the Jewish personal law itself. According to
	a Tradition cited by both Bukhari and Muslim, when this case was
	brought before the Holy Prophet, he asked: &quot;What is the
	punishment for this offence in your Torah?&quot; When it was
	confirmed that the Torah prescribed stoning, the Holy Prophet said:
	&quot;I pass the same judgment as has been prescribed in the Torah.&quot;
	According to another Tradition, at the time of the judgment the Holy
	Prophet remarked: &quot;O Allah, I am the first man to revive Thy
	Commandment which they (the Jews) had rendered null and void.&quot;
	(Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Ahmad). </FONT></FONT>

	In order to hold a person guilty of Zina as punishable, it is
	necessary to prove that he committed the act of his own free will .
	If a person is forced to commit the act under compulsion or
	pressure, he or she is neither an offender nor liable to any
	punishment. This is not only based on the general principle of the
	Shari`ah that a person cannot be held responsible for acts done
	under compulsion, but this is also in accordance with the Qur'anic
	Law. In the subsequent verses of this Surah the Qur'an proclaims
	pardon for those women who are forced into prostitution. It has also
	been made clear in the various Traditions that in a case of rape
	only the man was punished and the woman, who had been violated, was
	let off. According to a Tradition cited by Tirmizi and Abu Da'ud, a
	woman went out in darkness for prayers when on the way she was
	overpowered by a man and raped. She raised a hue and cry and the
	adulterer was caught red-handed and stoned to death by the order of
	the Holy Prophet, but the woman was let off.According to a Tradition
	in Bukhari, a man raped a girl, during the Caliphate of Hadrat
	'Umar, who had the man flogged with stripes and let the girl off. It
	is clear from these instances that there is unanimity of opinion
	about the law in regard to the case of a woman raped or forced into
	prostitution. However, there is a difference of opinion in respect
	of the man who commits the act under compulsion and coercion. Imam
	Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad, Imam Shafi`i and Imam Hasan bin Salih
	express the opinion that the man too, who is forced to commit zina
	under pressure, will be pardoned. Imam Zufar is of the opinion that
	he will not be let off because the act of zina could not have been
	performed unless the male organ was fully excited, which means that
	his own lust and sex desire had urged him to commit the act. Imam
	Abu Hanifah says that if the act is done under coercion, of the
	government or any of its officials, the man will not be punished
	because when the government itself compels a man to commit it, it
	has no right to punish him. But if somebody else compels him to it,
	the adulterer will be punished because he could not have committed
	this without his own desire for it, as sexual lust cannot be aroused
	by coercion. Of the three opinions, the first one is convincing.
	This is because even if erection of the male organ is a proof of the
	sexual urge of the man, it is not necessarily a proof of his willing
	participation- in the act. Suppose, for example, that a tyrant
	imprisons a simple God-fearing man and puts a beautiful young woman
	stripped naked in the same cell and does not want to release him
	until he commits zina and the tyrant brings four witnesses to prove
	it in the court, it will not be justice to stone them to death or
	flog them with stripes in utter disregard of the circumstances. This
	is because there is a probability that circumstances may be created
	whereby sexual desire tray overpower a man even though he may not be
	a willing partner. Supposing a man were imprisoned and not given
	anything to drink except wine; then if he drinks it, will he be
	punished simply because not a single drop of wine could have gone
	down his throat if he did not intend it, even though he was forced
	by the circumstances to drink it? For in order to establish a guilt,
	mere existence of intention is not enough, but it is also necessary
	to see that the person was in a position to exercise his free will.
	Therefore, if a person is placed in such circumstances that he is
	compelled to commit a crime, he will not be a real culprit in some
	cases, and in some his offence will be very light. </FONT></FONT>

	The Islamic Law does not confer on anybody the authority except the
	government to sit in judgment against the man or the woman accused
	of 'zina and none except an Islamic court has the authority to
	punish them. There is a complete consensus of all the jurists that
	in verse 2 the Commandment, &quot;flog them with stripes&quot;, is
	not addressed to the common people but to the officials and judges
	of an Islamic government. There is, however, a difference of opinion
	whether the owner of a slave is competent to punish him or not.
	According to the Hanafi scholars, he is not, but according to the
	Shafi is he is. The Malikis hold that the owner has no right to cut
	the hand in case of theft, but in case of zina, calumny and drinking
	of wine, he can enforce the prescribed punishments. </FONT></FONT>

	Under the Islamic Law the punishment for Zina is a part of the law
	of the land. Accordingly it will apply to all people in the Islamic
	State whether they are Muslims or non-Muslims. Probably none of the
	jurists except Imam Malik has differed with this opinion. As regards
	the opinion of Imam Abu Hanifah that a non-Muslim guilty of zina
	should not be stoned to death, it is not based on the reason that a
	non-Muslim is not a complete muhsin, which is one of the conditions
	of stoning for Zina, for this condition is not satisfied unless one
	is a Muslim. On the other hand, Imam Malik says that a non-Muslim
	should not be stoned to death because the Commandment is a part of
	the Muslim personal law and the addressees are the Muslims and not
	the non-Muslims. As for the foreigner who has entered an Islamic
	State with due permission and is found guilty of Zina, he should
	also be stoned according to Imam Shafi`i and Imam Abu Yusuf, but
	according to Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Muhammad he cannot be given
	the prescribed punishment. </FONT></FONT>

	The Islamic Law does not make it obligatory that a person must
	confess his guilt of zina, or those who have knowledge of it must
	inform the authorities about it. But in case his guilt comes to the
	notice of the authorities, there is then no room for pardoning the
	guilt. This is based on a Tradition of the Holy Prophet: &quot;If
	any of you is guilty of any immorality, he should better remain
	hidden under the curtain of Allah, but if he discloses it to us, we
	shall certainly enforce the Law of Allah on him.&quot; According to
	a Tradition of Abu Da'ud, when Ma'iz bin Malik Aslami; committed the
	crime of zina, he, on the advice of Hazzal bin Nu`aim, went before
	the Holy Prophet and confessed his guilt. The Holy Prophet ordered
	that he should be stoned to death, but at the same time he said to
	Hazzal: &quot;Would that you had kept the matter hidden: this would
	have been better for you.&quot; In another Tradition cited in Abu
	Da'ud and ' Nasa'i, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Yeti should
	yourselves pardon the crimes which merit prescribed punishments
	because when a crime which calls for such a punishment comes to my
	notice, it will become obligatory on me to award the punishment.&quot;

	Under the Islamic Law Zina is not a compoundable crime. This is
	based on a Tradition which has been cited in almost all the
	collection of Hadith. A boy who was working as a labourer in a
	certain house committed Zina with the wife of his employer. The
	father of the boy gave 100 goats and one slave-girl to the tnan and
	made a compromise with him. But when the case came before the Holy
	Prophet, he said: &quot;The goats and the slave-girl are yours and
	they are returned to you.&quot; Then he awarded the prescribed
	punishment to both the guilty ones. This shows that the crime of
	zina is not compoundable and that under the Islamic Law, an outraged
	chastity cannot be compensated in terms of money. This shameless
	conception of monetary compensation for outraged modesty is a part
	of Western laws only. </FONT></FONT>

	The Islamic government shall not take action against anybody for
	zina unless it is fully proved. If the guilt is not proved, the
	authorities cannot pass orders for punishment even if they have the
	knowledge of the crime through many other sources. There was a woman
	in AI-Madinah who openly practised prostitution according to
	Traditions cited in Bukhari and Ibn Majah, but in spite of this no
	punishment was given to her as there was no proof of zina against
	her; so much so that the Holy Prophet once uttered the following
	words about her: </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;lf

	The Qur'an explicitly ordains that there should at least be four
	eyewitnesses to prove the guilt. This has been stated in An-Nisa
	(IV): 15, and in this Surah An-Nur too, it has been reiterated twice
	(vv. 4, 13). A judge is not authorized to decide the case on the
	basis of his own knowledge even if he has seen with his own eyes the
	couple committing the crime. </FONT></FONT>

	The witnesses should be reliable according to the Islamic Law of
	Evidence, which requires that they should not have been proved to be
	false witnesses on any previous occasion: they should not be
	dishonest, they should not be previous convicts, and there should be
	no proof of their having any personal grudge against the accused,
	etc. In short, no one can be stoned nor flogged with stripes on the

	There is a difference of opinion as to whether pregnancy by itself
	in a free woman, when she has no known husband, or in a slave-girl,
	when she has no known master, is a sufficient circumstantial
	evidence for the establishment of the crime of Zina. According to
	Hadrat 'Umar; this is a sufficient evidence, and the Malikis have
	adopted it. But the majority of the jurists are of the opinion that
	mere pregnancy is not a sufficient ground for stoning or flogging
	anybody with a hundred stripes. It is imperative that such a serious
	punishment should be based either on the evidence or on the
	confession of guilt. One of the basic principles of the Islamic Law
	is that the benefit of doubt should go to the accused. This is
	supported by a Tradition of the Holy Prophet: &quot;Avoid
	punishments wherever you find scope for it. &quot; (Ibn Majah). In
	another Tradition, he said: &quot;Try to avoid punishing the Muslims
	wherever possible and if there is a way for an accused to escape
	punishment, let him off. An error of judgment in letting off an
	accused is better than in punishing him.&quot; (Tirmizi) According
	to this principle, the existence of pregnancy is not a definite
	proof of zina, however strong it may be for doubt. For there is a
	possibility that in one out of a million cases the semen of a man
	may enter the womb of a woman somehow or other without any sexual
	intercourse and make her pregnant. Even such a slight possibility of
	doubt should be enough to spare the accused of the horrible
	punishment for zina. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>(19)
	There is also a difference of opinion as to whether the witnesses
	will be punished for falsely accusing a person in,case their
	evidence differs from one another, or if they are not able to prove
	the guilt. According to a section of the jurists they will be
	regarded as gazif (one who makes a false accusation as a slanderer),
	and will be punished with 80 stripes each. Others say that they
	should not be punished because they came as witnesses and not as
	plaintiffs, Moreover, if the witnesses are to be punished like this,
	nobody will, come forward as a witness in cases involving zina. This
	is because in that case no one will volunteer to appear as a witness
	at the risk of punishment, for nobody can be certain that all the
	four witnesses will be unanimous in their evidence We consider this
	second opinion as more rational, for the benefit of doubt should
	also accrue to the witnesses as it does to the accused. Therefore,
	if lapse in their testimony cannot result in the extreme punishment
	to the accused, it should also not result in any punishment to the
	witnesses branding them as false witnesses, unless of course, their
	falsehood is clearly proved. In support of the first opinion, two
	strong arguments are offered: </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First,
	the Qur'an holds false accusation about zina as a punishable
	offense. But this argument is incorrect because the Qur`an makes a
	distinction between the qazif (the slanderer) and the shahid (one
	who appears in a court as an eye-witness). An eye-witness cannot be
	branded as a slanderer merely because the court did not hold his
	evidence as a sufficient proof of the crime. </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	second argument is based on the case of Mughirah bin Shu`bah, in
	which Hadrat `Umar punished Abu Bakrah and the other two
	eye-witnesses on the charge of false accusation. A critical study of
	the entire case shows that this precedent is not applicable to every
	case where the crime is not proved by proper evidence </FONT></FONT>
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	facts of the case are that Mughirah bin Sh u`bah, the Governor of
	Basrah, did not have good relations with Abu Bakrah, whose house was
	opposite to his house across the same street. One day the windows of
	the two houses were opened by a strong current of wind. When 'Abu
	Bakrah got up to close his window, he saw through the opposite
	window across the street Mughirah in a state of actual sexual
	intercourse. He asked three of his friends (Naf`i bin Kaladah, and
	Shibl bin Ma`bad) who were also sitting with him to stand up and
	witness w Mughirah was doing. The friends asked him who was the
	woman. Abu Bakrah. said that she was Umm Jamil. The next day a
	complaint to this effect was sent to Hadrat `Umar, who immediately
	suspended Mughirah and appointed Abu Musa Ash`ari as Governor of
	Basrah. Mughirah along with the witnesses was called to AI-Madinah.
	When they were asked about the case, Abu Bakrah said that they had
	seen Mughirah actually committing sexual intercourse with umm Jamil,
	but Ziad said that the woman was not clearly visible and that he
	could not say definitely whether it was Umm Jamil or not. During the
	cross examination, Mughirah proved that they could not have seen the
	woman distinctly from the place where they were standing. He also
	proved that there was a close resemblance between his wife and Umm
	Jamil. Besides this, circumstantial evidence also showed that during
	the Caliphate of Hadrat `Umar, the governor of a province could not
	have committed this crime in his official residence, especially when
	his wife was also living with him. Thus the supposition of Abu
	Bakrah and his companions that Mughirah was having sexual
	intercourse with Umm Jamil, instead of his own wife, was nothing but
	a misplaced suspicion. It was for this reason that Hadrat `Umar not
	only acquitted the accused but also punished Abu Bakrah, Naf`i and
	Shibl as slanderers. It is obvious that this isolated decision was
	based on the specific circumstances of the case and not on the
	principle that the witnesses must be' punished when they are not
	able to prove the charge by their evidence. (For details of this
	case, see Ahkam al-Qur'an, Ibn al-`Arabi, Vol. II, pp. 88, 89). </FONT></FONT>

	Besides the evidence, the other thing by which the offense of zina
	can be established, is the confession of the accused himself. This
	confession must be in clear and plain words and the guilty one must
	confess that he committed zina with a woman who was unlawful for
	him, He should also admit that the act of zina was complete in every
	respect, 'The court must satisfy itself that the guilty person is
	confessing his guilt voluntarily without any external pressure and
	that, at the time of confession, he is in his right senses. Some
	jurists hold that one confession is not enough and that the guilty
	one must make four separate confessions. This is the view of Imam
	Abu Hanifah, Imam Ahmad, Ibn Abi Laila, Ishaq bin Rahaviah and Hasan
	bin Salih. But according to Imam Malik, Imam Shafi`i, `Uthman
	al-Batti, only one confession is enough. In cases where the
	conviction is based on the confession of the guilty person himself
	without the support of any other proof, the infliction of punishment
	should be suspended if during the course of punishment the guilty
	one retracts his confession. It does not matter even if it is quite
	evident that he is retracting his confession in order to escape the
	torture of punishment. This entire law is based on the precedents
	which have been cited in the Traditions in the various cases of
	Zina. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	most important case is that of Ma`iz bin Malik Aslami, which has
	been related by a large number of reporters on the authority of many
	Companions of the Holy Prophet (Allah's peace be upon him) and
	almost all books of Traditions contain details with regard to it.
	Ma`iz was an orphan boy from the clan of Aslam who had been brought
	up by Hazzal bin Nu'aim. He committed zina with a freed slave-girl.
	Hazzal said to him, &quot;Go to the Holy Prophet and inform him of
	your sin; may be he prays for your forgiveness.&quot; Ma`iz went
	before the Holy Prophet in ,the Mosque and said, &quot;I have
	committed zina; please purify me &quot; The Holy Prophet turned his
	face away from him and said, &quot;Woe be to you, go back and pray
	to Allah for forgiveness.&quot; But the boy again appeared before
	the Holy Prophet and said the same thing and the Holy Prophet again
	turned his face away. The boy then repeated his offense for the
	third time and the Holy Prophet again turned his face away. Hadrat
	Abu Bakr warned the boy that if he confessed the crime for the
	fourth time, the Holy Prophet would get him stoned. But the boy
	persisted and repeated the same thing again. At this the Holy
	Prophet turned to him and said: &quot;You might have only kissed or
	embraced or caressed her, or you might have looked at her with lust
	(and you thought it was an act of Zina.&quot; The boy said, &quot;No.&quot;
	The Holy Prophet asked, &quot;Did you lie with her in the same bed?&quot;
	The boy replied in the affirmative. The Holy Prophet again asked:
	&quot;Did you have sexual intercourse with her? The boy again
	replied in the affirmative. The Holy Prophet then inquired in the
	most explicit Arabic expression specifically used for this act. Such
	a naked expression had never before been heard nor was ever heard
	afterwards from him. Had it not been the question of the life of an
	individual, the Holy Prophet would never have uttered such words.
	But the boy again replied in the affirmative to this explicit
	question. The Holy Prophet then asked: &quot;Did you commit the act
	in such a manner that your male organ disappeared in her female
	part'?&quot; The boy answered, &quot;Yes.&quot; Again he was asked
	whether the act was as Complete as is a piston in a cylinder and a
	rope in a well. The boy again answered in the affirmative. Again he
	was asked whether he really understood what zina meant, and the boy
	said, &quot;Yes, I have committed the same act with her
	illegitimately which a husband commits legitimately with his wife.&quot;
	The Holy Prophet asked: &quot;Are 'you married?&quot; He said,
	&quot;Yes&quot;. Again the Holy Prophet asked whether he had taken
	any wine. He said, &quot;No&quot;, and one of the Companions smelt
	his mouth and continued that he had not. After this the Holy Prophet
	inquired of his neighbors whether he was suffering from insanity.
	They replied that he had not exhibited any sign of insanity. Then
	the Holy Prophet said to Hazzal: &quot;Had you kept it secret, it
	would have been better for you.&quot; Then he ordered Ma`iz to be
	stoned to death and he was stoned to death outside the city. When
	they began to throw stones at him, Ma`iz tried to escape, and said,
	&quot;O people, take me back to the Holy Prophet. The people of my
	clan deluded me, assuring that the Holy Prophet would not condemn me
	to death. &quot; But they did not let him escape. Afterwards when
	this incident was reported to the Holy Prophet, he said: &quot;Why
	didn't you let him go? Had you brought him to me, he might have
	repented. and Allah might have accepted his repentance.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

	Ghamid, a branch of Juhainah tribe. She also confessed four times
	that she had committed zina and had become pregnant as a result
	thereof. At her first confession, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Woe
	be to you, go back and ask forgiveness of Allah and repent.&quot;
	But she said, &quot;O Messenger of Allah, do you want to put me off
	like Ma'iz? I am pregnant as a result of zina. &quot;As there
	existed pregnancy along with the confession, the Holy Prophet did
	not cross examine her in detail as he did in the case of Ma`iz. He
	said to her, &quot;Well, if you do not accept my counsel, go back
	and come to me after the birth of the child.&quot; After delivery
	had taken place, she came along with the child and said, &quot;Please
	purify me now.&quot; The Holy Prophet said: &quot;Go and suckle your
	child, and come to me after the suckling is over. &quot; She again
	came after the weaning of the child and brought a piece of bread
	with her. She fed the child with the piece of bread before the Holy
	Prophet and said, &quot;O Messenger of Allah, now the child has been

	The three cases mentioned above clearly show that a guilty person,
	who confesses his sin, will not be questioned about the other person
	with whom he or she committed zina. This is because in that case two
	persons shall have to be punished instead of one. The Islamic Law is
	not anxious to punish people. But if the guilty person names the
	other party to the crime, then that party will be interrogated and
	also punished in case of confession. But if the other party denies
	it, only the person confessing the guilt, will be punished. However,
	there is a difference of opinion among the jurists as to whether
	such a person will be punished for zina or for false accusation.
	According to Imam Malik and Imam Shafi`i, he will be awarded the
	prescribed punishment for zina , because he has confessed that crime
	alone. According to Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Auza'i, he shall be
	convicted as a false accuser, because the denial of the other party
	has made his crime of zina doubtful but his guilt of false
	accusation stands proved anyhow. According to Imam Muhammad and it
	is supported by a saying of Imam Shafi'i also, he will be punished
	for zina as well as for slander. This is because he has confessed
	the guilt of zina himself and has not been able to prove his
	accusation against the other party. A similar case was brought
	before the Holy Prophet. A Tradition to this effect cited in Musnad
	Ahmad and in Abu Da'ud by Sahl bin Sa`d contains these words: &quot;A
	person confessed before the Holy Prophet that he had committed zina
	with such and such a woman.&quot; The Holy Prophet inquired of the
	woman but she denied it. Then he gave him the prescribed punishment
	but forgave the woman. This Tradition, however, does not specify the
	punishment that was awarded. In another Tradition cited in Abu Da'ud
	and Nasa`i from Ibn `Abbas, it has been stated that on the man`s
	confession the Holy Prophet gave him the prescribed punishment for
	zina. But when the woman denied it, the man was flogged with stripes
	for making a false accusation. But this Tradition is weak as regards
	its links, because one of its reporters, Qasim bin Fayyaz, is not
	considered as reliable by many scholars of Traditions. Moreover,
	this Tradition appears to be opposed to reason because it cannot be
	expected of the Holy Prophet that he would first punish the man for
	zina and then make an inquiry from the woman. Common sense and
	justice, which the Holy Prophet could not have overlooked, demanded
	that his case should not have been decided before making an inquiry
	from the woman. This is supported by a Tradition cited by Sahl bin
	Sa'd. Therefore, the second Tradition cannot be considered as
	reliable. </FONT></FONT>

	Imam Abu Hanifah and his disciples-Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Zufar and

	(prescribed punishment) for zina in such cases is only 100 stripes
	both for the man and for the woman. Any additional punishment, such
	as exile or imprisonment, is not &quot;hadd&quot; but ta `zir
	(discretionary punishment). If the judge feels that the guilty man
	is of immoral character, or that the illicit relations of the guilty
	ones are too intimate, he may exile or imprsion them as the occasion
	may demand. The difference between hadd and to `zir is that hadd is
	a specific punishment which must be inflicted provided that the
	guilt has been proved according to the conditions laid down in the
	Shari `ah, whereas to `zir is a punishment which has not been
	specified by the Shari `ah with regard to its nature and gravity,
	but is determined by the court in accordance with the circumstances
	of the case. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>All
	the above different opinions have been based on various Traditions
	of the Holy Prophet, which are given below:</FONT></FONT></P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>According
	to a Tradition related by `Ubadah bin Samit and cited by Muslim, Abu
	Da'ud, Ibn Majah, Tirmizi and Imam Ahmad, the Holy Prophet said: ;
	Take it from me. Take it from me. Allah has prescribed the method
	for dealing with women guilty of zina. An unmarried man committing
	zina with an unmarried woman should get 100 stripes and one year's
	exile. The married man committing zina with a married woman, should
	get 100 stripes and stoning to death.&quot; Though this Tradition is
	technically correct according to its authentic links, we learn from
	a large number of correct Traditions that it was neither acted upon
	during the time of the Holy Prophet nor during the rightly-guided
	Caliphate nor 'any jurist ever gave any verdict strictly in
	accordance with it. According to a Tradition from Abu Hurairah and
	Zaid bin Khalid Juhani, which has been cited by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu
	Da`ud, Tirmizi Nasa`i, Ibn Majah and Ahmad, a case was brought by
	two Beduins before the Holy Prophet. One of them said, &quot;My son,
	who worked as a labourer in the house of this man, got involved with
	his wife. I compromised with him by giving him 100 goats and one
	slave-girl, but I have been told by the scholars that this is
	against the Book of Allah. Please decide the case between us
	according to the Book of Allah.&quot; The second man also said the
	same thing and asked for the decision according to the Divine Book.
	The Holy Prophet said: &quot;I will decide according to the Divine
	Book. You should take back your goats and the slave-girl. Your son
	shall get 100 stripes and a year's exile.&quot; Then the Holy
	Prophet said to a man from the clan of Aslam: &quot;O Unais, go to
	this man's wife and inquire from her about this. If she confesses
	her guilt, stone her to death.&quot; The woman confessed the guilt
	and was stoned to death. It should be noted that in this Tradition
	there is no mention of flogging the married woman before stoning her
	to death, whereas the unmarried man, guilty of zina with a married
	woman, was punished with flogging and exile. <BR>Besides this, the
	accounts of the cases of Ma`iz and Ghamidiyyah, which have been
	cited in the various books of Traditions, do not mention anywhere
	that the Holy Prophet ordered flogging of the guilty person before
	stoning him or her to death. <BR>There is no Tradition in any book
	of Traditions to the effect that the Holy Prophet, in any case,
	combined flogging with stoning to death. In all the cases of zina by
	married persons, he awarded the punishment of stoning to death only.
	<BR>In his well-known address, cited by Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmizi,
	and Nasa`i on the authority of various reporters, Hadrat `Umar
	declared most emphatically that the punishment for zina after
	marriage is stoning to death. Imam Ahmad also has cited various
	Traditions regarding this but in none of these there is any mention
	of flogging before stoning to death. <BR>From among the
	rightly-guided Caliphs Hadrat `Ali alone combined flogging with
	stoning to death in one case. Imam Ahmad and Bukhari have cited this
	case on the authority of `Amir Sha`bi that a woman named Shuaha
	confessed being pregnant as a result of illicit intercourse. Hadrat
	`Ali got her flogged on Thursday and stoned to death on Friday,
	saying, &quot;We flogged her according to the Book of Allah and
	stoned her to death in accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet. &quot;.
	There is no other case than this in which both the punishments were
	combined during the rightly-guided Caliphate. </FONT></FONT>

	to a Tradition cited in Abu Da'ud and Nasa`i on the authority of
	Jabir bin `Abdullah, a man committed zina and the Holy Prophet
	awarded him the punishment of flogging. Afterwards when it came to
	be known that he was a married man, he ordered that he should be
	stoned to death. Besides this, we have already cited several other
	Traditions showing that the Holy Prophet awarded the punishment of
	flogging only to the unmarried persons guilty of zina. For instance,
	the man who raped a woman while she was going out for prayers, and
	the man who confessed his crime of zina but the woman did not, were
	given the punishment of flogging. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>As
	regards &quot;exile&quot;, the authority may use its own discretion.
	Hadrat `Umar exiled Rabi`ah bin Umayyah bin Khalf on a charge of
	drinking and he fled and joined the Romans. At this Hadrat 'Umar
	said that in future he would not exile a man and a woman guilty of
	zina, because he feared that there was a risk of mischief in it.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>In
	the light of these traditions and cases as a whole, it becomes quite
	plain that the view of Imam Abu Hanifah and his disciples is
	correct: the punishment for a married man or woman for zina is
	stoning to death alone while the punishment for unmarried persons is
	100 stripes only. Flogging and stoning to death were never combined
	from the time of the Holy Prophet up to the Caliphate of Hadrat
	`Uthman. As for combining flogging and exile, it was practised on
	some occasions while on others it was not. This clearly establishes
	the correctness of the way of Imam Abu Hanifah. </FONT></FONT>

	The first reference to the nature of flogging with stripes is
	implied in the word fajlidu of the Qur'an itself. The word jald is
	derived from jild, which means &quot;skin&quot;. Accordingly all
	lexicographers and commentators have taken it to mean that flogging
	should be carried out in such a way that its effect should be
	confined to the skin only and should not reach the flesh under it.
	The flogging that causes deep wounds into the flesh or tears it up
	into pieces is against the Qur'an. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>The
	whip or the cane used for the purpose of flogging should be medium
	in all respects: it should neither be thick and hard nor thin and
	soft. According to a Tradition cited by Imam Malik in Mu'atta, the
	Holy Prophet asked for a whip for flogging but as it had worn out
	owing to long use, he said: &quot;Bring a harder one.&quot; Then a
	new whip was brought which was very hard because of lack of use. The
	Holy Prophet said: &quot;Get me one between these two.&quot;
	Accordingly a whip was brought which had been used in riding and
	with it he gave the flogging. A similar tradition has also been
	cited by Abu `Uthman an-Nahdi about Hadrat `Umar that he always used
	a medium whip. (Ahkam al-Qur'an, AI-Jassas,Vol. III, p. 322). A whip
	with knots or one having two or three prongs is also prohibited. </FONT></FONT>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Flogging
	should also be of average intensity. Hadrat `Umar used to instruct

	fully to strike with full force. (Ahkam aI-Qur'an, Ibn al-`Arabi,

	the face and the private parts, and, according to the Hanafis, the
	head also should be spared but all other parts should get some
	flogging. Hadrat `Ali once said to the flogger, &quot;Let every part
	of the body get its due share except the face and the private
	parts.&quot; According to another tradition, he said, &quot;Save the
	head and the private parts only.&quot; (Ahkam al-Qur'an, Al Jassas

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>While
	flogging, a man should be made to stand and a woman to sit. In the
	time of Imam Abu Hanifah, Qazi Ibn Abi Laila of Kufah got a woman
	flogged while she was standing. The Imam took a strong objection to
	it and openly declared it to be a wrong thing. Incidentally, this
	also throws light on Imam Abu Hanifah's stand with regard to the law
	of the contempt of court. At the time of flogging, the woman should
	be in her full dress: her clothes should rather be tied down on her
	so that no part of her body might be exposed; her thick clothes only
	will be taken off; but in regard to a man, there is some difference
	of opinion. According to some jurists, he will be allowed to remain
	in his pyjamas only, and according to some others, the shirt will
	not be taken off. Hadrat Abu `Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah sentenced a
	person guilty of zina to be flogged. The man said, &quot;This sinful
	body should get a severe flogging.&quot; Then he started taking off
	his shirt, but Abu `Ubaidah said, &quot;Do not let him take off his
	shirt.&quot; (Ahkam al-Qur`an, AlJassas, Vol. III, p. 322). During

	meet the requirements of the law. During the time of the Holy
	Prophet, an old man, who was suffering from some disease, was found
	guilty of zina and the Holy Prophet awarded him the same kind of
	punishment. (Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Nasa`i Ibn Majah). In the case of a

	also is authorized to award a punishment of 30 stripes to a prisoner
	for disobedience or insolence, and this flogging is carried out by a
	specialist who keeps himself ready and fit by regular practice and
	the canes are wetted beforehand so that they may cut through the

	nothing but a thin cloth wetted with tincture of iodine is left to
	cover his private parts. Then he is tied down to a tripod to prevent
	him from making any movement at the flogging and the flogger comes
	running from a distance and strikes him with full force. Every time
	the same part (buttocks) is struck so hard that the flesh flies out

	After a convict has been stoned to death, he (or she) will be
	treated like any other Muslim: his (or her) body will be washed and
	shrouded: funeral prayer will be said in the Islamic way, and he (or
	she) will be buried with due respect in a Muslim graveyard. Prayers
	for his forgiveness will be offered and it will be improper for
	anyone to talk ill of him. According to Jabir bin 'Abdullah Ansari,
	as cited in Bukhari, when Ma'iz bin Malik was stoned to death, the
	Holy Prophet said good words about him and himself led his funeral
	prayer. A Tradition from Buraidah, as cited in Muslim, states that
	the Holy Prophet said: &deg;Pray for the forgiveness of Ma'iz bin
	Malik: he has offered such a repentance that if it were to be
	distributed over a whole community, it would suffice for the
	forgiveness of all its people.&quot; In the same Tradition it has
	been mentioned that when Ghaimidiyyah died due to stoning, her
	funeral prayer was led by the Holy Prophet. When Khaid bin Walid
	talked ill of her, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Khalid, hold your
	tongue! I swear by Him Who controls my life that her repentance was
	such that even if a cruel tax-collector had offered such a
	repentance, he would have been forgiven.&quot; According to Abu
	Hurairah, as cited in Abu Da'ud, after the stoning of Ma`iz one day
	when the Holy Prophet was walking along, he heard two men talking
	ill of Ma`iz. When he had gone a few paces further, he saw the dead
	body of a donkey. He stopped there and asked the two men: &quot;Come
	on and eat something out of it.&quot; They said, &quot;O Prophet of
	Allah, who can eat a dead donkey?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied:
	&quot;Talking ill of your own brother was much worse than eating a
	dead donkey. &quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

	for this adulteress?&quot; The Holy Prophet said: &quot;She has
	offered such a repentance that if it were to be distributed .ever
	the whole of the population of Al-Madinah, it would suffice for
	their forgiveness.&quot; According to another Tradition from Abu
	Hurairah, cited in Bukhari; when a man was being punished for
	drinking, somebody said, &quot;May God defame him!&quot; The Holy
	Prophet said: &quot;Do not utter such words and thus help Satan
	against him.&quot; In Abu Da'ud there is an addition to this,
	according to which the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Pray like this: 'O
	Allah, pardon him and show mercy to him'.&quot; This is the true
	spirit of punishment in Islam. Islam dces not punish even the
	biggest criminal with vindictiveness but with the intention to
	reform him. That is why after the punishment, mercy and compassion
	are shown towards him. In contrast to this, the modern civilization
	adopts a very mean attitude towards those who are killed by the
	state military or police and whose death is upheld by a judicial
	inquiry. It is not tolerated that even somebody may carry his dead
	body to the graveyard or utter a good word about him. In the face of

	Salat, Fasting, Hajj and payment of Zakat dues, but the law of the
	land is also a part of the &quot;Way of Allah&quot;. The
	establishment of the &quot;Way&quot; does not mean the establishment
	of Salat alone but it also includes the establishment of the Divine
	Law and the system of law based on it. If these things are not
	established, the mere establishment of the system of Salat will be
	regarded as partial implementation of the &quot;Way&quot;. But when
	instead of this an un-Islamic system of law is adopted, it amounts
	to the total rejection of the Divine Way itself. </FONT></FONT>

	asked: ' Why did you do so?' He will say, 'It was out of pity for
	your people.' Allah will say: 'Well, it means you were more
	compassionate towards those people than Myself.' Then it will be
	ordered: `Take him to Hell.' Another judge, who had enhanced the
	punishment by one stripe will be brought forth. He will be asked:
	'Why did you do so?' He will say, `It was done to serve as a

	punishment was the result of compassion or some other factor. But if
	the quantum of punishments were to be changed according to the
	status of the culprit, it would constitute the worst type of crime.
	According to a Tradition related by Hadrat `A'ishah, the Holy
	Prophet (Allah's peace be upon him) said in an address: &quot;The
	communities before you perished because whenever anyone from among
	their aristocrats committed a theft, he was forgiven but whenever an
	ordinary man committed the same offense, he was awarded the

	the culprit may not feel its effect at all. The verse covers both
	the above interpretations and, in fact, both are plausible. It also
	means that the one guilty of fornication should get the same
	punishment which has been prescribed by Allah and no other type of
	punishment. It is a sin to inflict any other type of punishment
	instead of flogging even for the sake of compassion or pity. But` if
	any other type of punishment is inflicted on the ground that
	flogging with stripes is a barbarous type of punishment, it amounts
	to kufr ; which should never be tolerated even for a moment by a

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote5sym" HREF="#sdfootnote5anc">5</A>That
	is, only an adulterous woman is a fit match for an adulterous man
	who has not repented, or an idolatrous woman. No believing, virtuous
	woman can be a match for hull. It is forbidden for the Believers
	that they should give their daughters in marriage to such wicked
	people knowing them to be so. Similarly the tit match for adulterous
	women (who have not repented) can only be adulterous or idolatrous
	men; they are not fit for any righteous Believer. It is forbidden
	for the Believers that they should marry women who are known to
	possess immoral character. This thing applies to those men and women
	who persist in their evil ways, and not to those who repent and
	reform themselves, for after repentance and reformation they will no
	longer be regarded as &quot;adulterous.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, the prohibition of marriage with an
	adulterous man implies that such a marriage, if contracted, will
	have no legal effect. But this view is not correct. Prohibition does
	not have any legal implications. It cannot mean that if a person
	violates this prohibition, the marriage will be void, and the
	parties concerned will be involved in zina in spite of marriage. For
	the Holy Prophet has stated: &quot;The unlawful does not make the
	lawful unlawful.&quot; (Tabarani, Daraqutni). In other words, an
	illegal act does not make a legal act also illegal. Therefore, if a
	person commits zina and then marries, his conjugal relations with
	his spouse cannot be considered as zina, because in that case the
	other party of the marriage contract who is not immoral, will also
	have to be considered as involved in zina. As a rule, no illegal act
	except open rebellion can cause the one guilty of it to be declared
	an outlaw, so that no act of his can be regarded legal after that.
	If the verse is considered in this light the plain meaning would be
	this: It is a sin to select such persons for marriage as are known
	to be unmoral. The Believers should shun them, otherwise they will
	feel encouraged, whereas the Shari ah intends to segregate them as
	the undesirable and contemptible element of society. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Similarly
	this verse does not validate the marriage of an adulterous Muslim
	with an idolatrous woman and of an adulterous Muslim woman with an
	idolatrous man. The verse simply means to emphasize the act of zina,
	and declares that the person who commits it being a Muslim, makes
	himself unfit for contracting a marriage in the pure and pious
	Muslim society. He should either stripes so that he does not utter
	such a slander in future. Even if the accuser is an eye-witness of
	an immoral act, he should keep the secret and let the filth remain
	where it is instead of causing it to spread. However, if he has
	witnesses, he should abstain from publicizing the matter in society
	but should bring the case to the notice of the authorities and get
	the criminals duly punished by the court of law. Below we give the
	details of the law in serial order: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	context in which the words wallazina yarmun-al-muhsanat (those who
	charge chaste women with false accusation) occur clearly shows that
	it does not imply any common sort of accusation but specifically the
	accusation of zina against the chastity of pure women. Then the
	demand from the accusers to produce four witnesses in support of
	their accusation also shows that it relates to zina, for in the
	entire Islamic Law producing four witnesses is the legal requirement
	only in a case zina and in no other matter. The scholars are,
	therefore, agreed that this verse describes the law relating to the
	accusation of zina, which has been termed qazf for convenience so
	that this law is not extended to cover cases of other accusations
	like that of theft, drinking, taking of interest, etc. Apart from
	qazf, the question of determining punishments for other allegations
	can be left to the discretion of the judge, or to the consultative
	council of the Islamic state, who can make general laws to cover
	cases of contempt and defamation as and when required 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Though the verse only mentions al-muhsanat (pure and chaste women),
	the jurists are agreed that the law is not confined to the
	accusation in respect of women, but it extends to the accusation in
	respect of chaste men also. Likewise, though the masculine gender
	has been used for the accusers, the law is not confined to male
	accusers only but extends to female accusers as well. For as regards
	the gravity and wickedness of the crime, it does not make any
	difference whether the accuser or the accused is a man or a woman.
	Therefore in either case, the man or accuser or the woman accusing a
	virtuous and chaste man or woman of zina, will be dealt with under
	this law. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) This
	law can be applied only in a case where the accuser has accused a
	muhsan or muhsanah, i.e., &quot;a morally fortified&quot; man or
	woman. In case the accused is not &quot;morally fortified&quot;, the
	law cannot be applied. if a person who is not &quot;morally
	fortified&quot; is known for his immorality, there will be no
	question of the &quot;accusation&quot;, but if he is not, the judge
	can use his discretion to award a punishment to the accuser, or the
	consultative council can make necessary laws to deal with such
	cases. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) For
	an act of qazi to be considered as punishable, it is not enough that
	somebody has accused somebody else of immorality without a proof,
	but there are certain conditions which have to be fulfilled in
	respect of the qazif(accuser), maqzuf(the accused) and the act of
	qazf itself. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the qazif, he should satisfy the following conditions: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a) He
	should be an adult: if a minor commits the crime of qazf he can be
	given a discretionary punishment but not the prescribed punishment. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b) He
	should possess normal common sense: an insane and mentally abnormal
	person cannot be given the prescribed punishment; similarly, a
	person under the influence of an intoxicant, other than a forbidden
	intoxicant, e.g., chloroform, cannot be considered as guilty of
	qazi. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(c) He
	should have committed qazf out of his own free will or choice, and
	not under duress, 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(d) He
	should not be the father or grandfather of maqzuf(the accused), for
	they cannot be given the prescribed punishment. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to the Hanafis, the fifth condition is that the accuser should not
	be drunk, because the person who only gesticulates cannot be held
	guilty of qazi. But Imam Shafi`i disputes this. He says that if the
	gesticulation of the drunk person is clear and unambiguous by which
	everybody can understand what he wants to say, he will be considered
	as a qazif, because his gesticulation is no less harmful to defame a
	person than the word of mouth. On the contrary, the Hanafis do not
	hold mere gesticulation as a strong enough ground for awarding the
	prescribed punishment of 80 stripes; they, therefore, recommend a
	discretionary punishment for it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	conditions to be satisfied by maqzuf(the accused) are as follows: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a) He
	should be possessing normal common sense, i.e., he should be accused
	of having committed zina while in the normal state of mind; the
	accuser of an insane person (who might or might not have become sane
	later) cannot be held guilty of qazf, for the insane person cannot
	possibly safeguard his chastity fully; and even if the evidence of
	zina is established against him, he will neither become deserving of
	the prescribed punishment nor incur personal defamation; therefore,
	the one accusing him also should not be held as deserving of the
	prescribed punishment of qazf. However, Imam Malik and Imam Laith
	bin Sa`d hold that the qazif of an insane person deserves to be
	awarded the prescribed punishment of qazf, because he is accusing
	another person of zina without a proof thereof. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b) He
	should be an adult, i.e., he should be accused of having committed
	zina while being of full age legally; accusing a minor, or a grown
	up person that he committed zina when a minor, dces not deserve the
	&quot; prescribed punishment, for, like an insane person, a child
	also cannot fully safeguard his honour and chastity. However,
	according to Imam Malik, if a boy approaching the age of majority is
	accused of zina, the accuser will not deserve the prescribed
	punishment, but if a girl of that age is accused of having submitted
	herself for zina, when sexual intercourse with her is possible, her
	qazif will deserve the prescribed punishment, for the accusation
	defames not only the girl's family but ruins the girl's future as
	well. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(c) He
	should be a Muslim, i.e., he should be accused of having committed
	zina while in Islam. Accusing a non-Muslim, or a Muslim that he
	committed zina when a non-Muslim, does not entail the prescribed
	punishment. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(d) He
	should be free; accusing a slave or a slave-girl, or a free person
	that he committed zina when a slave, does not call for the
	prescribed punishment, for the helplessness and weakness of the
	slave can hinder him from safeguarding his honour and chastity. The
	Qur'an itself has considered the state of slavery as excluded from
	the state of ihsan (moral fortification). (IV: 25). But Da'ud
	Dhahiri does not concede this argument; he holds that the qazif of
	the slave or slave-girl also deserves the prescribed punishment of
	qazf. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(e) He
	should possess a pure and blameless character, i.e., he himself
	should be free from zina proper and everything resembling therewith,
	This means that he should neither have been held guilty of zina in
	the past, nor should have had sexual intercourse in an illegal
	marriage, nor with a slave girl who was not clearly in his
	possession legally, nor with a woman whom he mistook for his wife.
	His day to day life should be such that nobody could accuse him of
	immorality, nor he should have been held guilty of lesser crimes
	than zina before. In all such cases the moral purity of the person
	falls into disrepute, and the accuser of such a person cannot
	deserve the prescribed punishment of 80 stripes. So much so that if
	the guilt of zina against an accused person is proved on the basis
	of evidence just before the enforcement of the prescribed punishment
	on an accuser, the latter will be forgiven; because the former is no
	longer chaste and morally pure. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Though
	the prescribed punishment cannot be enforced in any of these five
	cases it does not, however, mean that a person who accuses an insane
	person or a minor or a non-Muslim, or a slave, or an unchaste person
	of zina without proof, does not even deserve a discretionary
	punishment. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now let
	us consider the conditions which must be found in the act of qazf
	itself An accusation will be considered as qazf, if either an
	accuser accuses a person of such a sexual act which, if proved to be
	correct by necessary evidence, would make the accused liable to the
	prescribed punishment, or the accuser holds the accused as of
	illegitimate birth. But in either case the accusation must be
	unambiguous and in clear terms; vague references in which the
	accusation of zina or illegitimacy depends upon the accuser's
	intention, are not reliable. For instance, using words like
	adulterer, sinner, wicked, immoral, etc. for a man, and prostitute,
	harlot, whore, etc. for a woman is only a reference and not qazf.
	Similarly, words which are used as an abuse like bastard, etc.
	cannot be regarded as qazf. There is, however, a difference of
	opinion among the jurists whether an allusion is also gazf or not.
	According to Imam Malik, if the allusion is clear and is meant to
	charge the addressee of zina or hold him as of illegitimate birth,
	it will be qazf, and the qazif will be liable to the prescribed
	punishment. But Imam Abu Hanifah and his companions and Imam
	Shafi`i, Sufyan Thauri, Ibn Shubrumah, and Hasan bin Saleh hold the
	view that an allusion is in any way ambiguous and doubtful, and
	wherever there is doubt, prescribed punishment cannot be awarded.
	Imam Ahmad and Ishaq bin Rahaviyah maintain that if an allusion is
	made in the heat of a quarrel or fight, it is qazf, but if in sport
	and fun, it is not. Hadrat `Umar and Hadrat `Ali, from among the
	Caliphs, awarded the prescribed punishment in cases of allusion. In
	the time of Hadrat `Umar, one of the two men, who were involved in a
	brawl, said to the other, &quot;Neither was my father an adulterer
	nor was my mother an adulteress.&quot; The case was brought before
	Hadrat `Umar. He asked those present there what they understood by
	the remark. Some said that the man had only praised his parents and
	had notb imputed anything to the other man's parents. Others
	objected to the use of the words and said that by these he had
	clearly alluded that the other man's parents were adulterous. Hadrat
	`Umar concurred with the latter and awarded the prescribed
	punishment. (Al-Jassas, vol. III, p. 330). There is also a
	difference of opinion as to whether accusing somebody of sodomy is
	qazf or not. lmam Abu Hanifah does not regard it qazf but Imam Abu
	Yusuf, Imam Muhammad; Imam Malik and Imam Shafi`i hold it as qazf
	and recommend the prescribed punishment for it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) There
	is a difference of opinion among the jurists as to whether qazf is a
	cognizable offence or not. Ibn Abi Laila says that this is the right
	of Allah; therefore, the qazif will be awarded the prescribed
	punishment whether maqzuf (the accused) demands it or not. Imam Abu
	Hanifah and his companions hold that it is certainly a right of
	Allah in so far as the enforcement of the prescribed punishment on
	the establishment of the offence is concerned, but in so far as the
	trial of the accuser under the law is concerned, it depends on the
	demand of the accused, and in this respect it is the right of man.
	The same is the opinion of Imam Shafi`i, and Imam Auza'i. According
	to Imam Malik, if the offense of gazf is committed in the presence
	of the ruler, it is a cognizable offense, otherwise legal action
	against the accuser will depend on the demand of the accused 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) Qazf
	is not a compoundable offense. If the accused does not bring the
	case to the court, it will be a different thing; but when the case
	is brought to the court, the accuser will be pressed to prove his
	accusation, and if he fails to prove it, he will be awarded the
	prescribed punishment. The court then cannot pardon him nor the
	accused himself, nor the matter can be settled by making monetary
	compensation, nor the accuser can escape punishment by offering
	repentance or apology. The Holy Prophet has instructed: &quot;Forgive
	among yourselves offenses that deserve the prescribed punishment,
	but when a case is brought before me, the punishment will become
	obligatory.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7)
	According to the Hanafis, the demand for the prescribed punishment
	of qazf call either be made by the accused, or, if the accused is
	not there, by the one whose lineage suffers the stigma, e.g., the
	father, mother, children. and the children's children. But according
	to Imam Malik and Imam Shafi`i, this right is inherited. If the
	accused dies, each one of his legal heirs can make the demand for
	the prescribed punishment. It is, however, strange that Imam Shafi'i
	excludes the husband and the wife from this right on the ground that
	their marriage bond breaks with death, and the accusation against
	one spouse does not affect the lineage of the other. The fact is
	that both these arguments are weak. When it is conceded that the
	right to demand the prescribed punishment for qazf is inheritable,
	it will be against the Qur'an to exclude the husband and the wife
	from the exercise of this right on the ground that their marriage
	bond breaks with death, because the Qur'an itself has declared each
	of them as an heir on the death of the other. As for the argument
	that the accusation against one does not affect the lineage of the
	other, it may be correct in the case of the husband but it is
	absolutely wrong in the case of the wife; the man whose wife is
	accused of zina has the lineage of his children automatically
	rendered doubtful. Moreover, it is not correct to think that the
	punishment for qazf has been prescribed only to protect the lineage
	of the people; honour along with lineage is equally important. Thus,
	it is no less damaging for a gentleman or a lady that his wife or
	her husband is accused of zina. Therefore, if the right to demand
	the prescribed punishment for qazf be inheritable there is no reason
	why the husband and the wife should be debarred from exercising that
	right. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(8) After
	it has been established that a person has committed qazf, the only
	thing that can save him from the prescribed punishment is that he
	should produce four witnesses who should give evidence in the court
	that they have seen the accused committing zina practically with
	such and such a man or woman. According to the Hanafis, all the four
	witnesses should appear at one and the same time in the court and
	they should give evidence all together. For if they appear one after
	the other, each one of them will become a qazf, and will need four
	witnesses to support him. But this is a weak argument. The correct
	position is the one adopted by Imam Shafi`i and `Uthman al-Bani,
	that it is immaterial whether the witnesses appear all together or
	come one after the other; it is rather better that as in other cases
	the witnesses should come one after the other and give evidence. The
	Hanafis hold that it is not necessary that the witnesses should be
	righteous; even if the qazif produces four immoral persons as
	witnesses, he will escape the prescribed punishment of qazf, and the
	accused also the prescribed punishment of zina, because the
	witnesses are not righteous. However, if the qazif produces
	witnesses who are unbelieving, or blind, or slave, or those already
	convicted of qazf, he will not escape the punishment. Imam Shafi`i
	holds that if the qzif produces witnesses who are immoral, he and
	his witnesses, all will become liable to the prescribed punishment,
	and the same is the opinion of Imam Malik. But the view of the
	Hanafis in this matter appears to be nearer the truth. According to
	them, if the witnesses are righteous, the qazif will be acquitted of
	the charge of qazf, and the crime of zina will become established
	against the accused. But if the witnesses are not righteous, the
	qazif's crime of qazf, the maqzuf's crime of zina and the evidence
	of the witnesses will all stand doubtful, and none will be held
	liable to punishment on account of the element of doubt.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(9) The
	Qur'an has given three Commandments in respect of the person who
	fails to produce proper evidence which can cause his acquittal of
	the crime of qazf, 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a) He
	should be awarded 80 stripes,

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(c) He
	himself is a transgressor. After this the Qur'an says: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;
	.... except those who repent of it and mend their ways; Allah is
	Forgiving and Merciful.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	question arises: To which of these three Commands is the forgiveness
	due to repentance and reformation as mentioned in the verse related?
	The jurists are agreed that it is not related to the first Command.
	That is, repentance will not render the punishment null and void,
	and the criminal will be given flogging in any case. The jurists are
	also agreed that the forgiveness is related to the third Command,
	which means that after repentance and reformation the criminal will
	no longer be a sinner and Allah will forgive him. (Here the
	difference of opinion is Only in this matter whether the criminal
	becomes a sinner due to the crime of qazf itself, or after his
	conviction by the court. Imam Shafi`i and Laith bin Sa`d hold that
	he becomes a sinner due to the crime of qazf itself, and therefore,
	they reject his evidence thenceforth. On the contrary, lmam Abu
	Hanifah, his companions and lmam Malik maintain that he becomes a
	sinner after the enforcement of the sentence; therefore, till the
	enforcement of the sentence his evidence will be acceptable. But the
	truth is that in the sight of Allah the criminal becomes a sinner as
	a result of the crime of qazf itself, but for the people his being a
	sinner depends on his conviction by the court and the enforcement of
	the punishment on him). Now as far as the second Command, viz. &quot;The
	evidence of qazif should not be accepted in future&quot;, is
	concerned, there has been a great difference of opinion among the
	jurists as to whether the sentence &quot;. .. except those who
	repent. .&quot; is related to this or not. One group says that this
	sentence is related only to the last Command. That is, a person who
	repents and mends his ways, will no longer be a sinner in the sight
	of Allah and the common Muslims, but the first two Commands will
	remain effective, i.e. the sentence will be enforced on him and his
	evidence will never be accepted in future. To this group belong
	eminent jurists like Qazi Shuraih, Said bin Musayyab, Said bin
	Jubair, Hasan Basri, Ibrahim Nakha`i Ibn Sirin, Makhul, `Abdur
	Rahman bin Zaid, Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf, Zufar, Muhammad, Sufyan
	_Thauri, and Hasan bin Saleh. The other group says that the
	clause... except those who repent . ..&quot; is not related to the
	first Command but is related to the other two. That is, after
	repentance, not only will the evidence of the offender who has been
	punished for qazf be acceptable, but he wilt also not be regarded as
	a sinner. This group comprises jurists of the status of `Ata',
	Ta'us, Mujahid, Sha`bi, Qasim bin Muhammad, Salim, Zuhri, `Ikrimah,
	`Umar bin `Abdul `Aziz, Ibn Abi Nujaih, Sideman bin Yasar, Masruq,
	Zahhak, Malik bin Anas, `Uthman al-Batti, Laith bin Sa`d, Shafi`i,
	Ahmad bin Hanbal and Ibn Jarir Tabari. Among other arguments, these
	scholars cite the verdict of Hadrat `Umar which he gave in the case
	of Mughirah bin Shu`bah. For, according to some traditions, after
	enforcing the punishment, Hadrat `Umar said to Abu Bakrah and his
	two companions: &quot;If you repent (or confess your lie), I shall
	accept your evidence in future, otherwise not.&quot; His companions
	confessed but not Abu Bakrah. On the face of it, it appears to be a
	strong argument. But from the details given above of Mughirah bin
	Shu`bah's case, it would become obvious that it is not correct to
	cite this precedent in support of this view. For in that case, there
	was complete unanimity as far as the act (of sexual intercourse) was
	concerned and Mughirah bin Shu`bah himself did not deny it. The
	point of dispute was the identity of the woman. Mughirah said that
	she was his own wife, whom the accusers had mistaken for Umm Jamil.
	Then it had also been established that the wife of Hadrat Mughirah
	and Umm Jamil resembled with each other to a degree that from the
	distance and in the kind of light that they were seen, the former
	could Be mistaken for the latter. But the circumstantial evidence
	was wholly in favour of Mughirah bin Shu'bah, and a witness of the
	case also had admitted that the woman was not clearly visible. That
	is why Hadrat `Umar decided the case in favour of Mughirah bin
	Shu`bah, and after punishing Abu Bakrah, said the words as mentioned
	in the above-quoted traditions. This clearly shows that the real
	intention of Hadrat 'Umar was to impress on the accusers that they
	should confess that they had given way to undue suspicion and that
	they should repent of accusing people on the basis of such
	suspicions in future, otherwise their evidence would never be
	accepted. From this it cannot be concluded that in the eyes of
	Hadrat 'Umar the evidence of a person whose falsehood had been
	established, could become acceptable just after he had repented. The
	truth is that in this matter the view of the former group is more
	sound. None except Allah can know whether a person has repented
	sincerely or not. If a person repents before us, we may not consider
	him as a transgressor afterwards, but once his falsehood has been
	established, we cannot afford to trust him in future simply because
	he has uttered repentance. Moreover, the words in the Text
	themselves indicate that except those who repent . .. &quot; is
	related only to &quot;. .. they themselves are transgressors&quot; .
	The reason is that the first two things, in the sentence ---&quot;
	flog them with eighty stripes, and never accept their evidence
	afterwards&quot;--have been given in the imperative form, while the
	third thing-- &quot;they themselves are transgressors&quot;-is a
	predicate. Then the clause&quot;... except those who repent ...&quot;
	just after the predicate itself indicates that the exception relates
	to the predicate and not to the two imperative sentences.
	Nevertheless, if it is conceded that the exception is not confined
	to the last sentence, one does not understand why it should be made
	to apply to &quot;never accept their evidence&quot; only and not
	extended to &quot;flog them with eighty stripes&quot; also. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(10) A
	question may be asked: Why should not the exception in &quot;...
	.except those who repent....&quot; be made applicable to the first
	Command also? Qazf after all is a sort of defamation. Why should not
	a person who confesses his guilt, apologizes and repents, be let
	off, when Allah Himself says: &quot;... except those who repent and
	trend their ways; Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. &quot; It will be
	strange that Allah forgives while the people do not forgive. The
	answer is that the act of Taubah (repentance) is not merely uttering
	the word Taubah with the tongue; it lather implies having a feeling
	of regrets, a resolve to reform and an inclination to do right; and
	this can only be known to Allah whether a person has repented
	sincerely or not. That is why on repentance worldly punishments are
	not forgiven but only punishments of the Hereafter; and that is why,
	Allah dces not say that if the offenders repent, they they be
	forgiven, but says: &quot;For those who repent, Allah is Forgiving
	and Merciful.&quot; If the worldly punishments are also excused on
	repentance, there will be no offender who will not offer repentance
	in order to escape his sentence. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(11)
	Another side of the question is that if a person cannot produce
	witnesses in support of his accusation, it may not necessarily mean
	that he is a liar. Is it not possible that he be true in his
	accusation, yet he may fail to produce evidence? Then, how is it
	that he should be condemned as a sinner on account of his failure to
	produce witnesses not only by the people but also by Allah ? The
	answer is that even if a person is an eye-witness to the immorality
	committed by an other person, he will be considered as a sinner for
	publicizing the act and accusing the offender without necessary
	evidence. The Divine Law does not want that if a person gets
	polluted in filth in a private place, the other person should start
	spreading the filth in the .whole society. If he has any knowledge
	of the presence of the filth, there are two ways open for him:
	either he should let it remain where it is, or he should produce a
	proof of its existence, so that the officials of the Islamic State
	should cleanse it. There is no third way for him. If he publicizes
	it, he will be committing the crime of spreading the filth
	everywhere; and if he brings the matter to the notice of the
	officials without satisfactory evidence, they will not be able to
	deal with it effectively. The result will be that the failure of the
	case will become a means of spreading the filth and encouraging the
	wicked element of society. Therefore, the one who commits qazf
	without necessary proof and evidence, will in any case be a sinner
	even if he be we in his accusation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(12) The
	Hanafi jurists hold that the qazif should be given a lighter
	punishment than the one who is convicted of zina. That is, he.
	should be given eighty stripes but flogging should be less intense,
	the reason being that his being a liar is not certain in the offense
	for which he is being punished. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(13)
	Majority of the jurists including the Hanafis are of the view that
	only one punishment will be enforced on the qazif no matter how
	often he repeats the accusation before or during the enforcement of
	the punishment. If after the punishment the qazif goes on repeating
	the same accusation, the punishment which he has already been
	awarded, will suffice. however, if after the enforcement of the
	prescribed punishment, he brings another charge of zina against the
	accused, he will be tried again for the new charge of qazf. Abu
	Bakrah after getting the punishment in the case against Mughirah bin
	Shu`bah, went on repeating openly that he bore witness that Mughirah
	had committed zina. Hadrat `Umar wanted to try him again, but as he
	was repeating the same accusation, Hadrat `Ali expressed the opinion
	that he could not be tried again and Hadrat `Umar conceded it. After
	this the jurists became almost unanimous that a qazif who has
	received the prescribed punishment for a crime, cannot he tried
	again unless he commits a fresh crime of qazf. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(14)
	There is a difference among the jurists with regard to qazf against
	a group. According to the Hanafi s, if a person accuses a number of
	persons in one word or in more words separately, he will be awarded
	only one prescribed punishment unless, of course, lie commits a-
	fresh crime of qazf after the enforcement of the first punishment.
	The words of the verse &quot;Those who accuse chaste woman...
	&quot;-indicate that the accuser of one person or more persons
	deserves only one punishment. Moreover, there can be no zina for
	which at least two persons cannot be accused, but in spite of that
	the Law-giver has prescribed only one punishment and not two, one
	for accusing the woman and the other for accusing the man. Contrary
	to this, Imam Shafi`i holds that the person who accuses a group of
	persons, whether in one word or in more words separately, will be
	awarded as many punishments as the number of the persons accused,
	one for each. The same is the opinion of `Uthman al-Batti. However,
	the ruling of Ibn Abi Laila, to which Sha`bi and Auza`i also
	subscribe, is that the one who accuses a group of persons of zina in
	one word, deserves one punishment, and the one who accuses them
	separately in separate words, deserves separate punishments, one for
	each.

	verses were sent down some time after the preceding verses. The Law
	of Qazf prescribed the punishment for the person who accused the
	other man or woman of zina, and did not produce witnesses to prove
	his charge, but the question naturally arose, what should a man do
	if he finds his own wife involved in zina? If he kills her, he will
	be guilty of murder and punishable; if he goes to get witnesses, the
	offender might escape; if he tries to ignore the matter, he cannot
	do so for long. He can, of course, divorce the woman, but in this
	case there will be no moral or physical punishment either for the
	woman or her seducer; and if the illicit intercourse results in
	pregnancy, he will have to suffer the burden of bringing up another
	person's child. Initially this question was raised by Hadrat Sa`d
	bin `Ubadah as an hypothetical case, who said that if he happened to
	see such a thing in his own house, he would not go in search of
	witnesses, but would settle the matter there and then with the
	sword. (Bukhari, Muslim). But soon afterwards actual cases were
	brought before the Holy Prophet by the husbands who were
	eyewitnesses of this thing. According to traditions related by
	Abdullah bin Mas`ud and Ibn `Umar, an Ansar Muslim (probably
	`Uwaimir `Ajlani) came to the Holy Prophet and said, &quot;O
	Messenger of Allah, if a person finds another man with his wife, and
	utters an accusation, you will enforce the prescribed punishment of
	qazf On him; if he commits murder, you will have him killed; if he
	keeps quiet, he will remain involved in anguish; then, what should
	he do?&quot; At this the Holy Prophet prayed, &quot;O Allah, give a
	solution of this problem.&quot; (Muslim, Bukhari, Abu Da'ud, Ahmad,
	Nasa`i). Ibn 'Abbas has reported that Hilal bin Umayyah presented
	the case of his wife whom he had himself witnessed involved in the
	act of sin. The Holy Prophet said, &quot;Bring your proof, otherwise
	you will have the prescribed punishment of qazf inflicted on you.&quot;
	At this a panic spread among the Companions, and Hilal said, &quot;I
	swear by Allah Who has sent you as a Prophet that I am speaking the
	truth: I have seen it with my eyes and heard it with my ears: I am
	sure Allah will send down a Command, which will protect my back
	(from the punishment). So, this verse was revealed.&quot; (Bukhari,
	Ahmad, Abu Da'ud). The legal procedure which has been laid down in
	this verse, is termed as the Law of Li `an.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	details of the cases which the Holy Prophet judged in accordance
	with the Law of Li'an are found in the books of Hadith and these
	form the source and basis of this law. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to the details of Hilai bin Umayyah's case as reported in sibah
	Sitta, Musnad Ahmad and Tafsir Ibn Jarir, on the authority of Ibn
	`Abbas and Anas bin Malik, both Hilai and his wife were presented
	before the Holy Prophet, who first of all apprised them of the
	Divine Law, and then said: &quot;You should note it well that the
	punishment of the Hereafter is much severer than the punishment of
	this world.&quot; Hilai submitted that his charge was absolutely
	correct. The woman denied it. The Holy Prophet then said: &quot;Let
	us proceed according to the Law of Li'an.&quot; So, Hilal stood up
	first and swore oaths according to the Qur'anic Command. The Holy
	Prophet went on reminding them again and again: &quot;Allah knows
	that one of you is certainly a liar: then, will one of you repent?&quot;
	Before Hilal swore for the fifth time, the people who were present
	there, said to him, &quot;Fear God: the punishment of the world is
	lighter than of the Hereafter. The fifth oath will make the
	punishment obligatory on you. &quot; But Hilal said that God Who had
	protected his back (from punishment) in this world, will also spare
	him in the Hereafter. After this he swore the fifth oath, too. Then
	the woman began to swear oaths. Before she swore the fifth oath, she
	was also stopped and counseled, &quot;Fear God: the worldly
	punishment is easier to bear than the punishment of the Hereafter.
	This last oath will make the Divine punishment obligatory on you.&quot;
	Hearing this the woman hesitated a little. The people thought that
	she was going to make the confession. But instead of that she said:
	&quot;I do not want to put my clan to disgrace for ever,&quot; and
	swore for the fifth time, too. At this the Holy Prophet ordered
	separation between them and ruled that her child after birth would
	be attributed to her and not to the man; that nobody after that
	would blame her or her child; that anybody who accused either of
	them would incur the punishment of qazf and that she had no right
	left to claim maintenance, etc. from Hilal, during her Legal waiting
	period, because she was being separated neither on account of
	divorce nor due to the husband's death. Then the Holy Prophet asked
	the people to see whether the child on birth took after Hilai or the
	man who was being accused in connection with the woman. After
	delivery when it was seen that the child took . after the other man,
	the Holy Prophet said: `If there had been no swearing of the oaths
	(or if Allah's Book had not settled the matter before this), I would
	have dealt with this woman most severely.&quot;</P>

	details of the case of `Uwaimir `Ajlani have been cited in Bukhari,
	Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah and Musnad Ahmad, on the
	authority of Sahl bin Sa'd Sa'idi and Ibn `Umar (may Allah be
	pleased with them both). According to these, 'Uwaimir and his wife
	were both summoned to the Prophet's Mosque. Before proceeding
	against them in accordance with the Law of Li an, the Holy Prophet
	warned them thrice, saying: &quot;Allah knows full well that one of
	you is a liar: then, will one of you repent ?&quot; When neither
	repented, they were told to exercise Li'an. After that `Uwaimir
	said, &quot;O Messenger of Allah, now if I keep this woman, I would
	be a liar&quot; and then he divorced her thrice there and then even
	without the Holy Prophet's permission to do so. According to Sahl
	bin Sa`d, the Holy Prophet enforced the divorce to separate them,
	and said, &quot;There shall be separation between the husband and
	the wife if they exercise Li'an. 'This became established as a
	Sunnah that the couple who swore against each other would separate
	never to marry again. Ibn `Umar only says this that the Holy Prophet
	enforced separation between them. Sahl bin Sa`d, however, adds that
	the woman was pregnant and `Uwaimir said that it was not due to his
	seed; so the child was attributed to the mother. The practice that
	thus became established was that such a child would inherit the
	mother and the mother him.

	subject to the law of retaliation for killing an unmarried
	adulterer. But the majority of jurists are of the opinion that the
	man will be exonerated from retaliation only when he produces four
	witnesses to establish zina, or if the murdered person himself
	confesses before death that he committed zina with the wife of the
	murderer, and if it is also confirmed that the murdered person was a
	married man. (Nail al-Autar, vol. IV, p. 228).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	Law of Li `an cannot be applied mutually at home, but in a court of
	law in front of the Judge. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3)
	Exercise of li`an is not the sole right of the man; the woman also
	has a right to demand it in a court of law if her husband accuses
	her of zina, or denies fatherhood of her child. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) There
	is a difference of opinion among the jurists as to whether li `an
	can be resorted to between any husband and his wife, or whether they
	have to satisfy certain conditions. Imam Shafi'i holds that only
	that husband whose oath is legally reliable and who can exercise the
	right of divorce, can swear the oaths of li `an. In other words,
	sanity and maturity according to him, are the sufficient conditions
	which entitle a husband to exercise li'an no matter whether the
	spouses are Muslim or non-Muslim, slave or free, and whether their
	evidence is acceptable or not, and whether the Muslim husband has a
	Muslim or a zimmi wife. Imam Malik and Imam Ahmad have also given
	almost the same opinion. But the Hanafis maintain that li'an can be
	exercised only by free Muslim spouses, who should not have been
	convicted of qazf previously. If both husband and wife are non
	Muslim, or slaves, or convicted of qazf previously, they cannot
	exercise li `an against each other. Furthermore, if the woman was
	ever found guilty of an illicit or doubtful relationship with
	another man, exercise of li `an will not be valid. The Hanafis have
	imposed these conditions, because according to them, there is no
	other difference between li `an and qazf than this: -the other man
	commits qazf, he is given the prescribed punishment, but if the
	husband himself commits it, he can escape the punishment by
	exercising li `an. In all other respects, li `an and qazf are
	identical. Moreover, since according to the Hanafis, the oaths of li
	an are in the nature of evidence, they do not concede this right to
	a person who is not legally fit to give evidence. But the truth is
	that in this matter the position of the Hanafis is weak, and the
	opinion of Imam Shafi`i is correct, because the Qur'an has not made
	the accusation of the wife a component part of the verse of qazf,
	but has prescribed a separate law for it. Therefore, it cannot be
	linked with the law of qazf and treated under the conditions
	prescribed for qazf. Then, the wording of the verse of li'an is
	different from the wording of the verse of qazf and the two lay down
	separate injunctions. Therefore, the law of li `an should be derived
	from the verse of li `an and not from the verse of qazf. For
	instance, according to the verse of qazf, the person who accuses
	chaste women (muhsanat) of zina, deserves to be punished. But in the
	verse of li `an, there is no condition of the chastity of the wife.
	A woman might have committed sins in life, but if she repents later
	on and marries somebody, the husband is not authorised by the verse
	of li `an to accuse her unjustly whenever he likes, and to deny
	fatherhood of her children simply because she had once lived in sin.
	The other equally important reason is that there is a world of
	difference between accusing a wife and accusing the other woman. The
	law cannot treat the two alike. A man has nothing to do with the
	other woman. He is neither attached to her emotionally, nor his
	honour, his family relations and rights are at stake nor his
	lineage. The only meaningful interest he can have in the woman's
	character can be his desire to see a morally pure and clean society.
	Contrary to this, his relationship with his wife is deep and of
	varied nature. She is the custodian of the purity of his race, of
	his property and his house; she is his life partner, sharer of his
	secrets, and with her he is attached in most delicate and deep
	feelings. If she is morally corrupt, it will deal a serious blow to
	his honour, his interests and his progeny. These two things,
	therefore, cannot be considered alike, and the law cannot treat them
	as equal to each other. Is an evil affair of the wife of a zimmi, or
	a slave, or a convicted husband in any way different, or less
	serious, in consequences than that of the wife of a free, mature and
	sound Muslim? If the husband himself sees his wife involved in zina
	with another person, or has reasons to believe that his wife is
	pregnant by illicit intercourse, how can he be denied the right of
	li 'an? And if he is denied this right, what else is there in our
	law which can help him out of his awkward situation? The intention
	of the Qur'an seems to be to open a way out of a difficult situation
	for married couples in which a husband may find himself placed due
	to the wife's immorality or illicit pregnancy, or a wife due to the
	husband's false accusation or unjustified denial of the fatherhood
	of her child. This is not particularly the need of the free and
	sound Muslims alone; there is in fact nothing in the Qur'anic Text
	which may confine it to them only. As for the argument that the
	Qur'an has described the oaths of li `an as evidence (shahadat), and
	therefore the conditions of evidence will apply here, the logical
	implication would be that in case a righteous and just husband whose
	evidence is acceptable, takes the necessary oaths, and the wife
	declines to take the oaths, she would have to be stoned to death,
	because her immorality would thus become established. But it is
	strange that in this case the Hanafis do not recommend stoning. This
	is a clear proof of the fact that they too do not regard the oaths
	as exactly identical with evidence. The truth is that though the
	Qur'an describes the oaths of li `an as evidence, it does not regard
	them as evidence in the technical sense, otherwise it would have
	required the woman to swear eight oaths and not four. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) Li
	`an is not necessitated by an allusion or expression of doubt or
	suspicion, but only when the husband accuses his wife clearly of
	zina, or denies in plain words that the child is his. Imam Malik and
	Laith bin Sa`d impose an additional condition that the husband while
	exercising li `an must say that he has himself seen his wife
	involved in zina. But this is an unnecessary restriction which has
	no basis whatever in the Qur'an and Hadith. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) If
	after accusing his wife, the husband declines to swear the oaths,
	the verdict of Imam Abu Hanifah and his companions is that he will
	be imprisoned and shall not be released until he exercises li `an or
	confesses the falsehood of his accusation, in which case he will be
	awarded the prescribed punishment of qazf On the contrary, Imam
	Malik, Shafi`i, Hasan bin Saleh and Laith bin Sa`d express the
	opinion that refusal to exercise li`an itself amounts to confessing
	one's being a liar, which makes the prescribed punishment of qazf
	obligatory. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) If
	after the swearing of oaths by the husband, the wife declines to
	lake the oaths, the Hanafis give the opinion that she should be
	imprisoned and should not be released until she exercises li `an, or
	else confesses her guilt of zina. On the contrary, the other Imams
	(as mentioned in clause 6 above) say that in this case she will be
	stoned to death. They base their argument on the Qur'anic
	injunction: &quot;...it shall avert the punishment from her if she
	swears four times by Allah,&quot; Now that she declines to swear the
	oaths, she inevitably deserves the punishment. But the weakness in
	this argument is that the Qur'an does not specify here the nature of
	&quot;punishment&quot;; it simply mentions punishment. If it is
	argued that punishment here means the punishment of zina only, the
	answer is that for the punishment of zina the Qur'an has imposed the
	condition of four witnesses in clear words, and this condition
	cannot be fulfilled by four oaths sworn by one person. The husband's
	oaths can suffice for him to escape the punishment of qazf and for
	the wife to face the injunction of li `an, but they are not enough
	to prove the charge of zina against her. The woman's refusal to
	swear the oaths in self-defense certainly creates a suspicion, and a
	strong suspicion indeed, but a prescribed punishment cannot be
	enforced on the basis of suspicions. This thing cannot be considered
	as analogous with the prescribed punishment of qazf for the man,
	because his qazf is established, and that is why he is made to
	exercise li `an. But contrary to this, the woman's guilt of zina is
	not established unless she herself makes a confession of it or four
	eye-witnesses are produced to prove it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(8) If
	the woman is pregnant at the time of li `an according to Imam Ahmad,
	li`an itself suffices to absolve the husband from the responsibility
	for pregnancy whether he has denied accepting it or not. Imam
	Shafi`i, however, says that accusation of zina by the husband and
	his refusal to accept responsibility for pregnancy are not one and
	the same thing. Therefore, unless the husband categorically refuses
	to accept the responsibility for pregnancy, he will be considered as
	responsible for it in spite of the accusation of zina by him,
	because the woman's being adulterous dces not necessarily mean that
	her pregnancy is also due to zina. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(9) Imam
	Malik, Imam Shafi`i and Imam Ahmad concede the husband's right to
	deny responsibility for pregnancy during pregnancy, and allow him
	the right of li`an on that basis. But Imam Abu Hanifah says that if
	the basis for the man's accusation is not Zina, but only this that
	he has found pregnancy in the woman when it could not possibly be
	due to him, exercise of li 'an should be deferred until after
	delivery because sometimes symptoms of pregnancy appear due to some
	disease and not actual pregnancy. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(10) If a
	husband denies fatherhood of a child, there is a consensus that
	li`an becomes necessary There is also a consensus that after he has
	accepted e child once (whether it is in clear words or by
	implication, e.g. by receiving congratulatory messages on its birth,
	or by treating it lovingly like. one's own child and taking due
	interest in its bringing up), he loses his right to deny him later,
	and if he does so, he makes himself liable to the prescribed
	punishment of qazf. There is, however, a difference of opinion as to
	how long the father retains a right to deny fatherhood of the child.
	According to Imam Malik, if the husband was present at home while
	the wife was pregnant, he can deny the responsibility from the time
	of pregnancy till the time of delivery; after that he will have no
	right. However, if he was away from home and delivery took place in
	his absence, he can deny the child's fatherhood as soon as it comes
	to his knowledge. According to Imam Abu Hanifah, if he denies within
	a day or two of the child's birth, he will be absolved from the
	responsibility of the child after exercising li`an, but if he denies
	after a year or two, li`an will be valid, but he will not be
	absolved from the responsibility of the child. According to Imam Abu
	Yusuf, the father has the right to deny fatherhood within 40 days of
	the child's birth. or knowledge of its birth; after that he will
	have no right. But this restriction of 40 days is meaningless. The
	correct view is that of Imam Abu Hanifah that fatherhood can be
	denied within a day or two of the child's birth or knowledge of its
	birth, unless one is hindered from doing so due to a sound and
	genuine reason. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(11) If a
	husband accuses a divorced wife of zina, according to Imam Abu
	Hanifah, this will be a case of qazf and not of li `an. Li `an can
	be resorted to between the spouses and cannot be extended to a
	divorced woman unless it is a retractable divorce and the accusation
	is made within the period of retraction. But Imam Malik holds that
	this will be qazf only if it does not involve the question of
	accepting or denying the responsibility of pregnancy or fatherhood
	of the child. If it is not that, the man has the right to exercise
	li `an even after pronouncing the final divorce, because in that
	case he would not be having recourse to li `an for the purposes of
	bringing infamy on the woman but to absolve himself from the
	responsibility of the child who, he believes, is not his. The same
	almost is the opinion of Imam Shafi`i. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(12)
	There is a complete consensus of opinion in respect of certain legal
	implications of li `an, but certain others have been disputed by the
	jurists. The agreed ones are the following: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Neither
	the woman nor the man is liable to punishment. If the man denies
	fatherhood of the child, it will be attributed to the mother alone;
	it will neither be attributed to the father nor will inherit him;
	the child will inherit the mother and the mother him. Thereafter
	nobody will have the right to call the woman adulterous nor the
	child illegitimate, whether the people might be wholly sure of her
	being adulterous under the circumstances at the time of li `an. Any
	person who repeats the old charge against the woman or her child,
	will make himself liable to the punishment of qazf. The woman's
	dowry will remain intact, but she will not be entitled to claim
	maintenance, etc. from the man, and she will become forbidden to him
	for ever, 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is,
	however, a difference of opinion in respect of two things: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a) After
	li `an how will separation be effected between the husband and the
	wife? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b) Is it
	possible for them to re-unite in marriage after they have been
	separated on account of li'an? 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	regards the first question, Imam Shafi'i holds the opinion that as
	soon as a man has exercised his li'an, the woman stands
	automatically separated whether she refutes the man's charge by her
	li `an or not. Imam Malik, Laith bin S`ad and Zufar maintain that
	separation is effected when both a man and a woman have exercised
	their li `an one after the other. Imam Abu Hanifah, Abu Yusuf and
	Muhammad hold that separation dces not take place automatically
	after li`an, but it is effected by the judge. If the husband
	pronounces divorce, it takes effect, otherwise the judge will
	announce their separation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Regarding
	the second, question, the opinion of Imam Malik, Abu Yusuf, Zufar,
	Sufyan _Thauri, Ishaq bin Rahaviyah, Shafi`i, Ahmad bin Hanbal and
	Hasan bin Zaid is that the spouses who have been separated due to
	li'an, are forbidden to each other for ever. Even if they wish to
	remarry, they cannot do so in any case. The same is the opinion also
	of Hadrat `Umar, Hadrat `Ali and Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas`ud.
	Contrary to this, Said bin Musayyab, Ibrahim Nakha`i, Sha`bi, Said
	bin Jubair, Abu Hanifah and Muhammad (may Allah be pleased with them
	all) opine that if the husband confesses his lie, and he is awarded
	the prescribed punishment for qazf, the two can re-unite in
	marriage. They argue that it is li `an which makes them unlawful for
	each other. As long as they stand by their li `an, they will remain
	forbidden for each other, but when the husband confesses his lie and
	receives the punishment, li `an will become null and void and so
	will their prohibition to marry each other again.

	is an allusion to the slander against Hadrat `A'ishah. Allah has
	Himself described it as Ifk (false accusation, calumny) which
	implies its total refutation <BR>From here begins the mention of the
	incident which provided the occasion of this Surah's revelation. We
	have reproduced the initial part of it in the Introduction as
	related by Hadrat `A' ishah herself; the rest of it is reproduced
	below. She savs: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Rumours
	about this slander went on spreading in the city for about a month,
	which caused great distress and anguish to the Holy Prophet. I cried
	due to helplessness and my parents were sick with mental agony. At
	last one day the Holy Prophet visited us and he sat near me, which
	he had not done since the slander had staved. Feeling that something
	decisive was going to happen that day, Hadrat Abu Bakr and Umm Ruman
	(Hadrat `A'ishah's mother) also sat near us. The Holy Prophet
	started the conversation, saying: `A'ishah, I have heard this and
	this about you: if you are innocent, I expect that Allah will
	declare your innocence. But it u you have committed a sin, you
	should offer repentance and ask for Allah's forgiveness; when a
	servant (of Allah) confesses his guilt and repents, Allah forgives
	him.' Hearing these words, tears dried in my eyes. I looked up to my
	father expecting that he would reply to the Holy Prophet, but he
	said, `Daughter, I do not knave what I should say.' Then I turned to
	my mother, but she also did not know what to say. At last I said,
	`You have all heard something about me and believed it. Now if I say
	that I am innocent-and Allah is my witness that I am innocent-you
	will not believe me; and if I confess something which I never didand
	Allah knows that I never did it-you will believe me.' At that time I
	tried to call to memory the name of Prophet Jacob but could not
	recall it. Therefore in view of the predicament that I was placed
	in, I said, ' `I cannot but repeat the words which the father of
	Prophet Joseph had spoken: fa-sabrun jamil: I will bear this
	patiently with good grace.' (XII: 83). Saying this I lay down and
	turned to the other side. I was thinking that Allah was aware of my
	innocence, and He would certainly reveal the truth, but I could
	never imagine that Divine Revelation would come down in my defense,
	which the people will read and recite till the Last Day. What I
	thought probable was that the Holy Prophet would see a dream in
	which Allah would indicate my innocence. But in the meantime
	suddenly, the state of receiving Revelation appeared on the Holy
	Prophet, when pearl-like drops of perspiration used to gather on his
	face even in severe winter. We all held our breath and sat silent.
	As for me I was fearless, but my parents seemed to be struck with
	fear; they did not know what the Divine Revelation would be. When
	the Revelation was over, the Holy Prophet seemed to be very pleased.
	Overjoyed with happiness the first words he spoke were:
	`Congratulations, `A'ishah, Allah has sent down proof of your
	innocence' and then he recited these ten verses (11-21). At this my
	mother said to me, `Get up and thank the Holy Prophet.' I said, 'I
	shall neither thank him nor you two, but thank Allah Who has sent
	down my absolution. You did not even so, much as contradict the
	charge against me.' (This is not the translation of any one
	tradition, but the substance of many traditions which are found in
	the books of Hadith in connection with the incident of the slander
	against Hadrat `A'ishah). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One
	subtle point to be understood here is that before mentioning the
	absolution of Hadrat 'A'ishah, a full section of verses has been
	devoted to the Commandments pertaining to zina, qazf and li'an by
	which Allah means to admonish that zina is not a slight matter which
	may be used as a means of entertaining the people in a gathering. It
	is very serious.'If the accuser is right in his accusation he should
	produce witnesses, and get a most horrible punishment inflicted upon
	the adulterer and the adulteress. If the accuser is false, he
	deserves to be given 80 stripes, so that nobody may dare to bring a
	false charge against the other person. And if the accuser is a
	husband, he will have to exercise /i an in a court of law to settle
	the matter. So, none who utters such an accusation will have peace.
	The Islamic society which has been brought about for the purpose of
	establishing goodness and piety in the world, can neither tolerate
	zina as a means of entertainment nor endure loose talk about it as a
	diversion and amusement.

	be a blessing in disguise for you.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As
	mentioned in the Introduction above, the hypocrites had planned to
	inflict a defeat on the Muslims on the moral front, which was their
	real field of superiority and responsible for their victory on every
	other front against the opponents. But Allah turned this mischief
	into a means of strength for the Muslims. On this occasion, the
	conduct and attitude adopted by the Holy Prophet, Hadrat Abu Bakr
	and his family, and the Muslims at large proved beyond any doubt
	that they were the purest people morally, tolerant and just in
	nature, noble and forbearing in character. If the Holy Prophet had
	wished he could have got the people responsible for the attack on
	his honor beheaded immediately. But he bore everything with patience
	for a whole month. And when Divine injunction came down from Allah,
	he enforced the punishment for qazf only on those three Muslims
	whose guilt was established, and even spared the hypocrites. Hadrat
	Abu Bakr's own relative, whose whole family he had been supporting
	all along, continued heaping disgrace on him publicly, but that
	noble man neither severed his family relations with him nor stopped
	monetary help to him and his family. None of the wives of the Holy
	Prophet took the least part in the slander nor even expressed the
	slightest approval of it. So much so that Hadrat Zainab (a wife of
	the Holy Prophet), for whose sake her real sister, Hamnah bint
	Jahsh, was taking part in the slander, did not utter anything about
	her rival (Hadrat `A'ishah) except good words. According to Hadrat
	`A'ishah, herself: &quot;Zainab among the wives of the Holy Prophet
	was my strongest rival, but when in connection with the incident of
	the slander, the Holy Prophet asked her opinion of me, she said, `O
	Messenger of Allah, I swear by God that I have perceived nothing in
	her except piety'.&quot; Hadrat `A'ishah's own nobility of character
	can be judged by this that though Hassan bin Thabit had played a
	prominent role in the campaign of slander against her, she continued
	to treat him with due honour and esteem. When the people reminded
	her that he was the man who had slandered her, she retorted, `No, he
	it was who used to rebut the anti-Islamic poets on behalf of the
	Holy Prophet and Islam.' Such was the conduct and attitude of those
	people who were directly affected by the slander. As for the other
	Muslims, their attitude can be judged from one instance. When Hadrat
	Abu Ayyub Ansari's wife mentioned before him the rumours of the
	slander, he said, &quot;Mother of Ayyub, if you had been there in
	place of `A'ishah, would you have done that?&quot; She replied, &quot;By
	God, I would never have done it.&quot; Hadrat Ayyub then said,
	&quot;Well, `A'ishah is a much better woman than you. As for myself.
	if I had been in place of Safwan, I could never have entertained
	such an evil thought and Safwan is a better Muslim than I. &brvbar;
	Thus, the result of the mischief engineered by the hypocrites was
	contrary to what they had planned to achieve, and the Muslims
	emerged out of this test morally stronger than before.

	there was another aspect of goodness in it also. The Muslims came to
	understand fully that the Holy Prophet (may Allah's peace and
	blessings be upon him) had no knowledge of the unseen. He knew only
	that which Allah taught him. Beside that his knowledge was the same
	as that of a common man. For one full month he remained in great
	anxiety with regard to Hadrat `A'ishah. He would sometimes make
	enquiries from the maid-servant, sometimes from his other wives, and
	sometimes from Hadrat `Ali and Hadrat Usamah. At last when he spoke
	to Hadrat `A'ishah, he spoke only this: &quot;If you have committed
	the sin, you should offer repentance, and if you are innocent, I
	expect that Allah will declare your innocence.&quot; Had' he
	possessed any knowledge of the unseen, he would not have felt so
	upset&quot; nor would have made enquiries, nor counselled
	repentance. However, when Divine Message revealed the truth, he
	received that knowledge which he had not possessed for more than a
	month. Thus Allah arranged to safeguard the Muslims, through direct
	experience and observation, against exaggerated notions in which
	people generally get involved in regard to their religious leaders
	on account of excessive blind faith. Perhaps this was the reason why
	Allah withheld Revelation for a month, for if Revelation had been
	sent down on the very first day, it could not have had any
	beneficial effect.&nbsp;

	accusation and mischief. In some traditions it has been wrongly
	claimed that this verse refers to Hadrat Hassan bin _Thabit; this is
	actually due to a misunderstanding of the narrators themselves. As a
	matter of fact, Hadrat Hassan bin Thabit's only weakness was that he
	became involved in the mischief engineered by the hypocrites. Hafiz
	Ibn Kathir has rightly observed that if this tradition had not been

	greatest falsehood, rather a calumny, in this connection is the
	assertion by the Umayyads that it was Hadrat `Ali who had been
	referred to in this verse. A saying of Hisham bin `Abdul Malik has
	been cited in Bukhari, Tabarani and Baihaqi to the effect: &quot;The
	one who had the greatest share of responsibility in it&quot; refers
	to `Ali bin Abi Talib. The fact, however, is that Hadrat `Ali had no
	hand whatever in this mischief. The truth is that when Hadrat `Ali
	saw the Holy Prophet in a perturbed state of mind and the Holy
	Prophet asked for his counsel, he said: &quot;Allah in this matter
	has not laid any restriction on you: suitable women are plenty: you
	may if you like divorce `A'ishah and marry another woman.&quot; But
	this did not at all mean that Hadrat `Ali had supported the
	accusation against Hadrat `A'ishah. His object was only to allay the
	Holy Prophet's mental anguish.</P>

	may also be translated as: &quot;Why did they not have a good
	opinion of the people of their own community and society?&quot; The
	words in the Text are comprehensive and contain a subtle meaning
	which should be understood well. What happened concerning Hadrat
	`A'ishah and Safwan bin Mu`attal was only this: A woman belonging to
	the caravan (apart from the fact that she was the Holy Prophet's
	wife) was left behind, and a man belonging to the same caravan, who
	was also left behind, chanced to see her and brought her on his
	camel to the camp. Now if a person alleges that when the two found
	themselves alone, they became involved in sin, the accusation would
	imply two other hypotheses: First, if the accuser himself (whether
	man or woman) had been there, he would certainly have availed of the
	rare opportunity and committed the sinful act, for he had never
	before chanced upon a person of the opposite sex in a situation like
	this. Second, the accuser's assessment of the moral condition of the
	society he belongs to is that in that society there is no man or
	woman who could possibly have abstained from sin in similar
	circumstances. This will be the case when it involves any one man
	and any one woman. But supposing if the man and the woman happened
	to belong to the same place, and the woman who was left behind by
	chance was the wife, or sister, or daughter of a friend, or a
	relative, or a neighbor, or an acquaintance of the man, the matter
	would become much more serious and grave. Then it would mean that
	the one who utters such an accusation has a very poor and degraded
	opinion of himself as well as of his society, which has nothing to
	do with morality and good sense. No gentleman can imagine that if he
	finds a woman belonging to the family of a friend, or a neighbor or
	an acquaintance, stranded on the way, the first thing he would do
	would be to molest and dishonor her, and then would think of
	escorting her home. But here the matter was a thousand times more
	serious. The lady was no other than the wife of the Holy Prophet of
	Allah, whom every Muslim esteemed higher than his own mother, and
	whom Allah Himself had forbidden for every Muslim just like his own
	mother. The man was not only a follower of the same caravan and a
	soldier of the same army, and an inhabitant of the same city, but
	also a Muslim, who believed in the lady's husband to be the
	Messenger of Allah and his religious leader and guide, and had even
	followed him and fought in the most dangerous battle at Badr. Viewed
	against this background, it would seem that the person who uttered
	such an accusation and those who considered the accusation as
	probable, formed a very poor opinion not only of their moral selves
	but also of the whole society.</P>

	A question might be asked: Why did not the Holy Prophet and Hadrat
	Abu Bakr Siddiq reject it on the very first day, and why did they
	give it all that importance? The answer is that the position of the
	husband and the father is different from that of the common people.
	Though none else can know a woman better than her husband and a
	righteous husband cannot doubt the character of a virtuous and pious
	wife only on account of the people's accusations, but when the wife
	is accused, the husband is placed in a difficult situation. Even if
	he rejects it outright as a calumny, the accusers will not listen.
	They will rather say that the woman is clever and has beguiled the
	husband into believing that she is virtuous and pious whereas she is
	not. A similar situation is faced by the parents. They also cannot
	remove . the accusers' slander regarding their daughter's chastity

	bring four witnesses. This misunderstanding can arise if one does
	not keep in view the background of the actual incident. As a matter
	of fact, none of the accusers had actually witnessed the thing which
	they were uttering with their tongues. The only basis of their
	accusation was that Hadrat `A'ishah had been left behind from the
	caravan and afterwards Safwan had brought her to the camp on his
	camel. From this nobody with a little common sense could conclude
	that Hadrat `A'ishah's being left behind was intentional. These are

	`A'ishah has stated that after the revelation of verses 11-21
	absolving her from the accusation, Hadrat Abu Bakr swore that he
	would no longer support Mistah bin Uthatha. This was because the man
	had shown absolutely no regard for the relationship nor for the
	favours that Abu Bakr had all along been showing him and his family.
	At this verse 22 was revealed and Hadrat Abu Bakr, on hearing it,
	immediately said: &quot;By God! we do want that Allah should forgive
	us.&quot; Consequently he again started to help Mistah and in a more
	liberal manner than before. According to Hadrat `Abdullah bin
	`Abbas, some other Companions besides Hadrat Abu Bakr, also had
	sworn that they would discontinue helping those who had taken an
	active part in the slander. After the revelation of this verse, all
	of them revoked their oaths and the ill-will that had been created
	by the mischief was gone. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here a
	question may arise as to whether a person, who swears for something
	and Later on revokes the oath on fording that there was no good in
	it and adopts a better and more virtuous course, should offer
	expiation for breaking the oath or not. One group of the jurists is
	of the opinion that adoption of the virtuous course itself is the
	expiation and nothing more needs to be done. They base their
	argument on this verse where Allah commanded Hadrat Abu Bakr to
	revoke his oath but did not require him to atone for it. They also
	cite a Tradition of the Holy Prophet in support of their argument,
	saying: &quot;lf anybody takes an oath for something and later on
	fords that another course is better and adopts it, his adoption of a
	better course by itself is the atonement for breaking the oath.&quot;
		</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	group is of the view that there is a clear Commandment in the Qur'an
	concerning the breaking of oath (II: 225, V: 89), which has neither
	been abrogated by this verse nor clearly amended. Therefore the
	earlier Commandment stands. No doubt, Allah commanded Hadrat Abu
	Bakr to revoke his oath but He did not tell him that expiation was
	not necessary. As regards the Tradition of the Holy Prophet, it only
	means this that the sin of taking an oath for a wrong thing is wiped
	out when the right course is adopted; it does not absolve one from
	making expiation for the oath itself. Another Tradition of the Holy
	Prophet clarifies this view. He said: &quot;Whoso swears for
	something and then finds that another course is better than the one
	he had sworn for, he should adopt the better course and atone for
	his oath. &quot; This shows that expiation for breaking one's oath
	and expiation of the sin for not doing good are different things.
	The expiation for the first is to adopt the right course, and for
	the second the same as has been laid down in the Qur'an. For further

	verse enunciates a fundamental principle: Impure men are a fit match
	for impure women and pious men are a fit match for pious women. It
	never happens that a man is good in all other aspects but is
	addicted to a solitary vice. As a matter of fact, his very habits,
	manners and demeanor, all contain a number of evil traits, which
	sustain and nourish that single vice. It is impossible that a man
	develops a vice all of a sudden without having any trace of its
	existence in his demeanor and way of life. This is a psychological
	truth which everybody experiences in the daily lives of the people.
	How is it then possible that a man who has all along lived a pure
	and morally clean life, will put up and continue to live for years
	in love with a wife who is adulterous? Can a woman be imagined who
	is an adulteress, but she does not manifest her evil character
	through her talk, gait, manners and deportment? Is it possible for a
	virtuous man of high character to live happily with a woman of this
	type? What is being suggested here is that people in future should
	not credulously put their belief in any rumor that reaches them.
	They should carefully see as to who is being accused and on what
	account and whether the accusation fairly sticks on the person or
	not. And when there exists no trace of evidence to support the
	accusation, people cannot believe it just because a foolish or
	wicked person has uttered it.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some

	are for the evil people and good things for the good people: the
	good people are free from the evil things which the wicked people
	utter about them. Some others have interpreted it to mean that evil
	deeds only go with evil people and good deeds with good people: the
	pious people are free from the evil deeds which the wicked people
	ascribe to them. Still others interpret it to mean that evil and
	filthy talk is indulged in only by the evil and filthy people and
	good and pious talk only by the good and pious people: the pious
	people are free from the sort of talk that these mischievous' people
	are indulging in. The words of the verse are comprehensive and can
	be interpreted in any of the three ways, but the first meaning that

	creation and spread of evil. Before we study these Commandments, it
	will be useful to understand two things clearly: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	the revelation of these Commandments immediately after the Divine
	appraisal of the incident of the &quot;slander&quot; clearly
	indicates that permeation of a calumny against the noble person of a
	wife of the Holy Prophet in the society, was the direct result of
	the existence of a sexually charged atmosphere, and in the sight of
	Allah there was no other way of cleansing society of the evil than
	of prohibiting free entry into other people's houses, discouraging
	free mixing of the sexes together, forbidding women to appear in
	their make up before the other men, excepting a small circle of
	close relatives, banning prostitution, exhorting men and women not ,
	to remain unmarried for long, and arranging marriages even of the
	slaves and slave-girls. In other words, the movement of the women
	without purdah and the presence of a large number of unmarried
	persons in society were, in the knowledge of Allah, the real causes
	that imperceptibly give rise to sensuality in society. It was this
	sexually charged atmosphere which kept the ears, eyes, tongues and
	hearts of the people ever ready to get involved in any real or
	fictitious scandal. Allah in His wisdom did not regard any other
	measure more suitable and effective than these Commandments to
	eradicate this evil; otherwise He would have enjoined some other
	Commandments. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The.
	second important thing to remember is that Divine Law does not
	merely forbid an evil or only prescribe a punishment for the
	offender, but it also puts an end to all those factors which provide
	occasions for the evil, or incite or force a person to commit it. It
	also imposes curbs on the causes, incentives and means leading to
	the evil so as to check the wrongdoer much before he actually
	commits the crime. It does not like that people should freely
	approach and loiter about near the border lines of sin and get
	caught and punished all the time. It does not merely act as a
	prosecutor but as a guide, reformer and helper, too. So it uses all
	kinds of moral, social and educational devices to help the people to
	safeguard themselves against evil and vice.&nbsp;

	from the root uns, meaning fondness, affection, regard, etc.
	According to this, the verse would mean: &quot;Do not enter other

	morning' or `good evening'. This unannounced entry sometimes
	violated the privacy of the people and their women folk. Allah
	enjoined the principle that everybody has a right to privacy in his
	own house and no one is entitled to force his entry unannounced and
	without permission of the inmates. The rules and regulations
	enforced by the Holy Prophet in society on receipt of the above
	Commandment are given below serially: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) The
	'right of privacy' was not merely confined to the question of entry
	in the houses, but it was declared as a common right according to
	which it is forbidden to peep into a house, glance from outside, or
	even read the other person's letter without his permission.
	According to Thauban, who was a freed slave of the Holy Prophet, the
	Holy Prophet said: &quot;When you have already cast a look into a
	house, what is then the sense in seeking permission for entry?&quot;
	(Abu Da`ud). Hadrat Huzail bin Shurahbil has reported that a man
	came to see the Holy Prophet and sought permission for entry while
	standing just in front of the door. The Holy Prophet said to him:
	&quot;Stand aside: the object of the Commandment for seeking
	permission is to prevent casting of looks inside the house.&quot;
	(Abu Da'ud). The practice of the Holy Prophet was that whenever he
	went to see somebody, he would stand aside, to the right or the left
	of the door, and seek permission as it was not then usual to hang
	curtains on the doors. (Abu Da'ud). Hadrat Anas, the attendant of
	the Holy Prophet, states that a man glanced into the room of the
	Holy Prophet from outside. The Holy Prophet at that time was holding
	an arrow in his hand. He advanced towards the man in a way as if he
	would thrust the arrow into his belly. (Abu Da'ud). According to
	Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Whoever
	glances through the letter of his brother without his permission,
	glances into fire.&quot; (Abu Da'ud). According to Muslim and
	Bukhari;, the Holy Prophet is reported to have said: &quot;If
	someone peeps into your house, it will be no sin if you injure his
	eye with a piece of stone.&quot; In another Tradition, he has said:
	&quot;The inmates of a house, who injure the eye of the man peeping
	into their house; are not liable to any punishment.&quot; Imam
	Shafi`I has taken this Commandment literally and permits smashing of
	the eye of the one who casts a glance like this. The Hanafis,
	however, do not take the Command in the literal sense. They express
	the opinion that it is applicable only in that case where an
	outsider forces his entry into a house in spite of the resistance
	from the inmates and has his eye or some other limb smashed in the
	scuffle. In such a case, no penalty will lie on the inmates.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2) The
	jurists have included `hearing' also under `glancing'. For instance,
	if a blind man enters a house without permission, he will not be
	able to see anybody, but he will certainly be able to hear whatever
	is going on in the house. This also amounts to violation of the
	other person's right of privacy. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) The
	Command to seek permission is not only applicable in cases where a
	person wants to enter the other people's houses, but it also applies
	to entry in the house of_ one's own mother or sister. A man asked
	the Holy Prophet: &quot;Sir, should I seek permission to enter my
	mother's house also?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied that he should.
	The man stated that there was nobody beside him to look after her,
	and asked whether it was necessary to get permission every time he
	wanted to go in. The Holy Prophet replied: &quot;Yes; would you like
	that you should see your mother in a naked state&quot; (Ibn Jarir
	quoting from `Ata bin Yasar). According to a saying of `Abdullah bin
	Mas`ud, one should seek permission even when going to see one's own
	mother or sister. (Ibn Kathir). He has suggested that even when a
	person goes to visit one's wife in one's own house, he should
	announce his arrival by coughing, etc. It is related by his wife
	Zainab that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud would always announce his arrival
	by coughing, etc. and never liked that he should enter the house
	unannounced all of a sudden. (Ibn Jarir). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	only exception to the general rule is that no permission is needed
	in case of an emergency or a calamity like theft, fire, etc. One can
	go for help without permission in such cases. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(5) In
	the beginning when the system of seeking permission was introduced,
	people did not know the exact procedure to be followed. Once a man
	came to the Prophet's house and shouted at the door, &quot;Should I
	be in?&quot; The Holy Prophet said to his maid servant, Roudah, &quot;Go
	and instruct him about the correct way. He should say: Assalam-o-
	`alaikum (peace be upon you): May I come in?&quot; (Ibn Jarir, Abu
	Da'ud). Jabir bin `Abdullah says that once he went to the Holy
	Prophet's house in connection with certain liabilities of his father
	and knocked at the door. The Holy Prophet asked: &quot;Who is it?&quot;
	I replied, &quot;It's me.&quot; The Holy Prophet thereupon repeated
	twice or thrice: &quot;It's me, it's me!&quot; That is, how can one
	understand from this who you are? (Abu Da'ud). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">A man
	named Kaladah bin Hanbal went to see the Holy Prophet and got seated
	without the customary salutation. The Holy Prophet told him to go
	out and come in again after calling: Assalam-o-`alaikum (peace be
	upon you). (Abu Da'ud). Thus, the correct method of seeking
	permission was to disclose one's identity first and then ask for
	permission. It is related that whenever Hadrat `Umar went to see the
	Holy Prophet, he would say: &quot;Assalam-o- alaikum ya Rasul-Allah,
	I am `Umar: May I enter!&quot; (Abu Da'ud). The Holy Prophet
	enjoined that permission should be asked thrice at the most. If
	there is no reply even at the third call, one should come back.
	(Bukhari, Muslim, Abu D'ud). The same was his own practice. Once he
	went to the house of Hadrat Sa'd bin `Ubadah and sought permission
	twice after greeting with: Assalam-o-`alaikum wa Rahmatullah (peace
	be upon you and mercy of Allah), but there was no response. After
	calling for the third time when he received no response, he turned
	back. Sa'd came out running from the house, and said, &quot;O
	Messenger of Allah, I was hearing you all right, but I desired to
	have Allah's peace and mercy invoked upon me through your sacred
	tongue as often as possible; therefore, I was replying to you in a
	low voice. &quot; (Abu D'ud, Ahmad). The three calls as enjoined
	above should not be made in quick succession, but at suitable
	intervals so as to allow sufficient time to the inmates to make the
	response in case they are not free to do so. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(6) The
	permission for entry should come from the master of the house
	himself or from some other reliable inmate like a servant or a

	One should not enter the house on the word of a mere child.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(7) Undue
	insistence for permission to enter or to keep standing at the door
	obstinately even after refusal, is not permissible. If no entry is

	should go back.

	Holy Prophet are given below: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) It is
	not lawful for a tnan to cast a full gaze at the other women except
	at his own wife or the mahram women of his family. The chance look
	is pardonable but not the second look which one casts when one feels
	the lure of the object. The Holy Prophet has termed such gazing and
	glancing as wickedness of the eyes. He has said that man commits
	adultery with all his sensory organs. The evil look at the other
	woman is the adultery of the eyes; lustful talk is the adultery of
	the tongue; relishing the other woman's voice is adultery of the
	ears; and touching her body with the hand or walking for an unlawful
	purpose is adultery of the hands and feet. After these preliminaries
	the sexual organs either bring the act of adultery to completion or
	leave it incomplete. (Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to a Tradition related by Hadrat Buraidah, the Holy Prophet
	instructed Hadrat 'Ali: &quot;O 'Ali, do not cast a second look
	after the first look. The first look is pardonable but not the
	second one.&quot; (Tirmizi;, Ahmad, Abu Da'ud). Hadrat Jarir bin
	'Abdullah Bajali says that he asked the Holy Prophet, &quot;What
	should I do if I happen to cast a chance look?&quot; The Holy
	Prophet replied, &quot;Turn your eyes away or lower your
	gaze.&quot;(Muslim, Ahmad, Tirmizi, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i). Hadrat
	'Abdullah bin Mas'ud quotes the Holy Prophet as having said: &quot;Allah
	says that the gaze is one of the poisonous arrows of Satan. Whoever
	forsakes it, out of His fear, he will be rewarded with a faith whose
	sweetness he will relish in his own heart.&quot; (Tabarani).
	According to a Tradition related by Abu Umamah, the Holy Prophet
	said: &quot;If a Muslim happens to glance at the charms of a woman
	and then turns his eyes away, Allah will bless his worship and
	devotion and will make it all the more sweet. ''. (Musnad Ahmad).
	Imam Ja'far Sadiq has quoted from his father, Imam Muhammad Baqir,
	who has quoted Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah Ansari as saying: &quot;On
	the occasion of the Farewell Pilgrimage, Fadal bin'Abbas, who was a
	young cousin of the Holy Prophet, was riding with him on the
	camelback during the return journey from Mash`ar al-Haram. When they
	came to a few women passing on the way, Fadal started looking at
	them. Thereupon the Holy Prophet put his hand on his face and turned
	it to the other side.&quot; (Abu Da'ud). On another occasion during
	the same Pilgrimage, a woman of the clan of Khath'am stopped the
	Holy Prophet on the way and sought clarification about a certain
	matter pertaining to Hajj. Fadal bin `Abbas fixed his gaze at her,
	but the Holy Prophet turned his face to the other side. (Bukhari,
	Abu Da'ud, Tirmizi). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(2)
	Nobody should have the misunderstanding that the Command to restrain
	the 'gaze was enjoined because the women were allowed to move about
	freely with open faces, for if veiling of the face had already been
	enjoined, the question of restraining or not restraining the gaze
	would not have arisen. This argument is incorrect rationally as well
	as factually. It is incorrect rationally because even when veiling
	of the face is the usual custom, occasions can arise where a man and
	a woman come face to face with each other suddenly, or when a veiled
	woman has to uncover her face under necessity. Then even if the
	Muslim women observe purdah, there will be non-Muslim women who will
	continue to move about unveiled. Thus, the Commandment to lower the
	gaze or restrain the eyes, does not necessarily presume existence of
	a custom allowing the women to move about with unveiled faces. It is
	incorrect factually because the custom of purdah which was
	introduced after the revelation of the Commandments in Surah
	Al-Ahzab included veiling of the face, and this is supported by a
	number of Traditions relating to the time of the Holy Prophet
	himself. Hadrat `A'ishah in her statement relating to the incident
	of the &quot;slander&quot;, which has been narrated on the authority
	of reliable reporters, has said: &quot;When I came back to the camp,
	and found that the caravan had left, I lay down and was '
	overpowered by sleep. In the morning when Safwan bin Mu`attal passed
	that way he recognised me because he had seen me before the
	Commandment of purdah had been sent down. On recognising me he
	exclaimed: Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji`un: `To Allah we belong
	and to Him we shall return'; and I awoke and covered my face with my
	sheet.&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Hisham). Abu
	Da'ud contains an incident that when the son of Umm Khallad was
	killed in a battle, she came to the Holy Prophet to enquire about
	him and was wearing the veil as usual. It was natural to presume
	that on such a sad occasion one is liable to lose one's balance and
	ignore the restrictions of purdah. But when questioned she said, &quot;I
	have certainly lost my son but not my modesty.&quot; Another
	Tradition in Abu Da'ud quoted on the authority of Hadrat `A'ishah
	relates that a woman handed an application to the Holy Prophet from
	behind a curtain. The Holy Prophet enquired: &quot;Is it a man's
	hand or a woman's?&quot; She replied that it was a woman's.
	Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: &quot;If it is a woman's hand, the
	nails at least should have been coloured with henna!&quot; As
	regards the two incidents relating to the occasion of Hajj, which we
	have mentioned above, they cannot be used as an argument to prove
	that the veil was not in vogue in the time of the Holy Prophet. This
	is because wearing of the veil is prohibited in the state of ihram.
	However, even in that state pious women did not like to uncover
	their faces before the other men. Hadrat `A'ishah has stated that
	during the Farewell Pilgrimage when they were moving towards Makkah
	in the state of ihram, the women would lower down their head sheets
	over their faces whenever the travellers passed by them, and would
	uncover their faces as soon as they had passed by. (Abu Da'ud). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(3) There
	are certain exceptions to the Command of lowering the gaze or
	restraining the look. These exceptions relate to occasions when it
	is really necessary to see a woman, for instance, when a man intends
	to marry her. It is not only permissible to see the woman in such a
	case but even commendable. Mughirah bin Shu'bah has stated,. &quot;I
	wanted to marry in a certain family. The Holy Prophet asked me
	whether I had seen the girl or not. When 1 replied in the negative,
	he said: `Have a look at her; this will enhance harmonious
	relationship between you two'.&quot; (Ahmad, Tirmizi, Nasa'i, Ibn
	Majah, Darimi). According to a Tradition related by Abu Hurairah, a
	man wanted to marry in a family of the Ansar. The Holy Prophet asked
	him to have a look at the girl, for the Ansar usually had a defect
	in their eyes. (Muslim, Nasa'i, Ahmad). According to Jabir bin
	'Abdullah, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;When a person from among you
	wants to marry a woman, he should have a look at her to satisfy
	himself that there is some quality in the woman which induces him to
	marry her. &quot; (Ahmad, Abu Da'ud). According to another Tradition
	emanating from Abu Humaidah and quoted in Musnad Ahmad, the Holy
	Prophet said that there was no harm in such a procedure. He also
	permitted that the girl may be seen without her being aware of it.
	From this the jurists have concluded that there is no harm in
	looking at a woman when it is really necessary. For instance, there
	is no harm in looking at a suspect woman when investigating a crime,
	or in the judge's looking at a female witness, who appears in the
	court, or in the physician's looking at a female patient, etc. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(4) The
	intention of the Command to restrain the gaze also implies that no
	man or woman should look at the private parts of the other man or
	woman. The Holy Prophet has said: &quot;No man should look at the
	satar of another man nor a woman at the sater of another woman.&quot;
	(Ahmad, Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Tirmizi). Hadrat 'Ali has quoted the Holy
	Prophet as saying: &quot;Do not look at the thigh of another person,
	living or dead&quot;. (Abu Da'ud, Ibn Majah). &nbsp;

	their private parts&quot;: Abstain from illicit sexual gratification
	and from exposing their satar before others. For males, the satar is
	the part of the body from the navel to the knee, and it is not
	permissible to expose that pan of the body intentionally before
	anybody except one's own wife. (Daraqutni, Baihaqi). Hadrat Jarhad
	Aslami states that once he was sitting in the company of the Holy
	Prophet with his thigh exposed. The Holy Prophet said: &quot;Do you
	not know that the thigh has to be kept concealed.&quot; (Tirmizi,
	Abu Da'ud, Mu'atta). Hadrat 'AIi reports that the Holy Prophet said:
	&quot;Do not expose your thigh.&quot; (Abu Da'ud, Ibn Majah). Not
	only is the satar to be kept concealed before others but even when
	alone. The Holy Prophet has warned: &quot;Beware, never remain
	naked, for with you are those (that is, the angels of goodness and
	mercy), who never leave you alone except when you ease yourself or
	you go to your wives. So feel shy of them and give them due respect.
	&quot; (Tirmizi). According to another Tradition, the Holy Prophet
	said: &quot;Guard your satar from everybody except from your wife
	and your slave-girl.&quot; The questioner asked, &quot;Even when we
	are alone?&quot; The Holy Prophet replied, &quot;Yes, even when
	alone, for Allah has a greater right that you should feel shy of
	Him.&quot; (Abu Da'ud, Tirmizi, Ibn Majah).

<DIV ID="sdfootnote32">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote32sym" HREF="#sdfootnote32anc">31</A>The
	Commandments of restraining the gaze for women are the same as for
	men. They should not glance intentionally at the other men, and if
	they happen to cast a chance look, they should turn their eyes away;
	and they should abstain from looking at the satar of others.
	However, the Commandments relating to the men's looking at women are
	a little different from those relating to the women's looking at
	men. On the one hand, there is an incident related in a Tradition
	saying that Hadrat Umm Salamah and Hadrat Umm Maimunah, wives of the
	Holy Prophet, were sitting with him when lbn Umm Maktum, a blind
	Companion, made his appearance. The Holy Prophet said to his wives:
	&quot;Conceal your faces from him.&quot; The wives said, &quot;O
	Messenger of Allah: Is he not a blind man '? Neither will he see us
	nor recognize us.&quot; Thereupon the Holy Prophet remarked: &quot;Are
	you two also blind? Do you not see him?&quot; Hadrat Umm Salamah has
	clarified that this incident occurred at a time when the
	Commandments about the observance of purdah had already been sent
	down. (Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Tirmizi. This is also supported by a
	Tradition in Mu'atta saying that a blind man came to see Hadrat
	'A'ishah and she observed purdah from him. When asked as to why she
	observed purdah when the man could not see her, she replied: &quot;But
	I do see him.&quot; On the other hand, there is a different
	Tradition from Hadrat `A'ishah. In 7 A.H. a deputation of the
	Africans came to Al-Madinah and they gave a performance of physical
	skill in the compound of the Prophet's Mosque. The Holy Prophet
	himself showed their performance to Hadrat 'A'ishah. (Bukhari,
	Muslim, Ahmad). In another case, we find that when Fatimah bint Qais
	was irrevocably divorced by her husband, the question arose as to
	where she should pass her 'Iddah (the prescribed waiting term after
	divorce or death of husband). The Holy Prophet first told her to
	stay with Umm Sharik Ansari, but then instructed her to stay in the
	house of Ibn Umm Maktum, where she could stay with greater freedom
	as he was a blind man. He did not approve of her staying in the
	house of Umm Shank because she was a rich lady and her house was
	frequented by the Companions whom she entertained generously.
	(Muslim, Abu Da'ud). Read together these Traditions show that the
	restrictions about the women's looking at melt are not so hard as
	about the men's looking at women. While it is forbidden for women to
	sit face to face with men, it is not unlawful if they cast a look at
	men while passing on the way or see a harmless performance by them
	from a distance. There is also no hams for women to see the other
	men in case of real need if they are living in the same house. Imam
	Ghazzali; and lbn Hajar `Asqalani have also reached almost the same
	conclusion. Shaukani in his Nail al-Autar has quoted Ibn Hajar as
	saying: &quot;Such a permission in respect of women is also
	supported by the fact that they have always enjoyed this type of
	freedom in outdoor duties While they came out veiled when visiting
	the mosques, or moving in the streets, or during the journey, so
	that men may not gaze at them, the men were never commanded to use
	the veil so that women may not gaze at them. This shows that the
	Commandments in respect of the two sexes are different.&quot; (Vol.
	Vl, p. 101). However, it is not at all permissible that women should
	gaze leisurely at men and draw pleasure of the eye in doing so.

	reveal the skin or the outlines of the body. According to a
	Tradition from Hadrat 'A'ishah, orate her sister Asma' came before
	the Holy Prophet in a thin dress. The Holy Prophet immediately
	turned his face away and said: &quot;O Asma', when a woman has
	attained her maturity, it is not permissible that any part of her
	body should be exposed except the face and the hand.&quot; (Abu

	visit. When the Holy Prophet (Allah's peace be upon him) entered the
	house, he saw her but turned his face to the other side. Hadrat
	`A'ishah said: &quot;O Messenger of Allah, she is my niece.&quot;
	Thereupon the Holy Prophet remarked: &quot;When a woman reaches the
	age of puberty, it is not lawful for her to display her body except
	the hand and the face. (Then he indicated what he meant by the hand
	by gripping his own hand from the wrist so that there was hardly a
	breadth left between his grip and the palm of the hand).&quot; The
	only relaxation permitted in this connection is that a woman can
	uncover only that much of her body before her close relatives (for
	example, her brother, father, etc.) as is absolutely necessary for
	attending to the household duties. For instance, she can roll up her

	`makeup' should not be displayed before others is discussed in
	detail in the following Notes.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote36">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote36sym" HREF="#sdfootnote36anc">35</A>Different
	interpretations given by different commentators of this verse have
	greatly confused its real meaning. All that is obviously meant is
	that &quot;women should not display their make-up and adornment&quot;
	except that &quot;which is displayed of itself&quot; and is beyond
	their control. This clearly means that women should not purposely
	and intentionally display their make-up, but there is no
	accountability if the make-up becomes displayed without any purpose
	or intention on their part; for instance, the head-wrapper's being
	blown aside by the wind thus exposing the adornment, ,or the
	outer-garment itself which cannot be concealed but which
	nevertheless has attraction being a part of the female dress. This
	very interpretation of this verse has been given by Hadrat `Abdullah
	bin Mas'ud, Hasan Basri, Ibn Sirin and Ibrahim Nakha`i. On the
	contrary, some other commentators have interpreted the verse to mean
	&quot;all those parts of the body which usually remain exposed or
	uncovered&quot; and in this they include the hands and the face with
	all their adornments. This is the view of Hadrat Ibn `Abbas and his
	followers, and a large number of the Hanafi jurists have accepted
	it. (Ahkam-ul-Qur'an, AlJassas, Vol. III, pp. 388-389). Thus,
	according to them, it is permissible for a woman to move out freely
	with the uncovered face in full make-up and adornment of the hands 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">We are,
	however, unable to subscribe to this view. There is a world of
	difference between &quot;displaying something&quot; and &quot;its
	becoming displayed of itself.&quot; The first implies `intention'
	and the second 'compulsion' and a state of helplessness. Moreover,
	such an interpretation also goes against the traditions which state
	that the women never moved out with open and uncovered faces in the
	time of the Holy Prophet after the Commandments of purdah had been
	sent down. These Commandments implied veiling of the face as well,
	and the veil had become a part of the female dress except during
	Hajj when one has to be in the prescribed state of ihram and keep
	the face uncovered. Another argument that is advanced in support of
	this view is that the hands and the face are not included in the
	satar of the woman, whereas satar and purdah are two entirely
	different things. Sanctity of satar is such that it cannot be
	violated even before the mahram males like the father. brother, etc.
	As for purdah it is over and above satar which is meant to segregate
	women from non mahram males; the discussion here relates to the
	Commandments of purdah and not to satar.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote37">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote37sym" HREF="#sdfootnote37anc">36</A>In
	the pre-lslamic days of ignorance, women used to wear a sort of
	head-band, which was tied in a knot at the rear of the head. The
	slit of the shirt in the front partly remained open exposing the
	front of the neck and the upper part of the bosom. There was nothing
	except the shirt to cover the breasts, and the hair was worn in a
	couple or two of plaits hanging behind like tails. (AI-Kashshaf,
	Vol. II, p. 90, and Ibn Kathir, Vol. III, pp. 283-284). At the
	revelation of this verse, the head-wrapper (dopatta) was introduced
	among the Muslim women, which was meant to cover the head, the
	breasts, and the back, completely. The way the Muslim women
	responded to this Command has been described by Hadrat 'A'ishah in a
	vivid manner. She states that when Surah An-Nur was revealed and the
	people learned of its contents from the Holy Prophet, they
	immediately went back to their houses and recited the verses before
	their wives, daughters and sisters. There was an instantaneous
	response. The Ansar women, one and all, immediately got up and made
	wrappers from whatever piece of cloth that was handy. The next
	morning all the women who came to the Prophet's Mosque for prayers
	were dressed in wrappers. In another tradition Hadrat `A'ishah says
	that thin cloth was discarded and the women selected only coarse
	cloth for the purpose. (lbn Kathir, Vol.III, p. 284, Abu Da'ud).</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The very
	nature and object of the Command demanded that the wrapper should
	not be made out of fine and thin cloth. The Ansar women immediately
	understood the real object and knew what type of cloth was intended
	to be used. The Law-Giver himself clarified this and did not leave
	it to be interpreted by the people. Dihya Kalbi states: &quot;Once a
	length of fine Egyptian muslin was presented to the Holy Prophet. He
	gave a piece of it to me and said, `Use one part of it for your
	shirt, and give the rest of it to your wife for a wrapper, but tell
	her that she should stitch another piece of cloth on the inner side
	so that the body may not be displayed through it.&quot; (Abu Da'ud).</P>

	the relatives the other people are now being mentioned. But before
	we proceed further, it would be useful to understand three things in
	order to avoid confusion. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First,
	some jurists hold that the freedom of movement and display of
	adornment by a woman is restricted to the circle of relatives
	mentioned in this verse. AII others, even the real paternal and
	maternal uncles, are excluded from this list and a woman should
	observe purdah from them because they have not been mentioned in the
	Qur'an. This is, however, not a correct view. Let alone the real
	uncles, the Holy Prophet disallowed Hadrat `A'ishah to observe
	purdah even from her foster uncles. A tradition quoted in Sihah
	Sitta' and Musnad Ahmad on the authority of Hadrat `A'ishah says
	that once Aflah, brother of Abul Qu'ais, came to see her and sought
	permission to enter the house. But since the Commandment of purdah
	had been received, Hadrat `A'ishah refused him permission. On this
	Aflah sent back the word saying, &quot;You are my niece: you were
	suckled by my brother Abul Qu'ais's wife.&quot; But Hadrat `A'ishah
	still was hesitant whether it was permissible to appear unveiled
	before such a relative or not. In the meantime the Holy Prophet
	arrived and he ruled that he could see her. This shows that the Holy
	Prophet himself did not interpret the verse in the way these jurists
	do that it was lawful to appear unveiled only before those relatives
	who have been mentioned in the verse and not before others. He
	interpreted it to mean that purdah need not be observed from those
	relatives with whom marriage is prohibited, for instance, paternal
	and maternal uncles, son-in-law and foster relatives. Hadrat Hasan
	Basri from among the followers has expressed the same opinion and
	the same has been supported by `Allama Abu Bakr al-Jassas in his
	Ahkam-ul-Qur an. (Vol. III, p. 390). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	there is the question of those relatives with whom marriage is not
	permanently prohibited; they neither fall in the category of mahram
	relatives (that women may freely appear before them with adornment)
	nor in the category of complete strangers that they should observe
	full purdah from them as from others. What should be the right
	course between the two extremes has not been determined by the Shari
	`ah for such a course cannot possibly be determined. The observance
	of purdah or otherwise in such cases will inevitably depend on the
	mutual relationship, age of the woman and of men, family relations
	and contacts and other circumstances (e.g. residence in the same
	house or in different houses). The personal example of the Holy
	Prophet himself in this matter gives us the same guidance. A large
	number of traditions confirm that Hadrat Asma', daughter of Abu
	Bakr, who was a sister-in-law of the Holy Prophet, appeared unveiled
	before him and no purdah, at least of the face and hands, was
	observed by her. This same position continued till the Farewell
	Pilgrimage which took place just a few months before the death of
	the Holy Prophet. (Abu Da'ud). Similarly Hadrat Umm Hani, daughter
	of Abu Talib and a first cousin of the Holy Prophet, appeared before
	him till the end without ever observing purdah of the face and
	hands. She herself has narrated an incident pertaining to the
	conquesh of Makkah, which confirms the same. (Abu Da'ud).On the
	contrary, we see that Hadrat `Abbas sends his son Fadal, and Rabi'ah
	bin Harith bin `Abdul Muttalib (a first cousin of the Holy Prophet)
	his son 'Abdul Muttalib before the Holy Prophet with the request for
	a job, as they could not be married till they became earning members
	of the family. They both see the Holy Prophet in the house of his
	wife Zainab, who is a first cousin of Fadal and is similarly related
	to the father of 'Abdul Muttalib bin Rabi'ah. But she dces not
	appear before them and talks to them from behind a curtain in the
	presence of the Holy Prophet. (Abu Da'ud). Taking the two kinds of
	precedents together we come to the same conclusion as we have stated
	above. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly,
	in cases where the relationship itself becomes doubtful, purdah
	should be observed even from the mahram relatives. Bukhari, Muslim
	and Abu Da'ud have related a case where Saudah, a wife of the Holy
	Prophet, had a brother born of a slave woman. `Utbah, the father of
	Saudah and the boy, left a will enjoining his brother, Sa`d bin Abi
	Waqqas, to look after the boy as a nephew for he was from his own
	seed. When the case came before the Holy Prophet, he rejected the
	claim of Hadrat Sa 'd, saying: &quot;The boy belongs to him on whose
	bed he was born; as for the adulterer, let stones and pebbles be his
	lot.&quot; But at the same time he told Hadrat Saudah to observe
	purdah from the boy because it was doubtful whether he was really
	her brother.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote44">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote44sym" HREF="#sdfootnote44anc">43</A>The
	Arabic word nisa-i -hinna means &quot;their female associates&quot;.
	Before we consider what women are exactly meant, it is worth noting
	that the word used here is not an-nisa, which merely means &quot;women&quot;,
	but nisa i-hinna which means &quot;their female associates&quot;. In
	the former case, it would be quite permissible for a Muslim woman to
	appear unveiled before all sorts of women and display her adornment.
	The use of nisa-i-hinna, however, has circumscribed her freedom
	within a specific circle. As to what specific circle of women is
	implied, the commentators and jurists have expressed different
	opinions. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">According
	to one group, the &quot;female associates&quot; mean only the Muslim
	women; as for the non-Muslim women, whether zimmis or otherwise,
	they are excluded and purdah should be observed from them as from
	men. Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and Ibn Juraij hold this opinion and cite
	the following incident in support thereof: Caliph `Umar wrote to
	Hadrat Abu `Ubaidah: &quot;I hear that some Muslim women have
	started going to public baths along with the non-Muslim women. It is
	not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day
	that she should expose her body before the women other than of her
	own community.&quot; On receipt of this letter Hadrat Abu `Ubaidah
	was much upset, and he cried out: &quot;May the face of the woman
	who goes to the public baths to whiten her complexion be blackened
	on the Last Day!&quot; (Ibn Jarir, Baihaqi, Ibn Kathir). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	group, which includes Imam Razi, is of the view that &quot;female
	associates&quot; are all women without exception. But it is not
	possible to accept this view as in that case an-nisa should have
	sufficed and there was no need to use nisa-i-hinna. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	opinion, and this appears to be reasonable and nearer the Qur'anic
	Text, is that &quot;their female associates&quot; mean those
	familiar and known women with whom a woman usually comes into
	contact in her daily life and who share in her household chores,
	etc. whether they are Muslim or non-Muslim. The object here is to
	exclude those women from the circle who are either strangers whose
	cultural and moral background is not known or whose antecedents are
	apparently doubtful, which make them unreliable. This view is also
	supported by the authentic Traditions which state that zimmi women
	used to visit the wives of the Holy Prophet. The real thing to be
	considered in this connection would be the moral character and not
	the religious belief. Muslim women can meet and have intimate social
	contacts with noble, modest and virtuous women, who come from
	well-known and reliable families even if they are non-Muslim. But
	they must observe purdah from immodest, immoral and vulgar women
	even if they happen to be &quot;Muslims&quot;. Their company from
	the moral viewpoint is as dangerous as of other men. As for contacts
	with un-known, unfamiliar women, they may at the most be treated
	like non-mahram relatives. A woman may uncover her face and hands
	before them but she must keep the rest of her body and adornments
	concealed.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote45">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote45sym" HREF="#sdfootnote45anc">44</A>There
	is a good deal of difference of opinion among the jurists about the
	correct meaning of this injunction. One group holds that this refers
	only to the slave girls owned by a lady. Accordingly they interpret
	the Divine Command to mean that the Muslim woman can display her
	adornment before a slave girl, whether she is an idolatress or a Jew
	or a Christian, but she cannot appear before a slave man even if he
	is legally owned by her; for purposes of purdah, he is to be treated
	just like a free male stranger. This is the view of `Abdullah bin
	Mas`ud, Mujahid, Hasan Basri, Ibn Sirin, Said bin Musayyab, Ta`us
	and Imam Abu Hanifah, and a saying of Imam Shafi`i also supports
	this. They argue that the slave is not a mahram to the lady; if he
	is freed, e can marry his former owner. Therefore the there fact of
	his being a slave cannot by itself entitle him to be treated like
	the male mahrams and allow the lady to appear freely before him. The
	question why should the words&quot; those in their possession&quot;
	which are general and applicable to both slaves and slave girls, be
	restricted to mean only slave girls, is answered by these jurists
	like this: Though the words are general, the context and background
	in which they occur snake them specifically applicable to slave
	girls only. The , words &quot;those in their possession&quot; occur
	just after &quot;their female associates&quot; in the verse;
	therefore one could understand that the reference was to a woman's
	relatives and other associates; this could lead to the
	misunderstanding that the slave girls perhaps were excluded; the
	words &quot;those in their possession&quot;. therefore were used to
	clarify that a woman could display her adornments before the slave
	girls as before her free female associates. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	group holds that the words &quot;those in their possession&quot;
	include both the slaves and the slave girls. This is the view of
	Hadrat `A'ishah, Umm Salamah and some learned scholars of the house
	of the Holy Prophet and also of Imam Shafi`i. They do not argue
	merely on the basis of the general meaning of the words, but they
	also cite precedents from the Sunnah in support of their view. For
	instance, the incident that the Holy Prophet went to the house of
	his daughter, Hadrat Fatimah, along with his slave 'Abdullah bin
	Musa'dah al-Fazari. She was at that time wearing a sheet which would
	leave the feet exposed if she tried to cover the head, and the head
	exposed if she tried to cover the feet. The Holy Prophet felt her
	embarrassment and said: &quot;No harm: there are only your father
	and your slave!&quot; (Abu Da'ud, Ahmad, Baihaqi on the authority of
	Anas bin Malik). Ibn 'Asakir has stated that the Holy Prophet had
	given that slave to Hadrat Fatimah, who brought him up and then
	freed him. (But the man turned out to be an ungrateful wretch; in
	the battle of Siffin, he was the bitterest opponent of Hadrat 'Ali
	and a zealous supporter of Amir Mu`awiyah). They also quote the
	following words of the Holy Prophet in support of their stand: &quot;When
	any of you agrees to a deed of emancipation with her slave, and the
	slave has the necessary means to buy his freedom, she (the owner)
	should observe purdah from him.&quot; (Abu Da'ud, Tirmizi, Ibn Majah
	on the authority of Umm Salamah). &nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote46">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote46sym" HREF="#sdfootnote46anc">45</A>The
	literal translation of the Text would be: &quot;those from among the
	men who are your subordinates and have no desire.&quot; The obvious
	meaning is that apart from the mahram males, a Muslim woman can
	display her adornment only before the man who satisfies two
	conditions: firstly, he should be in a subordinate capacity, and
	secondly, he should be free from sexual urges either due to advanced
	age, impotence, mental weakness, poverty or low social position, so
	that he cannot cherish the desire or have the boldness to think
	evilly of his master's wife, daughter, sister or mother. Anybody who
	studies this injunction in the right spirit with a view to obeying
	it, and not for the sake of finding ways and means of escaping from
	or violating it, will readily appreciate that the bearers, cooks,
	chauffeurs and other grown up servants employed these days in the
	houses do not fall in this category. The following clarifications
	given by the commentators and the jurists of this point would show
	the type of men envisaged in the verse: Ibn 'Abbas: This implies a
	man who is a mere simpleton and has no interest in women. Qatadah: A
	poor man who is attached to you merely for his sustenance. Mujahid:
	A fool who only needs food and has no desire for women. Sha'bi: The
	one who is a subordinate; entirely dependent on his master, and
	cannot have the boldness to cast an evil look at the womenfolk of
	the house. lbn Zaid: The one who remains attached to a family for
	such a long time that he is regarded as a member brought up in that
	house, and who has no desire for the women of the house. He is there
	merely because he gets his sustenance from the family. Ta'us &amp;
	Zuhri: An idiot who dces not cherish the desire for the women nor
	has the courage to do so. (Ibn Jarir, Vol. XVIII, pp. 95-96, Ibn
	Kathir, Vol. III, p. 285). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The best
	explanation in this regard is the incident that happened in the time
	of the Holy Prophet, which has been quoted by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu
	Da'ud, Nasa'i and Ahmad on the authority of Hadrat `A'ishah and Umm
	Salamah. There was a certain eunuch in Madinah who was allowed free
	access to the wives of the Holy Prophet and the other women of the
	city, on the assumption that he being incapable of sex was free from
	the sexual urge. One day when the Holy Prophet went to the house of
	his wife, Umm Salamah, he heard him talking to her brother,
	'Abdullah bin Abi Umayyah. He was telling `Abdullah that if Taif was
	taken the following day, he should try to have Badia, daughter of
	Ghailan Thaqafi . And then he started praising Badia's beauty and
	her physical charms and even went to the extent of describing her
	private parts. On hearing this the Holy Prophet said: &quot;O enemy
	of Allah! you seem to have seen her through.&quot; Then he ordered
	that the women should observe purdah from him and he should not be
	allowed to enter the houses in future. After this he turned him out
	of Madinah and forbade the other eunuchs also to enter the houses,
	because the women did not mind their presence, while they would
	describe the women of one house before the other men of other houses
	in the society. This shows that the word &quot;incapable of sex
	desire&quot; do not merely imply physical impotence. Anyone who is
	physically unfit but cherishes sex desire in the heart and takes
	interest in women, can become the cause of many mischiefs.

<DIV ID="sdfootnote48">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote48sym" HREF="#sdfootnote48anc">47</A>The
	Holy Prophet did not restrict this injunction to the jingle of the
	ornaments, but has derived from it the principle that besides the
	look, anything which tends to excite any of the senses, is opposed
	to the objective for which Allah has forbidden the women to display
	their adornment. Therefore he ordered the women not to move out with
	perfumes. According to Hadrat Abu Hurairah, the Holy Prophet said:
	&quot;Do not stop the bondmaids of Allah from coming to the mosques,
	but. they should not come with perfumes.&quot; (Abu Da'ud, Ahmad).
	According to another tradition, Hadrat Abu Hurairah passed by a
	woman who was coming out of the mosque and felt that she had
	perfumed herself. He stopped her and said: &quot;O bondmaid of
	Allah, are you coming from the mosque?&quot; When she replied in the
	affirmative, he said: &quot;I have heard my beloved Abul Qasim
	(Allah's blessings and peace be upon him) say that the prayer of the
	woman who comes to the mosque with perfumes, is not accepted till
	she purifies herself with a complete bath as is done after a sexual
	intercourse.&quot; (Abu Da'ud, Ibn Majah, Ahmad, Nasa'i). Abu Musa
	Ash'ari has quoted the Holy Prophet as saying: &quot;A woman who
	passes on the way with perfumes so that people may enjoy her
	perfumes, is such and such: he used very harsh words for her.&quot;
	(Tirmizi, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i). His instruction was that women should
	use scents with bright colors but light odors. (Abu Da`ud).
	Similarly the Holy Prophet disapproved that feminine voices should
	enter the ears of men unnecessarily. In case of genuine need the
	Qur'an itself has allowed women to speak to men, and the Holy
	Prophet's wives themselves used to instruct people in religious
	matters. But where there is no necessity, nor any moral or religious
	objective, the women have been discouraged to let their voices be
	heard by men. Thus if the imam happens to commit a mistake during a
	congregational prayer, and he is to be warned of the lapse, the men
	have been taught to say Subhan-Allah (Glory be to Allah), while the
	women have been instructed to tap their hands only. (Bukhari,
	Muslim, Ahmad, Tirmizi, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah).</P>

	He prohibited the other men (even if they are relatives) to see a
	woman in privacy or sit with her in the absence of her mahram
	relatives. Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah has reported that the Holy
	Prophet said: &quot;Do not visit the women whose husbands are away
	from home, because Satan circulates in one of you like blood.&quot;
	(Tirmizi). According to another Tradition from Hadrat Jabir, the
	Holy Prophet said: &quot;Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day
	should never visit a woman when alone unless she has a mahram
	relative also present, because the third one would be Satan. &quot;
	(Ahmad). Imam Ahmad has quoted another Tradition from `Amir bin
	Rabi'ah to the same effect. The Holy Prophet himself was extremely
	cautious in this regard Once when he was accompanying his wife
	Hadrat Safiyyah to her Douse at night, two men of Ansar passed by
	them on the way. The Holy Prophet stopped them and said: &quot;The
	woman with me is my wife Safiyyah.&quot; They said: &quot;Glory be
	to Allah! O Messenger of AIlah, could there be any suspicion about
	you?&quot; The Holy Prophet said: &quot;Satan circulates like blood
	in the human body; I was afraid lest he should put an evil thought
	in your minds.&quot; (Abu Da'ud). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	The Holy Prophet did not approve that a man's hand should even touch
	the body of a non-mahram woman. That is why while administering the
	oath of allegiance, he would take the hand of the men into his own
	hand, but he never adopted this procedure in the case of women.
	Hadrat 'A'ishah has stated that the Holy Prophet never touched the
	body of any other woman. He would administer the oath verbally to
	them; when this was done, he would say: &quot;You may go, Your
	allegiance is complete.&quot; (Abu Da'ud). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	He strictly prohibited the woman from proceeding on a journey alone
	without a mahram or in company with a non-mahram. A Tradition from
	Ibn 'Abbas has been quoted in Bukhari and Muslim saying that the
	Holy Prophet gave a sermon and said: &quot;No man should visit the
	other woman when she is alone unless she has a mahram also present,
	and no woman should travel alone unless accompanied by a mahram. &quot;
	A man stood up and said:&quot;My wife is going for Hajj, while I am
	under orders to join a certain expedition.&quot; The Holy Prophet
	said: &quot;You may go for Hajj with your wife. &quot; Several other
	Traditions on the subject, emanating from Ibn 'Umar, Abu Said Khudri
	and Abu Hurairah, are found in authentic books of Traditions, which
	concur that it is not permissible for a Muslim woman who believes in
	Allah and the Last Day that she should go on a journey without a
	mahram. There is, however, a variation with regard to the duration
	and the length of the journey. Some Traditions lay down the minimum
	limit as 12 miles and some lay down the duration as one day, a day
	and night, two days or even three days. This variation, however,
	neither renders the Traditions unauthentic nor makes it necessary
	that we should accept one version as legally binding in preference
	to others. For a plausible explanation for the different versions
	could be that the Holy Prophet gave different instructions at
	different occasions depending on the circumstances and merit of each
	case. For instance, a woman going on a three-day journey might have
	been prohibited from proceeding without a mahram, while another
	going on a day's journey might also have been similarly prohibited.
	Here the real thing is not the different instructions to the
	different people in different situations, but the principle that a
	woman should not go on a journey without a mahram as laid down in
	the Tradition quoted above from lbn 'Abbas. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	He .not only took practical measures to stop free mixing of the
	sexes together but prohibited it verbally as well. Everyone knows
	the great importance of the congregational and the Friday prayers in
	Islam. The Friday Prayer has been made obligatory by AIIah Himself;
	the importance of the congregational prayer can be judged from a
	Tradition of the Holy Prophet, which says: &quot;If a person does
	not attend the mosque without a genuine reason and offers his prayer
	at home, it will not be acceptable to AIIah.&quot; (Abu Da'ud, Ibn
	Majah, Daraqutni, Hakim on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas).But in spite
	of this, the Holy Prophet exempted the women from compulsory
	attendance at the Friday Prayer. (Abu Da'ud, Daraqutni, Baihaqi). As
	for the other congregational prayers, he made the women's attendance
	optional, saying: &quot;Do not stop them if they want to come to the
	mosque.&quot; Then at the same time, he made the clarification that
	it was better forthem to pray in their houses than in the mosques.
	According to Ibn 'Umar and Abu Hurairah, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Do
	not prohibit the bondmaids of Allah from coming to the mosques of
	AIIah.&quot; (Abu Da'ud). Other Traditions from Ibn 'Umar are to the
	effect: &quot;Permit the women to come to themosques at night.&quot;
	(Bukhari, Muslim, Trimizi, Nasa'i, Abu Da'ud). And: &quot;Do not
	stop your women-folk from coming to the mosques though their houses
	are better for them than the mosques.&quot; (Ahmad, Abu Da'ud). Umm
	Humaid Sa'idiyyah states that once she said to the Holy Prophet, &quot;O
	Messenger of Allah, I have a great desire to offer my prayer under
	your leadership.&quot; He replied: &quot;Your offering the prayer in
	your room is better than your offering it in the verandah, and your
	offering the prayer in your house is better Bran your offering it in
	the neighbouring mosque, and your offering the prayer in the
	neighbouring mosque is better than offering it in the principal
	mosque (of the town).&quot; (Ahmad, Tabarani). A Tradition to the
	same effect has been reported from 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud in Abu
	Da'ud. According to Hadrat Umm Salamah, the Holy Prophet said: &quot;The
	best mosques for women are the innermost portions of their houses.&quot;
	(Ahmad, Tabarani). But when Hadrat 'A'ishah saw the conditions that
	prevailed in the time of the Umayyads, she said: &quot;If the Holy
	Prophet had witnessed such conduct of the women, he would certainly
	have stopped their entry into the mosques as was done in the case of
	the Israelite women,&quot; (Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud). The Holy
	Prophet had appointed a separate door in his Mosque for the entry of
	women, and Hadrat 'Umar in his time had given strict orders
	prohibiting men to use that door. (Abu Da'ud). In the congregational
	prayers the women were instructed to stand separately behind the
	men; at the conclusion of the prayer, the Holy Prophet and his
	followers used to remain sitting for a while so that the women could
	leave the mosque before the men. (Ahmad, Bukhari). The Holy Prophet
	would say: &quot;The best row for the men is the front row and the
	worst the last one (nearest to the women's row); and the best row
	for the women is the rearmost row And the worst the front one (just
	behind the men's). (Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Tirmizi Nasa'i, Ahmad). The
	women joined the 'Id congregational prayers but they had a separate
	enclosure from men. After the sermon the Holy Prophet used to
	address them separately (Abu Da'ud, Bukhari, Muslim). Once outside
	the Mosque the Holy Prophet saw the men and women moving side by
	side in the crowd. He stopped the women and said: It is not proper
	for you to walk in the middle of the road; walk on the sides.&quot;
	On hearing this the women immediately started walking along the
	walls. (Abu Da'ud). All these Commandments clearly show that mixed
	gatherings of the men and women are wholly alien to the temper of
	Islam. It cannot therefore be imagined that Divine Law which
	disallows the men and women to stand side by side for prayers in the
	sacred houses of Allah, would allow them to mix together freely in
	colleges, offices, clubs and other gatherings. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	eradication of which Allah and His Prophet have given such detailed
	Commandments, or if due to some weakness he violates one or more of
	these Commandments, he should at least realize that he is committing
	a sin, and regard it as such, and should abstain from labeling it as
	a virtue by misinterpretation. Apart from these alternatives, the

	prove them Islam itself, and openly claim that there is no such

	but also display ignorance and hypocritical obstinacy. Such an
	attitude can neither be commended by any right-thinking person in
	this world, nor can it merit favor with Allah in the Hereafter. But
	among the Muslims there exists a section of modern hypocrites who
	are so advanced in their hypocrisy that they repudiate the Divine
	injunctions as false and believe those ways of life to be right and
	based on truth, which they have borrowed from the non-Muslim

	as a term means a deed of emancipation between the owner and the
	slave entitling the latter to earn his or her freedom after payment
	of an agreed sum of money in a certain period. This is one of the
	methods laid down in Islam for the slaves to attain their freedom.
	It is not essential that the slave must always pay in cash; he can
	also earn his freedom by rendering some special service to the
	owner, provided that both the parties agree. Once the agreement is
	signed, the owner is not entitled to put any obstacles in the way of
	the slave's freedom. He will have to provide opportunities to enable
	him to earn for his emancipation and shall have to free him when the
	agreed amount has been paid in time. In the time of Hadrat 'Umar, a
	slave entered into such an agreement with his lady owner, but
	managed to collect the amount in advance of the time limit. When the
	amount was offered to the lady, she refused to accept it on the
	ground that she would like to have it in monthly and yearly
	installments. The slave complained to Hadrat 'Umar who ordered that
	the amount be deposited in the state treasury and the slave be sec

	'Abdul Rahman bin Zaid, Sufyan Thauri, Abu Hanifah and Malik bin
	Anas and Imam Shafi`i later on also had adopted this view. The first

	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a) The
	imperative mood of the verb in &quot;execute the deed...,' suggests
	that it is a Command front Allah. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b)
	Authentic Traditions contain the incident that when Sirin, father of
	Hadrat Muhammad bin Sirin, the great jurist and traditionalist, made
	a request to his master, Hadrat Anas, for a deed of emancipation,
	the latter refused to accept it. Sirin took he matter before Hadrat
	`Umar, who whip in hand turned on Anas, saying: &quot;Allah's
	Command is that you execute the deed.&quot; (Bukhari). From this it
	has been argued that it was not a discretionary and personal
	decision of Hadrat 'Umar but it was taken in the presence of the
	Companions and none expressed any difference of opinion. This
	therefore should be taken as an authentic interpretation of the
	verse. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	group argues that Allah does not merely say: &quot;Execute the deed
	of emancipation with them&quot;, but adds: &quot;. . . provided that
	you trod some good in them.&quot; This condition of finding some
	good in them&quot; lies entirely on the owner, and there is no fixed
	standard or means by which the question of &quot;finding good in
	them&quot; be got adjudicated through a court. Legal injunctions are
	never couched in such language. As such this injunction can only be
	regarded as recommendatory and not as legally mandatory. As regards
	the precedent of the case of Sirin, the jurists say that there was
	not one slave who asked for a deed of emancipation but thousands of
	them in the time of the Holy Prophet and the rightly-guided Caliphs,
	and a large number of them earned their freedom in that way. But
	apart from Sirin's there is no case where an owner was forced by a
	judicial verdict to execute a deed of emancipation. Accordingly this
	decision of Hadrat 'Umar cannot be taken as a judicial decision. All
	that can be said is that Hadrat `Umar, apart from his position of a
	judge, was like a father to the Muslims and might have used his
	paternal authority in a matter where he could not intervene as a

	most concise way. You should free the slaves and help them to earn
	their freedom, If you present a head of cattle to somebody, present
	such a one as gives plenty of milk. Treat your relatives kindly even
	if they treat you unjustly. If you cannot do all this, you should
	feed the poor, give water to the thirsty, exhort the people to do
	good and forbid them to do evil. If you cannot do even this, you
	should restrain your tongue: if you have to speak, speak something
	good, otherwise keep quiet&quot;'. (Baihaqi).

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(c) The
	Islamic government is advised to spend a part of the Zakat
	collections on the emancipation of slaves. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here it
	should be noted that slaves in the ancient tunes were of three
	kinds: (i) Prisoners of war, (ii) Free men who were captured and
	traded as slaves, (iii) Hereditary slaves who did not know when
	their ancestors became slaves and to which of the above categories
	they originally belonged. Before the advent of Islam, Arabia as well
	as the outside world abounded in all kinds of slaves. The entire
	social and economic structure of society depended more on slave
	labor than on servants and wage-earners. The first question before
	Islam was to tackle the problem of the hereditary slaves, and
	secondly, to find a solution to the entire problem of slavery for
	all times to come. In tackling the first problem, Islam did not
	abruptly abrogate the ownership rights in respect of the hereditary
	slaves as it would have completely paralyzed the entire social and
	economic system, and involved Arabia in a far more destructive civil
	war than the one fought in America, leaving the problem where it was
	as it is in America, where the Negroes are still facing humiliation
	and disgrace. Islam did not follow any such foolhardy policy of
	reform. Instead it generated a great moral movement for the
	emancipation of slaves and employed inducements, persuasions,
	religious injunctions and legal enactments to educate and motivate
	the people to free the slaves voluntarily for earning their
	salvation in the Hereafter, or as expiation of their sins as
	enjoined by Islam, or by accepting monetary compensation. To set the
	pace the Holy Prophet himself freed 63 slaves. One of his wives,
	Hadrat 'A'ishah, alone treed 67 slaves. The Holy Prophet's uncle,
	Hadrat `Abbas, freed 70 slaves. Among others, Hakim bin Hizam freed
	100 slaves, 'Abdullah bin 'Umar 1,000, Zulkal'a Himyari 8,000, and
	'Abdur Rehman bin 'Auf 30,000. The other Companions among whom
	Hadrat Abu Bakr and Hadrat 'Uthman were prominent also set a large
	number of slaves free. The people, in order to win Allah's favor,
	not only emancipated their own slaves, but also bought them from
	others and then set them free. The result was that in so far as
	hereditary slaves were concerned, almost all of them had been freed
	even before the righteous Caliphate came to an end. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">As for
	the future, Islam completely prohibited free men from being
	kidnapped and traded as slaves. As for the prisoners of war, it was
	permitted (not commanded) that they might be kept as slaves so long
	as they were not exchanged for Muslim prisoners of war, or freed on
	payment of ransom. Then, on the one hand, the slaves were also
	allowed to earn their freedom through written agreements with their
	masters, and on the other, the masters were exhorted to set them
	free just like the hereditary slaves, as an act of virtue, to win
	Allah's approval, or as expiation of sins, or by willing that a
	slave would automatically gain his freedom on the master's death, or
	that a slave girl would be free on the master's death if she had
	borne him children, whether he had left a will or not. This is how
	Islam solved the problem of slavery. Ignorant people raise
	objections without trying to understand this solution, and the
	apologists offer all sorts of apologies and have even to deny the
	fact that Islam had prohibited slavery absolutely.</P>

	does not mean that if the slave girls do not want to lead a chaste
	and virtuous life they can be forced into prostitution. It only
	means this that if a slave girl commits an immoral act of her own
	free will, she herself is responsible for it and the law will be
	applied against her alone. But if the owner forces her into it, it
	will be entirely his responsibility, and the law will proceed

	someone is compelled to act against his own will. As for the words
	&quot;for your own worldly gains&quot;, these have not been used in
	a conditional or restrictive sense that if the owner is not sharing
	the immoral earnings of the slave girl, he is not an offender if he

	money unlawful as has been earned through illegal and immoral ways. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">It is,
	however, not possible to comprehend the full import of this
	injunction merely from the words of the text. For this it is
	necessary to understand the entire background and circumstances
	prevalent at the time of its revelation. Prostitution in Arabia
	existed in two forms: Domestic prostitution and open prostitution in
	the brothel. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a)
	'Domestic' prostitution was carried out by freed slave girls who had
	no guardians, or by free women who had no family or tribal support.
	They would take residence in a house and enter into an agreement
	with a number of men simultaneously for financial help in return for
	sexual gratification. Whenever a child was born, the mother would
	name whomsoever she liked as its father and the man was accepted in
	society as the father of the child. This was an established custom
	in the pre-Islamic days, which was considered almost analogous to
	&quot;marriage&quot;. When Islam came, it recognized only that
	contract as legal marriage where a woman had only one husband. Thus
	all other forms of sexual gratification came to be regarded as
	adultery and punishable offenses as such. (Abu Da'ud). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b) Open
	prostitution which was carried out entirely through slave girls was
	of two kinds. First, the slave girls were obliged to pay a fixed
	heavy amount every month to the owner, which they could only earn
	through prostitution. The owner knew fully well how the money was
	earned, and in fact there was no other object of imposing a heavy
	demand on the poor slave girl, especially when it was much higher
	than the usual wages for work or labor. Secondly, beautiful and
	young slave girls were made to stay in the brothel and a flag was
	put at the door to indicate that a &quot;needy person&quot; could
	satisfy his lust there. Such women were called &quot;qaliqiyat&quot;
	and their houses were well known as, &quot;mawakhir&quot;'. All
	prominent men of the 'day owned and maintained such houses of
	prostitution. `Abdullah bin Ubayy (the chief of the hypocrites of
	Madinah, who had been nominated as king of Madinah before the Holy
	Prophet's arrival there and who was in the forefront of the campaign
	to slander Hadrat `A'ishah) himself owned a regular house of
	prostitution in Madinah, which had six beautiful slave girls. Not
	only did he earn money through them but also used them to entertain
	his respectable and important guests who came to see him from
	different parts of Arabia. He employed the illegitimate children
	thus born to enhance the splendor and strength of his army of
	slaves. When one of these prostitutes, named Mu'azah, accepted Islam
	and wanted to offer repentance for her past sins, Ibn Ubayy
	subjected her to torture. She complained of it to Hadrat Abu Bakr,
	who brought it to the notice of the Holy Prophet. The Holy Prophet
	ordered that the woman be taken away from the cruel man. (Ibn Jarir,
	Vol. XVIII, pp. 55 -58, and 103-104; Al Isti`ab Vol 11, p. 762; p.
	762; Ibn Kathir, Vol. III, pp. 288-289). Such were the conditions
	when this verse was revealed. If these conditions are kept in view,
	it will become obvious that the real object was not merely to stop
	the slave girls from being forced into prostitution but to ban
	prostitution itself as illegal within the boundaries of the Islamic
	state. Simultaneously there was a declaration of general pardon for
	those who had been forced into this business in the past. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">After the
	revelation of this Divine Command the Holy Prophet declared: &quot;There
	is no place for prostitution in Islam.&quot; (Abu Da'ud). The second
	Command that he gave was that the earnings made through adultery
	were unlawful, impure and absolutely forbidden. According to a
	tradition reported by Rafi` bin Khadij, the Holy Prophet described
	such earnings as impure, product of the worst profession and most
	filthy income. (Abu Da'ud, Tirmizi, Nasa'i). According to Abu
	Huzaifah, he termed the money earned through prostitution as
	unlawful. (Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad). Abu Mas`ud `Uqbah bin `Amr says
	that the Holy Prophet forbade the people to take prostitution
	earnings. (Sihah Sitta and Ahmad). The third Command was that the
	slave girl could be employed for lawful manual labor, but the owner
	had no right to impose or receive any money from her about which he
	was not sure how it had been earned. According to Rafi` bin Khadij,
	he prohibited accepting any earnings from the slave girl unless it
	was known how she had earned it. (Abu Da'ud). Rafi` bin Rifa`ah
	Ansari has reported the same Command in clearer words. He says: &quot;The
	Prophet of Allah prohibited us from accepting anything from the
	earnings of a slave girl except that which she earned through manual
	labour, such as (and he indicated this with his hand) baking bread,
	spinning cotton or carding wool or cotton.&quot; (Musnad Ahmad, Abu
	Da'ud). Another tradition quoted from Hadrat Abu Hurairah in Abu
	Da'ud and Musnad Ahmad says that taking of money earned by a slave
	girl through unlawful means is prohibited. Thus the Holy Prophet in
	accordance with the intention of this verse, banned by religious
	injunction and law all kinds of prostitution prevalent in Arabia in
	those days. Over and above this, the decision he gave in the case of
	Mu'azah, the slave girl of `Abdullah bin Ubayy, shows that an owner
	who forces his slave girl into prostitution loses his rights of
	ownership over her. This is a tradition from Imam Zuhri, which Ibn
	Kathir has quoted on the authority of Musnad `Abdur Razzaq.

	able to distinguish between a true believer and a hypocrite. Then if

	&quot;Allah is the light of the whole universe&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Light is
	something which makes things visible; which is itself manifest and
	helps make other things manifest. The human mind conceives light in
	this very sense. Absence of light is termed darkness, invisibility
	and obscurity. On the other hand, when there is visibility and
	things become exposed to view, man says there is light. Allah has
	been called `Light' in this basic sense, and not in the sense of a
	beam of light which travels at the speed of 186,000 miles per second
	and stimulates the optic nerve through the retina. This conception
	of light has nothing to do with the reality of the meaning for which
	human mind has coined this word; rather the word light is used for
	all those lights which we experience in this physical world All
	human words used for Allah are used in their basic sense and
	meaning, and not with reference to their physical connotation. For
	instance, when, the word &quot;sight&quot; is used with respect to
	Allah, it does not mean that Allah has an eye like men and animals
	with which He sees. Similarly when we say that Allah 'hears' or
	'grips' or 'grasps', it does not mean that He hears through ears, or
	grips or grasps with the hand like us. These words are used in a
	metaphorical sense and only a man of very poor intelligence would
	have the misconception that hearing or seeing or grasping is not
	possible except in the limited and specific sense in which we
	experience it. Similarly it will be shortsightedness to interpret
	the word 'light' in the sense of physical light rays emanating from
	a luminous body and affecting the retina. This word is not
	applicable to Allah in its limited sense, but in its absolute sense.
	That is, He alone in this universe is the real and prime &quot;Cause
	of manifestation&quot;, otherwise there is nothing but darkness.
	here. Everything which gives light and illuminates other things has

	antiquity the source for brilliant light were the olive lamps, and
	the most superior oil for the purpose was that obtained from a tree
	standing in an open and elevated place. The epithet of Lamp for
	Allah in the parable does trot mean that Allah is deriving His
	energy from some external source. It only means that the Lamp of the

	shows that the use of the word &quot;light&quot; for Allah does not

	of true believers. In this parable they are being told that their
	expectations of reaping benefits of their ostentatious deeds of
	virtue in the Hereafter are no more than a mirage. Just as a
	traveler in the desert takes the glittering sands for a surging pool
	of water and runs towards it for quenching his thirst, so are these
	people traveling on the road to death cherishing false hopes on
	account of their good deeds. But just as the one running towards a
	mirage does not find anything there to quench his thirst, so will
	these people find nothing to avail them when they enter the state of
	death. On the contrary, they will find Allah there, Who will require
	them to account for their disbelief, hypocrisy and misdeeds, which
	they committed along with their ostentatious deeds of virtue, and
	will deal with them in full justice.

	has been hinted in the beginning of this discourse, this means to
	warn the hypocrites that the promise of Allah to bestow
	successorship in the land is not meant for those people who are
	Muslims only in name, but for those who are true in faith, pious in
	character, sincere in devotion and who follow Allah's religion in
	letter and spirit eschewing every tinge of shirk. Those who lack
	these qualities and pay mere lip service to Islam are neither worthy
	of this promise nor its addressees. Therefore they should entertain
	no hope of having any share in it. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	people interpret Khilafat (successorship in the land) to mean
	political power and authority, and conversely conclude that
	whosoever possesses power and authority in the land is necessarily a
	true believer and a follower of Allah's approved religion and His
	devotee, free from all traces of shirk. Then in order to get support
	for their wrong conclusion, they even change the very meanings of
	Faith, virtue, Divine Creed, Allah's worship, idolatry, etc. to suit
	their interpretation. This is the worst distortion of the meaning of
	the Qur'an, even worse than what the Jews and Christians did with
	their Scriptures. This interpretation of the verse tends to destroy
	the very message of the Qur'an. If `successorship in the land' were
	to mean mere power and authority in the land; then all those people
	who wielded power and authority in the world, or wield it today.,
	would fit in with the description contained in the verse, even if
	they denied Allah, Revelations, Prophethood, life in the Hereafter,
	and were involved in all kinds of major sins like usury, adultery,
	drinking and gambling. Now if all such people are regarded as pious
	believers and considered worthy of holding the high offices because
	of their qualities as such, then `Faith' would imply simple
	obedience to physical laws and `Virtue' would mean making use of
	those laws effectively and successfully. Allah's approved religion
	would mean making maximum progress -in the fields of industry and
	trade, commerce and politics by achieving excellence in the physical
	sciences; devotion to Allah would mean abiding by the rules and
	procedures which are naturally useful and essential for success in
	individual and collective enterprises; and shirk would mean adopting
	a few harmful methods also along with the useful procedures and
	rules. But the question is: Would a person who has studied the
	Qur'an with an open heart and mind ever believe that the terms
	`Faith', 'Righteous deeds', `True Religion', `Devotion to Allah',
	Tauhid and Shirk as used in the Qur'an really mean this ? As a
	matter of fact, such a meaning can be understood either by the one
	who has never made an intelligent study of the Qur'an as a whole,
	but has picked up verses from here and there and given them his own
	biased meaning according to preconceived notions and theories, or by
	the one who has read the Qur'an through but has all along been
	holding all those verses as wrong and absurd, which invite people to
	accept Allah as the One and only Lord, His Revelations as the only
	source of Guidance, His Messengers as the only true Guides worthy of
	absolute obedience, and which demand not only belief in the
	life-after-death, but also state that the people who would consider
	success in the worldly life as their sole and ultimate objective,
	without any idea of their accountability in the Hereafter, would be
	deprived of real success. The Qur'an has repeated these themes so
	frequently in diverse ways and in such clear and plain language that
	it is difficult to believe that anybody who studies it honestly can
	ever be involved in those misunderstandings in which the modern
	interpreters of this verse have been involved. The fact is that they
	have misconstrued Khilafat and Istikhlaf (successorship) after their
	own notions, which cannot be held as correct by anybody who has some
	knowledge of the Qur'an.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Qur'an has used Khilafat and Istikhlaf in the following three
	meanings and the context determines in which particular meaning it
	has been used in a particular place:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a) &quot;To
	bear the authority delegated by Allah&quot;. The whole human race is
	Allah's Khalifah (successor) on the earth in this sense. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b) &quot;To
	acknowledge Allah as the Supreme Sovereign and to use His delegated
	powers and authority in accordance with His Law.&quot; In this sense
	only a pious and righteous believer can be a Khalifah, because he
	alone can discharge the responsibilities of Khilafat truly. On the
	other hand, a disbeliever and sinner cannot be Khalifah: he is
	rather a rebel against Allah, because he abuses the power and
	authority delegated by Allah in disobedience to Him in the land
	bestowed by Him. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(c) &quot;The
	succession of one ruling nation in the land after the fall of
	another nation.&quot; The meanings (a) and (b) imply vicegerency
	while (c) implies successorship. Both these meanings of Khilafat are
	well known and recognized in the Arabic lexicon. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Now
	anybody who reads this verse in this context cannot have any doubt
	that the word Khilafat has been used here for the government which
	discharges the responsibilities of Allah's Vicegerency strictly in
	accordance with Allah's Law, and not in accordance with mere
	physical laws of the world. That is why, not to speak of the
	disbelievers, even the hypocrites, who professed faith in Islam, are
	being excluded from the purview of Allah's promise. That is why it
	is being stated that true and righteous believers only are worthy of
	this promise. That is why it is being averred that the establishment
	of Khilafat will result in the establishment of Islam, Allah's
	approved religion, on strong foundations; and that is why the
	condition being put forward for earning this favor is that the
	believers should remain steadfast in their faith and devotion to
	Allah avoiding every tinge of shirk. To remove this promise from its
	right context and apply it on the international scene to the case of
	America and Russia, or any other power that be, is sheer absurdity
	and nonsense. (For further details, see E. N. 99 of Al-Anbiya'
	also). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	thing that needs to be mentioned here is that the direct addressees
	of this promise were the Muslims living in the time of the Holy
	Prophet though indirectly it applies to the future generations of
	Muslims as well. When in the beginning this promise was held out by
	Allah, the Muslims were living in a state of fear and Islam had not
	yet taken firm roots even in Hejaz. A few years later this state of
	fear not only gave way to peace and equanimity but Islam also spread
	outside Arabia to large parts of Africa and Asia, and it became
	firmly established not only in its own land of birth but outside it
	as well. This is a historical proof of the fact that Allah fulfilled
	His promise in the times of Hadrat Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman (may
	Allah he pleased with them all). No right thinking person,
	therefore, can have any doubt that the Khilafat of the first three
	Caliphs has been authenticated by the Qur'an itself and Allah
	Himself has testified to their being pious Believers. If anybody
	still has a doubt, he should read the address of Hadrat 'AIi in
	Nahjal Balaghah, which was meant to dissuade Hadrat 'Umar from going
	personally to tight against the Iranians. He said: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;Our
	success in this work is not dependent on numerical strength; it is
	the religion of Allah for which He Himself has opened ways. We are
	grateful to Him for His help and succor which has enabled us to
	serve its cause till it has been raised to its present glory Allah
	Himself has said: `Allah has promised to those among you, who
	believe and do righteous deeds that He will make them successors in
	the land .... ' Allah will certainly fulfill this promise and will
	help the armies of Islam. The position of the Caliph in Islam is
	like that of the string in a necklace of pearls. If the string
	breaks, the pearls scatter away and the order is destroyed. Once
	scattered and dispersed, it becomes difficult to collect them again.
	No doubt the Arabs are small in number, but they have been increased
	by Islam and strengthened by unity. You should therefore stick to
	Madinah like the pivot and make the grindstone of Arabia rotate
	about you and guide the war-machine from here. Once you leave this
	place, your entire organization will begin to crumble, then you will
	start feeling more worried about the dangers behind than the enemies
	in front. Moreover, the Iranians will concentrate their whole
	attention on you, and will like to exterminate you, taking you as
	the main and only hurdle in their way to victory. As for your
	apprehension that they have come out in much greater strength, I
	would say that hitherto we have been fighting them not merely on the
	strength of numbers, but have been putting them to rout on the
	strength of Allah's help and succor.&quot; Any discerning reader can
	see for himself as to which side is being held by Hadrat `Ali as
	worthy of Allah's promise with regard to successorship in the land.

	is, when they have reached the age of puberty. As has been explained
	in E.N. 87 above, the signs of puberty in the case of boys and girls
	are nocturnal emission and menstrual discharge respectively. There
	is, however, a difference of opinion among the jurists regarding the
	beginning of puberty in those boys and girls who for some reason do
	not show these physical signs for an unduly long time. According to
	Imam Shafi`i, Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad and Imam Ahmad, a boy or
	a girl of IS years will be considered to have attained puberty, and
	a saying of Imam Abu Hanifah also supports this view. But the
	wellknown view of Imam Abu Hanifah is that in such cases the age of
	puberty will be 17 years for girls and 18 years for boys. Both these
	opinions are the result of juristic reasoning and neither is based
	on any injunction of the Qur'an or Sunnah. It is therefore not
	necessary that the age limits of 15 or 18 years be accepted as
	marking the beginning of puberty everywhere in the world in abnormal
	cases. In different countries and ages there are different
	conditions of physical development and growth. The age of puberty in
	a certain country can be determined by means of the law of averages
	in normal cases. As for abnormal cases, the mean difference of ages
	may be added to the upper age limit to determine the age of puberty.
	For instance, if in a country, the minimum and maximum ages for
	noctural discharge are normally 12 and 15 years respectively, the
	mean difference of one and a half years may be added to the maximum
	limit of 15 years to determine the beginning of puberty for abnormal
	cases. The same principle can be used by the legal experts of
	various countries to fix the age of puberty keeping in view their
	peculiar local conditions.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">There is
	a tradition quoted from Ibn `Umar in support of the age of 15 years

	the Holy Prophet to ask his permission to join the Battle of Uhud,
	but he declined permission. Then on the occasion of the Battle of
	the Trench, when I was 15, I was again presented and he permitted me
	to join.&quot; (Sihah Sitta, Musnad Ahmad). This tradition, however,
	does not stand scrutiny for the following two reasons:

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a) The

	A.H. according to Ibn Sa`d. There is an interval of two years or
	more between the two events. Now if Ibn `Umar was 14 at the time of
	the Battle of Uhud, he could not be 15 at the time of the Battle of
	the Trench. It may be that he mentioned 14 years for 13 years and 11

	analogous and juristic reasoning and not on the basis of anything in

<DIV ID="sdfootnote96">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote96sym" HREF="#sdfootnote96anc">95</A>Three
	things are necessary to understand this verse:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a) The
	verse consists of two parts: the first part relates to the sick, the
	lame, the blind and other handicapped people, and the second part to
	the other People.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b) The
	moral teachings of the Qur'an had so thoroughly changed the Arab
	mind that they had become highly sensitive with regard to the
	distinction between the lawful and the unlawful. According to Ibn
	`Abbas, when Allah commanded them &quot;not to devour one another's
	property by unlawful ways&quot; (IV: 29), the people became unduly
	cautious and would not eat freely at each other's house; so much so
	that unless a formal invitation was extended, they considered it
	unlawful even to dine in the house of a relative or a friend 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(c) The
	mention of &quot;taking meals at your own houses&quot; only means to
	.impress that taking meals at the house of a relative or a friend is
	just like taking meals at one's own house, where no permission is
	required.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">With
	these three things in mind, one can easily understand the meaning of
	the verse. It says that the handicapped person can have his meal
	anywhere and at any house in order to satisfy his hunger, because
	the society as a whole owes to him this privilege on account of his
	handicap. As for the other people, for them their `own houses' and
	the houses of the relatives mentioned in the verse are equally good
	for the purpose. No formal invitation or permission is needed to
	have the meals of their houses. In the absence of the master, if his
	wife or children offer something, it can be taken without
	hesitation. In this connection, it should be noted that the houses
	of one's children are just like one's own house, and the friends
	imply close friends.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV ID="sdfootnote97">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote97sym" HREF="#sdfootnote97anc">96</A>In
	ancient Arabia, some tribes had the tradition that each member sat
	and ate separately. Eating together in one place was considered bad
	as some Hindus do even today. On the contrary, some other tribes
	considered it bad to eat alone individually; so much so that they
	would even go without food if they did not have company at meals.
	This verse means to abolish such customs and restrictions.

<DIV ID="sdfootnote98">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote98sym" HREF="#sdfootnote98anc">97</A>These

	Commandment is also applicable in respect of the successors of the
	Holy Prophet after him and other leaders of the Muslims. When the

	or disperse without due permission of the leader.</P>

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote100sym" HREF="#sdfootnote100anc">99</A>This

<DIV ID="sdfootnote101">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote101sym" HREF="#sdfootnote101anc">100</A>That
	is, it depends upon the Prophet or his successor after him to grant
	or not to grant permission even in case of a genuine need. If he
	deems the collective cause to be more important than the individual
	need of the person, he may refuse permission, and a believer will
	not mind it.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote102">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote102sym" HREF="#sdfootnote102anc">101</A>This
	again contains a warning: If in asking permission there is even a
	tinge of excuse making, or of placing individual interests above
	collective interests, it would be a sin. Therefore the Prophet or
	his successor should also pray for the forgiveness of the one whom
	he gives permission.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote103">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote103sym" HREF="#sdfootnote103anc">102</A>Dua
	means `to summon', `to pray' and` to call`. Dua'-ar-Rasul,
	therefore, may mean `summoning or praying by the Messenger' or
	`calling the Messenger'. The verse can thus have three meanings
	which would all be equally correct; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(a) &quot;The
	Prophet's summons should not be treated as a common man's summons&quot;,
	for the Prophet's summon is of extraordinary importance, which you
	cannot ignore, because if you fail to respond to it, or feel
	hesitant about it, you will be doing so at the very risk of your
	faith 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(b) &quot;Do
	not consider the Prophet's prayer as a common man's prayer&quot;. If
	he is pleased with you and prays for you, there can be no greater
	good fortune for you. But if he is displeased with you and curses
	you, there can be no greater misfortune for you. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(c)
	&quot;Calling the Prophet should not be like calling among
	yourselves of each other. That is, you should not call or address
	the Prophet just as you call and address other people aloud by their
	names. You should have full respect for' him, because the slightest
	disrespect in this regard will call for Allah's reckoning in the
	Hereafter. Though all the three meanings quite fit in with the
	context, the first meaning is more in keeping with the theme which
	follows.</P>

<DIV ID="sdfootnote104">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote104sym" HREF="#sdfootnote104anc">103</A>This
	is yet another trait of the hypocrites. When they are summoned to
	gather together for a collective cause, they do respond to the call,
	because they want to be counted among the Muslims. But they grudge
	their presence, and steal away somehow as soon as they find an
	opportunity.</P>

	be many other forms of affliction also; for instance, sectarian
	differences, civil war, moral degradation, disruption of community
