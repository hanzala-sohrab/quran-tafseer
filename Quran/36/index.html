Prophet Muhammad, from the fact that he was facing all kinds of

Ahmad, Abu Daud, Nasai, Ibn Majah and Tabarani have related on the

because Al Fatihah contains the sum and substance of the teaching of
the whole Quran. The Surah Ya Sin has been called the throbbing heart
of the Qur'an because it presents the message of the Qur'an in a most
forceful manner, which breaks the inertness and stirs the spirit of

Imam Ahmad, Aba Da'ud and Ibn Majah have related from the same Ma'qil
bin Yasar that the Holy Prophet said: &quot;Recite Surah Ya Sin to
the dying ones among you.&quot; The object is not only to revive and
refresh the whole Islamic creed in the mind of the dying person but
also bring before him, in particular, a complete picture of the
Hereafter so that he may know what stages he would have to pass
through after crossing the stage of this worldly life. In view of
this, it would be desirable that along with the recitation of the
Surah Ya Sin its translation also is made for the benefit of the
person who does not know Arabic so that the purpose of the admonition
is duly fulfilled. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	which their forefathers had been warned, because they live in

	may rise here: How could the forefathers of a nation to whom no
	warner had been sent at a particular time in the past, be held
	responsible for their deviation at that time? The answer is: When
	Allah sends a Prophet in the world, the influence of his message and
	teaching spreads far and wide, and is handed down by one generation
	to the other. As long as this influence remains and there continue
	arising among the followers of the Prophet such people as keep his
	message of guidance fresh, the period pf time cannot be said to be
	without the guidance. And when the influence of the Prophet's
	teaching dies out, or the teaching is tampered with, the appointment
	of another Prophet becomes inevitable. Before the advent of the Holy
	Prophet the influence of the teachings of the Prophets Abraham,
	Ishmael, Shu'aib and Moses and Jesus (peace be upon all of them)
	could be seen everywhere in Arabia and from time to time there had
	been arising among the Arabs, or coming from outside, men, who
	revived their teachings. When the influence was about to die out,
	and the real teaching was also distorted, Allah raised the Prophet
	Muhammad, and made such arrangements that his message can neither be
	wiped out nor tampered with. (For further explanation, see E N. 5 of
	Surah Saba above).&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote10sym" HREF="#sdfootnote10anc">10</A>The
	early commentators, generally, have expressed the opinion that the
	&quot;habitation&quot; implies the Syrian city of Antioch, and the
	messengers mentioned here were the ones sent by the Prophet Jesus
	for the preaching of his message there. Another thing that has been
	mentioned in this connection is that Antiochus was the king of this
	land at that time. But historically this story which Ibn 'Abbas,
	Qatadah, 'Ikrimah, Ka'b Ahbar and Wahb bin Munabbih, and others have
	related on the basis of unauthentic Christian traditions is
	baseless. There have been 13 kings of the Seleucid dynasty named
	Antiochus who reigned in Antioch, and the rule of the last king of
	this name, rather the rule of this dynasty itself, carne to an end
	in 65 B.C. At the time of the Prophet Jesus, the whole land of Syria
	and Palestine, including Antioch, was under the Romans. Then, no
	proof is forthcoming from any authentic tradition of the Christians
	that the Prophet Jesus might himself have sent any of his disciples
	to Antioch for preaching his message. On the contrary, the Acts of
	the Apostles (N.T.) shows that the Christian preachers had reached
	Antioch for the first time a few years after the event of the
	crucifixion. Now, evidently, the people who were neither appointed
	messengers by Allah nor sent by His Messenger cannot be regarded as
	messengers of Allah by any interpretation even if they might have
	travelled for the purpose of preaching of their own accord.
	Moreover, according to the Bible; Antioch was the first city where
	the non-Israelites embraced Christianity in large numbers and where
	the Christian faith met with great success; whereas the habitation
	mentioned by the Qur'an was some such habitation which rejected the
	invitation of the messengers, and was consequently punished with a
	Divine torment. History also does not bear any evidence that Antioch
	was ever afflicted with a destruction, which might be regarded, as
	the result of denying the Prophethood. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">On
	account of these reasons it cannot be accepted that the `habitation&quot;
	implies Antioch. The habitation has neither been clearly determined
	in the Qur'an nor in any authentic Hadith; the identity of the
	messengers also is not known through any authentic means nor the
	time when they were appointed. To understand the purpose for which
	the Qur'an is narrating this story here, it is not necessary to know
	the names of the habitation and the messengers. The object is to
	warn the Quraish, as if to say: `You arc following the same path of
	stubbornness, prejudice and denial of the truth as had been followed
	by the people of that habitation, and are preparing yourselves to
	meet the same doom as was met by them.

	these brief sentences the vegetable and plant life of the earth has
	been presented as an argument. Man is eating the products of the
	earth day and night and regards this as very ordinary. But if he
	considers it seriously, he will see drat the growth of rich crops
	and lush green gardens from the dry earth and the flowing in it of
	the springs and rivers is not a simple thing, which might be
	happening of itself, but there is a great wisdom and power and
	providence which is working behind it. Consider the reality of the
	earth. The substances of which it is composed do not possess any
	power of their own for growth. All these substances individually as
	well as after every sort of combination, remain inorganic, and thus
	do not possess any sign of life. The question is: How did it become
	possible for plant life to emerge from the lifeless earth? If one
	looks into it, one will see that there are some important factors
	without whose provision beforehand life here could not have coma
	into existence. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">First, in
	particular regions of the earth, on its outer surface, a layer was
	arranged of many such substances, which could serve as food for
	vegetation. This layer was kept soft so that the roots of the
	vegetation could spread in it and suck food. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Secondly,
	a system of irrigation was arranged on the earth in different ways
	so that the food elements could get dissolved in water and absorbed
	by the roots . 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Thirdly,
	the atmosphere was arranged around the earth which protects it
	against the calamities of the sky, becomes a means of the rainfall,
	and possesses gases which are necessary for the life and growth of
	the vegetation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Fourthly,
	a relationship was established between the sun and the earth so as
	to provide proper temperature and suitable seasons for the
	vegetation. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">With the
	provision of these main factors (which in themselves are
	combinations of countless other factors), the coming to life of the
	vegetation becomes possible. After arranging the suitable conditions
	the seed of each species of the vegetation was so constituted that
	as soon as it received favorable soil, water, air and season,
	vegetable life should begin stirring within it. Besides, inside the
	same seed a system was so arranged that from the seed of every
	species a plant precisely of the same species should grow with all
	the characteristics of its own species and heredity. Then, in
	addition to this, another wonderful thing was done. Vegetation was
	not created in twenty, or fifty, or a hundred kinds but in countless
	species, and they were so made that they should fulfill the
	requirements of food, medicine and clothing and innumerable other
	needs of the countless kinds of animals and man, who were to be
	brought into being after the vegetation on the earth. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Anyone
	who ponders over this wonderful arrangement, if he is not stubborn
	and prejudiced, will himself testify that all this could not have
	come about by itself. There is certainly a wise plan underlying it,
	according to which harmonies and relationships of the soil, water,
	air and season with respect to the vegetation, and harmonics and
	relationships of the vegetation with respect to the needs and
	requirements of animals and human beings have been determined,
	keeping in view the finest detail. No sensible person can imagine
	that these universal, all-embracing relationships could be a mere
	accident. This same subtle arrangement points to the fact that this
	cannot be the work of many gods. This is, and can only be, the work
	of One God, Who is the Creator and Lord of the earth, water, air,
	sun, vegetation, animals and mankind. If each of these had a
	separate god, it cannot be imagined that such a comprehensive and
	universal plan with such deep and wise relationship and harmony
	could be produced, and should have continued to work with such
	regularity for millions upon millions of years.

	provided all this for their survival, but thank others for the

	every error and weakness, and that another one should be His

	used these words when refuting polytheistic beliefs, because every
	belief of shirk is, in fact, an imputation of some defect, some
	weakness and some fault to Allah. When a person says that Allah has
	an associate, he, in fact, thinks that either Allah is incapable of
	running and ruling His Kingdom alone, or He is under compulsion to
	make another His associate in His work. Or, some other beings are so

	God forbid, Allah has the weaknesses of the worldly kings, due to

	is still another argument for Tauhid. Here again certain realities
	of daily experience have been mentioned and it is suggested that man
	observes these day and night but does not ponder over them
	seriously, whereas they contain signs and pointers to the reality.
	The coming together of the man and woman is the cause of man's own
	birth. Procreation among the animals also is due to the combination
	between the male and the female. About vegetation also man knows
	that the law of sex is working in it. Even among the lifeless
	substances when different things combine with one another, a variety
	of compounds come into existence. The basic composition of matter
	itself has become possible due to the close affinity between the
	positive and the negative electric charges. This law of the pairs
	which is the basis of the existence of the entire universe, contains
	in itself such complexities and finenesses of wisdom and
	workmanship, and there exist such harmonies and mutual relationships
	between the members of each pair that an objective observer can
	neither regard it as the result of an accident, nor can he believe
	that many different gods might have created these countless pairs
	and matched their members, one with the other, with such great
	wisdom. The members of each pair's being a perfect match for each

	alternation of the night and day also is one of those realities
	which man does not regard as worthy of much attention only because
	it is a phenomenon of daily occurrence and experience; whereas if he
	considers how the day passes and how the night falls, and what is
	the wisdom in the passing of the day and in the falling of the
	night, he will himself realize that this is an obvious sign of the
	existence of an All-Powerful and All-Wise Allah and of His being One
	and only One. The day cannot pass and the night cannot fall until
	the sun hides from the earth. The great regularity which is found in
	the alternation of the day and night, was not possible unless the
	sun and the earth were bound in one and the same relentless system.
	Then the deep relationship which exists between the alternation of
	the day and night and the other creations on the earth clearly
	points to the fact that this system has been established
	deliberately by a Being with perfect wisdom. The existence on the
	earth, of the men and animals and vegetation, and even of water and
	air and different minerals, is in fact, the result of placing the
	earth at a particular distance from the sun, with the arrangement
	that the different parts of the earth should go on successively
	coming before the sun and hiding from it at definite intervals. If
	the distance of the earth from the sun had been a little longer, or
	a little shorter, or there had been a perpetual night on one side of
	it and a perpetual day on the other, or the alternation of the day
	and night had been much faster or much slower, or sometimes the day
	had appeared suddenly and sometimes the night without any system, no
	life could be possible on this planet, and even the form and
	appearance of the inorganic substances would have been much
	different from what it is now. If the mind's eye is not closed, one
	can clearly perceive in this system the working of a God, Who willed
	to bring into being this particular kind of creation on the earth
	and then established relevances, harmonies and relationships between
	the earth and the sun precisely in accordance with its needs and
	requirements. If a person regards the concept of the existence of
	God and His Unity as far removed from reason, he should think for
	himself and see how much farther removed should it be from reason to
	ascribe this wonderful creation to many gods, or to think that All
	this has happened automatically under some deaf and blind law of
	nature. When a person who can accept without question these latter
	unreasonable explanations, only on the baal: of conjecture and
	speculation, says that the existence of a system and wisdom and
	purpose is not a sufficient proof of the existence of God, it
	becomes difficult for us to believe whether such a person really
	feels the need and necessity of a rational proof, sufficient or
	insufficient in any degree whatever, for accepting any concept of
	creed in the world.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote53sym" HREF="#sdfootnote53anc">53</A>Here
	again Allah has used `ibadat in the sense of ita'at (obedience).
	This subject has already been explained above in Al-Baqarah: 172,
	An-Nisa': 117, AI-An'am: 121, 137, At-Taubah; 31, Ibrahim: 22,
	Al-Kahf: 52, Maryam: 42, AlQasas: 63 and E.N. 63 of Saba. In this
	connection, the fine explanation given of it by Imam Razi in his
	Tafsir Kabir is also noteworthy. He writes: &quot;Do not worship
	Satan means: Do not obey him, the reason being that only falling
	prostrate before him is not forbidden, but following him and obeying
	his commands also is forbidden; therefore, ita et (obedience) is
	ibadat (worship). &quot; After this, the Imam raises the question:
	If `ibadat means ita'at, then have the Muslims been commanded to
	worship the Prophet and the rulers in the verse: Ati `ullaha wa ati
	'-ur-rasula wa ulil--amr-i min-kum? He himself answers it thus: &quot;If
	obedience to theta is in accordance with the Commands of Allah, it
	will be Allah's worship ('ibadat) and His obedience (ita`at. Did not
	the angels fall prostrate before Adam in obedience to Allah's
	Command? This was nothing but worship of Allah. Obedience of the
	rulers will be their worship only in cases where they are obeyed in
	matters in which Allah has not given leave to obey them.&quot; Then
	he writes: &quot;If a person comes to you and commands you to do
	something, you should see whether his command is in accordance with
	the Command of Allah or not. If it is not, Satan is with him; and if
	you obeyed him in this, you worshiped him and his Satan. Likewise,
	if your self urges you to do something, you should see whether it is
	permissible to do it according to the Sahari'ah or not. If it is not
	permissible, your self is Satan itself, or Satan is with it. If you
	obeyed him, you in fact became guilty of worshiping him.&quot;
	Further on, he writes: &quot;But there are different degrees of the
	worship of Satan. Sometimes it so happens that a man does a work and
	his limbs and his tongue also join him in this, and his heart also
	cooperates. At another time it so happens that a man uses his limbs
	to do a work but his heart and tongue do trot cooperate in this.
	Some people commit a sin while their heart is disagreeable and their
	tongue is invoking Allah for forgiveness, and they confess that they
	are committing an evil. This is Satan's worship with external limbs.
	There are other people who commit a crime with a cool mind and
	express pleasure and satisfaction with the tongue also.
	..........Such people are the worshipers of Satan from outside as
	well as from inside. (Tafsir Kabir, vol. VII, pp. 103-104).&nbsp;

	see what your own limbs say about your misdeeds. &quot; In this
	connection, here only the evidence to be given by the hands and the
	feet has been mentioned. But at other places it has been said that

	their body, will tell how they had been employed in the world. &quot;They
	should not forget the Day when their own tongues and their own hands

	when all will have reached there, their ears and their eyes and
	their very skins will bear witness against them concerning what they
	had been doing in the world.&quot; (Ha Mim Sajdah: 20). The question
	arises: On the one hand, Allah says: &quot;We shall seal their
	mouths,&quot; and on the other, in the verse of Surah An-Nur, He
	says: &quot;Their tongues will bear testimony against them.&quot;
	How can these two things be reconciled ? The answer is: &quot;To
	seal the mouths means to deprive them of their power of speech. That
	is, after this they will not be able to say whatever they like with
	their tongue. The testimony of their tongues mans that their tongues
