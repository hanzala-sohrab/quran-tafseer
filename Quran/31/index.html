perusal of the subject matter shows that it was sent down in the
period when persecution to suppress and thwart the invitation to
Islam had begun and every sort of machination had started being
employed for the purpose. This is borne out by vv. 14-15, in which
the young converts to Islam have been told that although the rights
of the parents are the uppermost after God, they should not listen to
them if they prevented them from accepting Islam, or compelled them
to revert to the creed of shirk and polytheism. The same thing has
been said in Surah Al-Ankabut, which indicates that both these Surahs
were sent down in the same period. A study of the style and subject
matter of the two Surahs on the whole, however, shows that Surah
Luqman was sent down earlier, for one does not see any sign of the
antagonism in its background though, contrary to this, while studying
Surah Al-Ankabut one can clearly feel that the Muslims were being
severely persecuted during the period of its revelation. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

	else around him. Lexically, there is nothing derogatory in these

	adopts falsehood instead of the Truth, turns away from the guidance
	and turns to those things which can neither benefit him in the world
	nor in the Hereafter. But this is the metaphorical meaning. The real
	meaning of the sentence is that a person should purchase an absurd
	and useless thing for his money, and this is supported by many
	traditions. Ibn Hisham has related on the authority of Ibn Ishaq
	that when the disbelievers of Makkah could not stop the message of
	the Holy Prophet from spreading in spite of their best efforts, Nadr
	bin Harith said to the people of Quraish: &quot;The way you are
	counteracting this man will avail you nothing. He has lived a
	lifetime among you. Until now he was the best of your men morally:
	he was the most truthful and the most trustworthy person among you.
	Now you say that he is a sorcerer and enchanter and a poet and a
	madman. Who will believe all this? Don't the people know the way the
	sorcerers talk? Don't they know the enchanters and the way they
	conduct their business? Are they unaware of poetry and of. the
	states of madness? Which of these accusations sticks to Muhammad
	(upon whom be Allah's peace) by exploiting which you would turn the
	people's attention away from him? Look! I will tell you how to deal
	with him.&quot; Then he left Makkah for Iraq and managed to get from
	there legends and tales about the kings of Iran and Rustam and
	Isfandyar and started to arrange tale-telling parties to distract
	the people from the Qur'an and to absorb them in the tales. (Ibn
	Hisham. vol. I, pp. 320-321). The same tradition has been cited by
	Vahidi in Asbab un Nazul on the authority of Kalbi and Muqatil. And
	according to Ibn 'Abbas, Nadr had bough singing girls also for the
	purpose. Whenever he heard that someone was coming under the Holy
	Prophet's influence, he would impose a singing girl an him with the
	instruction: &quot;Feed him and entertain him with your songs so
	that he is absorbed in you and distracted from the other side.&quot;
	This was the same device which the arch-criminals of the nations
	have been employing in every age. They try to get the common people
	so absorbed in fun and sport and musical entertainment's in the name
	of culture that they are left with no time and sense to attend to
	the serious problems of life, and in their heedlessness they do not
	even feel what destruction they are being driven to.

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The same
	commentary of lahv al-hadith has been reported from a large number
	of the Companions and their immediate followers. 'Abdullah bin
	Mas'ud was asked, 'What does lahv al-hadith mean in this verse ?&quot;
	He said thrice emphatically. 'By God! it means singing.&quot; (Ibn
	Jarir, Ibn Abi Shaibah. Hakim, Baihaqi). Similar traditions have
	been reported from scholars like 'Abdullah bin' Abbas, Jabir bin
	'Abdullah, Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, Said bin Jubair, Hasan Basri: and
	Makhul. Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim and Tirmidhi have related on the
	authority of Hadrat Abu Umamah Baheli that the Holy Prophet said,
	&quot;It is not lawful to buy and sell and trade in singing girls
	nor is it lawful to take their price.&quot; In another tradition,
	the last sentence is to the effect: ... it is unlawful to eat their
	price&quot; . Yet another tradition from Abu Umamah is to the
	effect: To teach music to slave-girls and to trade in them is not
	lawful and their price is forbidden.&quot; AII these Ahadith also
	elucidate that the verse containing lahv al-hadith was sent down in
	this very connection. Qadi Abu Bakr Ibn al-'Arabi has related in the
	Ahkam alQur'an a Hadith from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mubarak and Imam
	Malik on the authority of Hadrat Anas, saying, that the Holy Prophet
	said: 'He who hears the song of a singing-girl in a musical concert,
	will have molten lead poured into his ear on the Day of Judgment&quot;
	(In this connection, one should also note that the culture&quot; of
	music in those days flourished almost entirely through the
	slave-girls: Free women had not yet become &quot;artists&quot; .
	That is why the Holy Prophet spoke about trading in slave-girls, and
	described their wages and earnings as their price. and used the word
	qaynah for the singing-girl, which is specifically used for a
	slave-girl in Arabic).&nbsp;

	them for the first time, but the wise and learned people before them
	also have been saying the same thing, including their own famous

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Luqman
	was well known as a wise and learned man in Arabia. He has been
	mentioned in the poetry of the pre-Islamic poets like Imra'ul-Qais,
	Labid, A'asha, Tarafa and others. Some educated Arabs also possessed
	a collection of the wise sayings of Luqman. According to traditions,
	three years before the Hijrah the very first person of Madinah to be
	influenced by the Holy Prophet was Suwaid bin Samit. He went to
	Makkah for Hajj. There the Holy Prophet was as usual preaching Islam
	to the pilgrims coming from different places, at their residences.
	When Suwaid heard his speech, he submitted, &quot;I have also got a
	thing similar to what you preach,&quot; When the Holy Prophet asked
	what it was, he said, &quot;The roll of Luqman.&quot; Then on the
	Holy Prophet's instance, he read out a portion of it, whereupon the
	Holy Prophet said, &quot;This discourse is fine, but that which I
	have is better still.' Then he recited the Qur'an to him, and Suwaid
	admitted that that was certainly better than the wisdom of Luqman.
	(Ibn Hisham, vol. II, p. 3781. According to the historians, this
	person (Suwaid bin Samit) was known by the title of Kamil (Perfect)
	in Madinah on account of his ability, bravery, nobility and poetry.
	Bet when after his meeting with the Holy Prophet he returned to
	Madinah. He was killed in the battle of Bu'ath, which was fought
	some time afterwards. His tribesmen were of the opinion that he had
	become a Muslim after his meeting with the Holy Prophet 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Historically.
	Luqman is a disputed personage. In the dark centuries of ignorance
	there was no compiled history. The only source of information were
	the traditions that were being handed down since centuries.
	According to these, some people thought that Luqman belonged to the
	people of 'Ad and was a king of Yaman. Relying on these traditions,
	Maulana Sayyid Suleman Nadvi has expressed the opinion in the Ard
	al-Qar'an that Luqman was a descendent of the believers who remained
	safe with the Prophet Hud after the destruction of the people of 'Ad
	by a Divine torment, and he was one of the kings of Yaman when it
	was ruled by the 'Ad. But other traditions which have been reported
	from sane learned Companions and their immediate followers do not
	support this view. Ibn 'Abbas says Luqman was a negro slave, and the
	same is the opinion of Hadrat Abu Hurairah, Mujahid, 'Ikrimah and
	Khalid ar-Rabi. According to Hadrat Jabir bin'Abdullah Ansari, he
	belonged to Nirbah. S'id bin al-Musayyib says that Ire was an
	Egyptian negro. These three sayings closely resemble one another.
	The Arabs generally called the black people negroes (Habashis) in
	those days, and Nirbah is the country south of Egypt and north of
	Sudan. Therefore, calling the same person an Egyptian and a Nubian
	and a negro, in spite of the difference in words. is one and the
	same thing. Then the elucidations made by Suhayli in Raud al-Unuf nd
	Mas'udi in Muruj adh-Dhahab also throw some light on the question as
	to how the wisdom of this Sudanese slave spread in Arabia. They both
	agree that this person though originally a Nubian was an inhabitant
	of Madyan and Aylah (modern, 'Aqabah). That is why he spoke Arabic
	and his wisdom spread in Arabia. Besides, Suhayli also elucidates
	that Luqman the Sage and Luqman bin 'Ad were two different persons,
	and it is not correct to regard them as one and the same man. (Raud
	al-Unuf, vol. I, p. 266; Mas'udi, vol. I, p. 57). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Another
	thing may also be made clear here. The Arabic manuscript from the
	Library of Paris, which the orintalist Derenbourg has published
	under the title Amthal Luqman Hakim (Fables De Luqman Le Sage) is a
	fabricated thing which has nothing to do with the Roll of Luqman.
	These Fables were compiled by somebody in the 13th century A.D. Its
	Arabic is poor, and a perusal shows that it is, in fact, a
	translation of some other book in a different language, which the
	author or translator has himself ascribed to Luqman the Sage. The
	orientalists make such researches with a special object in view.
	They bang out such forged and fake things in order to prove that the
	narratives of the Quran are unhistorical legends and therefore
	unreliable. Anyone who reads B. Helle's article on 'Luqman&quot; in
	the Encyclopeadia of Islam will not fail to understand the real
	motive of these people.&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote20sym" HREF="#sdfootnote20anc">20</A>This
	particular admonition from the wisdom of Luqman has been cited here
	for two reasons: (1) He gave this admonition to his son, and
	obviously, no one can be insincere to one's own children. A person
	may deceive others, may behave hypocritically towards them, but no
	one, not even a most depraved person, will try to deceive and
	defraud his own children. Therefore, Luqman's admonishing his son
	thus is a clear proof of the fact that in his sight shirk was indeed
	the most heinous sin, and for that very reason he first admonished
	his dear son to refrain from this iniquity. (2) The second reason
	for this narration is that many parents from among the disbelievers
	of Makkah were compelling their children to turn away from the
	message of Tauhid being preached by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon
	whom be Allah's peace) and remain steadfast on the creed of shirk,
	as is being stated in the following verses. Therefore, those foolish
	people are being told, as if to say, The well-known sage of your own
	land had wished his children well by admonishing thetas to avoid
	shirk, now you should judge it for yourself whether you are wishing
	your children well or ill when you compel them to follow the same
	creed of shirk.&quot;&nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote21sym" HREF="#sdfootnote21anc">21</A>Zulm
	means to deprive someone of his right and to act unjustly. Shirk is
	a grave iniquity because man sets up such beings as equals with his
	Creator and Providence and Benefactor as have no share whatever in
	creating him, nor in providing for him, nor in bestowing the
	blessings on him, which he is enjoying in the world. There could be
	no greater injustice than this. The Creator's right on man is that
	he should worship Him alone, but he worships others and so deprives
	Him of His right. Then, in whatever he does in connection with the
	worship of others than Allah, he exploits many things, from his own
	mind and body to the earth and heavens, whereas, all these things
	have been created by Allah, the One. and man has no right to use any
	of them in the worship of any other than Allah Then, the right of
	man's own self on him is that he should not debase and involve it in
	punishment. But when he worships others than his Creator. he debases
	his self as well as makes it deserving of the punishment. Thus, the
	entire life of a mushrik becomes Zulm in every aspect and at all
	times and his every breath becomes an expression of injustice and
	iniquity. &nbsp;

	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote23sym" HREF="#sdfootnote23anc">23</A>From
	these words, Imam Shafe'i, Imam Ahmad, Imam Abu Yusuf. and Imam
	Muhammad have drawn the conclusion that the suckling period of the
	child is two years. If a child has been suckled by a woman within
	this period, they will be forbidden for each other, but if outside
	and beyond this period, they will not be so. A saying of Imam Malik
	also supports this. But Imam Abu Hanifah has proposed the period of
	two and a half years as a precaution, and has added that it' the
	child has been weaned after two years, or even earlier, and it is no
	longer dependent upon suckling for its food, no woman would be
	forbidden for him If she gave him suck after that period, However,
	if the real food of the child is still milk. suckling during the
	period will render him and her forbidden for each other in spite of
	his eating the other food in a more or less quantity. For, the verse
	does not mean that the child should be suckled necessarily for two
	years. In Surah AI Baqarah it has been said: 'The mothers shall
	suckle their children for two whole years, if the fathers desire the
	suckling to be completed.&quot; (v. 233). Ibn 'Abbas from these
	words has concluded, and other scholars have agreed with him in
	this, that the shortest period of pregnancy is six months, for the
	Qur'an at another place says: &quot;His bearing (in the womb) and
	his weaning took thirty months.&quot; (Ahqaf: 15) This is an
	important legal point which helps resolve many disputes concerning

	to some commentators it means this: 'Walk neither fast nor slow but
	at a moderate pace :&quot; but the context shows that here the pace
	or the rate of walking is not the question. There is nothing morally
	wrong with a fast or a slow pace in itself, nor can there be a rule
	made for it. When a man is in a hurry. he has to walk fast, and
	there is nothing wrong if one walks slow when walking for pleasure.
	Even if there is a standard for the moderate pace, it cannot be made
	a law for every person at all times. What is actually meant by this
	is to reform the state of the self under which a person walks
	haughtily. The haughtiness and arrogance of a person inevitably
	manifests itself in his gait and style of walking, which shows the
	state of his mind and also the cause of his pride and haughtiness.
	Wealth, authority, beauty. knowledge, power and such other things
	cause a man to became proud and vain, and each of these gives him a
	special style of gait. Contrary to this, manifestation of humility
	in the gait is also the result of one or the other morbid mental
	state. Sometimes the hidden conceit of the self of a man takes on
	the form of ostentatious humility, piety and godliness and this is
	shown by his gait; and sometimes man really feels so embittered by
	the frustrations of the world that he adopts a sick man's gait. What
	Luqman means to say is this: &quot;Avoid these states of the mind
	and self and walk the gait of a simple, honest and noble person,
	which neither shows any vanity and haughtiness nor weakness nor
	ostentatious piety and humility.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The taste
	of the Holy Prophet's great Companions in this regard can be judged
	from a few instances. When Hadrat Umar once saw a man walking with
	his head hung down, he shouted out to him, saying, &quot;walk with
	your head raised up. Islam is not sick. &quot;He saw another person
	walking like a weak, sick man, and said, wretch! Do not sully our
	religion! &quot; Both these incidents show that in the sight of
	Hadrat 'Umar religious piety did not at all require that one should
	walk cautiously. like the sick man and show undue humility by one's
	gait. Whenever he saw a Muslim walking such a gait, he would have
	the apprehension that it would misrepresent Islam and would depress
	the other Muslims. A similar incident was once met with by Hadrat
	'A'ishah. She saw a person walking as if run down and exhausted. She
	asked what was the matter. It was said, 'He is one of the reciters
	of the Qur'an (i e a person who remains engaged in reciting and
	teaching the Qur'an and in worship).&quot; At this she said, 'Umar
	was the chief of the reciters of the Qur'an, but as it was he would
	walk with a firm foot, and he would speak with force and strength,
	and he would give a good beating if he had to.&quot; (For further

	meant to be discouraged. One kind of lowness and loudness&quot;roughness
	and softness, of the rove and voice is that which is needed under
	natural and genuine requirements. For example, when speaking to a
	man close at hand, or to a small group of the people, one would
	speak in a low voice, and when speaking to a man at a distance or to
	a large number of the people, one would inevitably have to speak
	loudly. Similar is inevitably the difference in tones depending on
	the occasion and situation. The tone of praise has to be different
	from the tone of condemnation. and of the expression of goodwill
	from that of indignation. This thing is in no way objectionable. Nor
	does the admonition of Luqman imply that one should always speak in
	a soft and low voice and tone regardless of the occasion and

	as soon as the danger has been averted. They do not admit that they
	had perceived some signs in their own selves as well as outside
	themselves of Allah's existence and of His being only One when
	overwhelmed by the stone, and their invoking Allah was in fact the
	result of their recognition of the same reality. The atheists among
	them explain away their act, saying, &quot;It was a weakness which
	we manifested in the state of confusion and bewilderment, whereas
	there exists no God, Who might have saved us from the storm: we in

	&quot;We had the succor and protection of such and such a saint or
	god and goddess available to us by virtue of which we escaped. &quot;
	Therefore, as soon as they land on the shore, they start giving

	eventually cane to an end. Allah has kept all this information with
	Himself alone; and has not given you any knowledge of any of these.
	You actually desire that you should have the knowledge of each of
	these things so that you may make necessary preparations beforehand,
	but you have no other course open to you than to depend only on
	Allah's decree and disposal in these matters. Likewise, about the
