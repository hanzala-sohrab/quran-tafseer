<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>This
is a very important Surah in which light has been thrown on some
questions of grave significance with reference to some incidents
concerning the wives of the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's
peace). </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>First,
that the powers to prescribe the bounds of the lawful and the
unlawful, the permissible and the forbidden, are entirely and
absolutely in the hand of Allah and nothing has been delegated even
to the Prophet of Allah himself, not to speak of any other man. The
Prophet as such can declare something lawful or unlawful only if he
receives an inspiration from Allah to do so whether that inspiration
is embodied in the Qur'an, or imparted to, him secretly. However,
even the Prophet is not authorized to declare anything made
permissible by Allah unlawful by himself, much less to say of another
man. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Second,
that in any society the position of a Prophet is very delicate. A
minor incident experienced by an ordinary man in his life may not be
of any consequence, but it assumes the status of law when experienced
by a Prophet. That is why the lives of the Prophets have been kept
under close supervision by Allah so that none of their acts, not even
a most trivial one, may deviate from Divine Will. Whenever such an
act has emanated from a Prophet, it was rectified and rectified
immediately so that the Islamic law and its principles should reach
the people in their absolute purity not only through the Divine Book
but also through the excellent example of the Prophet, and they
should include nothing which may be in disagreement with Divine Will,
</FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-decoration: none">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Thirdly,
and this automatically follows from the above mentioned point, that
when the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was checked on a minor
thing, which was not only corrected but also recorded, it gives us
complete satisfaction that whatever actions and commands and
instructions we now find in the pure life of the Holy Prophet
concerning which there is nothing on record in the nature of
criticism or correction from Allah, they are wholly based on truth,
are in complete conformity with Divine Will and we can draw guidance
from them with full confidence and peace of mind. </FONT></FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
fourth thing that we learn from this discourse is that about the Holy
Messenger himself, whose reverence and respect Allah Himself has
enjoined as a necessary part of the Faith of His servants, it has
been stated in this Surah that once during his sacred life he made a
thing declared lawful by Allah unlawful for himself only to please
his wives; then Allah has severely reproved for their errors those
very wives of the Holy Prophet, whom He Himself has declared as
mothers of the faithful and worthy of the highest esteem and honor by
them. Then, this criticism of the Prophet and the administration of
the warning to the wives also has not been made secretly but included
in the Book, which the entire </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Ummah</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">has to read and recite for ever.
Obviously, neither the intention of making mention of it in the Book
of Allah was, nor it could be, that Allah wanted to degrade His
Messenger and the mothers of the faithful in the eyes of the
believers; and this also is obvious that no Muslim has lost respect
for them, in his heart after reading this Surah of the Qur'an. Now,
there cannot be any other reason of mentioning this thing in the
Qur'an than that Allah wants to acquaint the believers with the
correct manner of reverence for their great personalities. The
Prophet is a Prophet, not God, that he may commit no error. Respect
of the Prophet has not been enjoined because he is infallible, but
because he is a perfect representative of Divine Will, and Allah has
not permitted any of his errors to pass by unnoticed. This gives us
the satisfaction that the noble pattern of life left by the Prophet
wholly and fully represents the will of Allah. Likewise, the
Companions of the holy wives of the Prophet, were human, not angels
or super men. They could commit mistakes. Whatever ranks they
achieved became possible only because the guidance given by Allah and
the training imparted by Allah's Messenger had moulded them into the
finest models. Whatever esteem and reverence they deserve is on this
very basis and not on the presumption that they were infallible. For
this reason, whenever in the sacred lifetime of the Prophet (upon him
be peace) the Companions or holy wives happened to commit an error
due to human weakness, they were checked. Some of their errors were
corrected by the Holy Prophet, as has been mentioned at many places
in the </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hadith</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">;
some other errors were mentioned in the Qur'an and Allah Himself
corrected them so that the Muslims might not form any exaggerated
notion of the respect and reverence of their elders and great men,
which might raise them from humanity to the position of gods and
goddesses. If one studies the Quran carefully, one will see instances
of this one after the other. In Surah Al-Imran, in connection with
the Battle of Uhud, the Companions have been addressed and told: </FONT></FONT></SPAN>

did fulfill His promise (of help) to you : in the initial stage of
the battle, it was you who were killing them by Allah's leave until
you lost heart and disputed about your duty and disobeyed your
leader, when Allah showed you what (the spoils) you coveted for there
were among you sortie who hankered after the life of this world, and
others: who cherished the life after death. Then Allah caused your
retreat before the disbelievers in order to test you, but the fact is
that even then Allah pardoned you, for Allah is very gracious to the
believers.&quot; (v. 152). </FONT></FONT></FONT>

scourge would have visited you because of the slander. (Just
consider) when you passed this lie on from one tongue to the other

took it as a trifling matter whereas it was a grave offense in the
sight of Allah. Why did you not, as soon as you heard of it, say 'It
is not proper for us to utter such a thing? Glory be to Allah! This
is a great slander'.&quot;Allah admonishes you that in future you
should never repeat anything like this, if you are true believers.&quot;

Commentary of the Qur'an and History, not only have the excellences
and great merits of the Companions and holy wives and other
illustrious men been mentioned, but also no hesitance has been shown
in mentioning the incidents relating to their weaknesses, errors and
mistakes, whereas those scholars were more appreciative of the merits
and excellences of the great men and understood the bounds and limits
of reverence better than those who claim to be the upholders of
reverence for the elders today. </FONT></FONT></SPAN>
</P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The
fifth thing that has been explicitly mentioned in this Surah is that
Allah's Religion is absolutely fair and just. It has for every person
just that of which he becomes worthy on the basis of his faith and
works. No relationship or connection even with the most righteous
person can be beneficial for him in any way and no relationship or
connection with the most evil and wicked person can be harmful for
him in any way. In this connection three kinds of women have been
cited as examples before the holy wives in particular. One example is
of the wives of the Prophets Noah and Lot, who, if they had believed
and cooperated with their illustrious husbands, would have occupied
the same rank and position in the Muslim community. which is enjoyed
by the wives of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be Allah's peace
and blessings). But since they were disbelievers, their being the
wives of the Prophets did not help them and they fell into Hell. The
second example is of the wife of Pharaoh, who in spite of being the
wife of a staunch enemy of God believed and chose a path of action
separate from that followed by the Pharaoh's people, and her being
the wife of a staunch disbeliever did not cause her any harm, and
Allah made her worthy of Paradise. The third example is of Hadrat
Maryam (Mary) (peace be upon her), who attained to the high rank
because she submitted to the severe test to which Allah had decided
to put her. Apart from Mary no other chaste and righteous girl in the
world ever has been put to such a hard test that in spite of being
unmarried, she might have been made pregnant miraculously by Allah's
command and informed what service her Lord willed to take from her.
When Hadrat Maryam accepted this decision, and agreed to bear, like a
true believer, everything that she inevitably had to bear in order to
fulfill Allah's will, then did Allah exalt her to the noble rank of

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Besides,
another truth that we learn from this Surah is that the Holy Prophet
(upon whom be peace) did not receive from Allah only that knowledge
which is included and recorded in the Qur'an, but he was given
information about other things also by revelation, which has not been
recorded in the Qur'an. Its clear proof is verse 3 of this Surah. In
it we are told that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) confided a
secret to one of his wives, and she told it to another. Allah
informed the Holy Prophet of this secret. Then, when the Holy Prophet
warned his particular wife on the mistake of disclosure and she
said:&quot;Who has informed you of this mistake of mine7&quot; he
replied: &quot;I have been informed of it by Him Who knows everything
and is All Aware.&quot; Now, the question is where in the Qur'an is
the verse in which Allah has said &quot;O Prophet, the secret that
you had confided to one of your wives, has been disclosed by her to
another person, or to so and so?If there is no such verse in the
Qur'an, and obviously there is none, this is an express proof of the
fact that revelation descended on the Holy Prophet besides the Qur'an
as well. This refutes the claim of the deniers of </FONT></FONT></SPAN><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Hadith</FONT></FONT></SPAN></EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: none"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT COLOR="#000000">,

	is not, in fact, a question but an expression of disapproval. The
	object is not to ask the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace)
	why he had done so, but to warn him that his act to make unlawful
	for himself what Allah had made lawful is not approved by Allah.
	This by itself gives the meaning that nobody has the power to make
	unlawful what Allah has made lawful; so much so that the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace) himself also did not possess any such
	power. Although the Holy Prophet did not regard this as unlawful as
	a matter of faith nor legally but only forbade himself its use, yet
	since he was not an ordinary man but Allah's Messenger, and his
	forbidding himself something could have the effect that his
	followers too would have regarded it as forbidden, or at least
	reprehensible, or the people of his community might have thought
	that there was no harm in forbidding oneself something his Allah had
	made lawful, Allah pointed it out to him and commanded him to
	refrain from such prohibition.&nbsp;

<DIV ID="sdfootnote2">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote2sym" HREF="#sdfootnote2anc">2</A>This
	shows that in this case the Holy Prophet had not made a lawful thing
	unlawful because of a personal desire but because his wives had
	wanted him to do so, and he had made it unlawful for himself only in
	order to please them. Here, the question arises: why has Allah
	particularly made mention of the cause of making the thing unlawful
	besides pointing out the act of prohibition? Obviously, if the
	object had been to make him refrain from making a lawful thing
	unlawful, this could be fulfilled by the first sentences and there
	was no need that the motive of the act also should have been stated.
	Making mention of it in particular clearly shows that the object was
	not to check the Holy Prophet only for making a lawful thing
	unlawful, but along with that to warn the holy wives also to the
	effect that in their capacity as the Prophet's wives they had not
	understood their delicate responsibilities and had made the Holy
	Prophet do a thing which could lead to making a lawful thing
	unlawful. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Although
	it has not been mentioned ill the Qur'an as to what it was that the
	Holy Prophet had forbidden himself yet the traditionists and
	commentators have mentioned in this regard two different incidents,
	which occasioned the revelation of this verse. One of these relates
	to Hadrat Mariyah Qibiyyah (Mary, the Copt lady) and the other to
	his forbidding himself the use of honey. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	incident relating to Hadrat Mariyah is that after concluding the
	peace treaty of Hudaibiyah one of the letters that the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be Allah's peace) sent to the rulers of the adjoining
	countries was addressed to the Roman Patriarch of Alexandria also,
	whom the Arabs called Muqawqis. When Hadrat Hatib bin Abi Balta a
	took this letter to him, he did not embrace Islam but received him
	well, and in reply wrote: &quot;I know that a Prophet is yet to
	rise, but I think he will appear in Syria. However, I have treated
	your messenger with due honor, and am sending two slave-girls to
	you, who command respect among the Coptics. &quot; (Ibn Sa'd). One
	of those slave-girls was Sirin and the other Mariyah (Mary). Un his
	way back from Egypt Hadrat Hatib presented Islam before both and
	they believed. When they came before the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) he gave Sirin in the ownership of Hadrat Hassan bin Thabit
	and admitted Hadrat Mariyah into his own household. In Dhil-Hijjah,
	A.H. 8 she gave birth to the Holy Prophet's son, Ibrahim.
	(Al-Isti'ab; Al-Isabah). This lady was very beautiful. Hafiz Ibn
	Hajar in Al-Isabah has related this saying of Hadrat 'A'ishah about
	her: &quot;No woman's entry into the Holy Prophet's household vexed
	me so much as of Mariyah, because she was very beautiful and pleased
	him much. &quot; Concerning her the story that has been narrated in
	several ways in the Hadith is briefly as follows:</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One day
	the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) visited the house of Hadrat
	Hafsah when she was not at home. At that time Hadrat Mariyah came to
	him there and stayed with him in seclusion. Hadrat Hafsah took it
	very ill and complained of it bitterly to him. Thereupon, in order
	to please her the Holy Prophet vowed that he would have no conjugal
	relation with Mariyah in future. According to some traditions, he
	forbade Mariyah for himself, and according to others, he also swore
	an oath on it. These traditions have been mostly reported by the
	immediate successors of the Companions without mentioning any
	intermediary link. But some of these have been reported from Hadrat
	'Umar,. Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Abbas and Hadrat Abu Hurairah also. In
	view of the plurality of the methods of narration, Hafiz Ibn Hajar
	in Fath al-Bari has expressed the view that there is some truth in
	the story. But in none of the six authentic collections of the
	Hadith has this story been narrated. In Nasa'i only this much has
	been related from Hadrat Anas: &quot;The Holy Prophet had a
	slave-girl with whom he had conjugal relations. Then, Hadrat Hafsah
	and Hadrat `A'ishah began to point out this to him repeatedly until
	he forbade her for himself. There upon, Allah sent down this verse:
	'O Prophet. why do you make unlawful that which Allah has made
	lawful for you?&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The other
	incident has been related in Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i and
	several other books of Hadith from Hadrat `A'ishah herself and its
	purport is as follows: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&ldquo;The
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) usually paid a daily visit to all
	his wives after the `Asr Prayer Once it so happened that he began to
	stay in the house of Hadrat Zainab bint-Jahsh longer than usual, for
	she had received some honey from somewhere as a gift and the Holy
	Prophet was very fond of sweet things; therefore, he would have a
	drink of honey at her house. Hadrat 'A'ishah states that she felt
	envious of this and spoke to Hadrat Hafsah, Hadrat Saudah and Hadrat
	Safiyyah about it and together they decided that whoever of them was
	visited by the Holy Prophet, she should say to him: 'Your mouth
	smells of maghafir ' Maghafir is a kind of flower, which gives out
	an offensive smell, and if the bee obtains honey from it, it is also
	tainted by the same odor. They all knew that the Holy Prophet was a
	man of very fine taste and he abhorred that he should emit any kind
	of unpleasant smell. There fore, this device was contrived to stop
	him from staying in the house of Hadrat Zainab and it worked. When
	several of his wives told him that his mouth smelt of Maghafir, he
	made a promise not to use the honey any longer. In one tradition his
	words are to the effect &quot;Now, I will never have a drink from
	it: I have sworn an oath. &quot; In another tradition he only said:
	&quot;I will never have a drink from it,&quot; and there is no
	mention of the oath And in the tradition which Ibn al Mundhir, Ibn
	Abi Hatim, Tabarani and Ibn Marduyah have related from Ibn 'Abbas
	the words are to the effect: &quot;By God, I will not drink it!&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Our
	eminent scholars regard this second version as correct and the first
	as unreliable. Imam Nasa'i says: &quot;About honey the Hadith
	reported from Hadrat 'A'ishah is authentic, and the story of
	forbidding Hadrat Mariyah for himself by the Holy Prophet has not
	been narrated in a reliable way.&quot; Qadi 'Iyad says: &quot;The
	truth is that this verse was sent down concerning honey and not
	Mariyah.&quot; Qadi Abu Bakr Ibn al-'Arabi; also regards the story
	about honey as correct and the same is the opinion of Imam Nawawi
	and Hafiz Badruddiu 'Aini. Ibn Humam writes in Fath al-Qadir &quot;The
	story of the prohibition of honey has been narrated in Bukhari and
	Muslim from Hadrat `A'ishah who was herself a party to it;
	therefore, it is much more reliable.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hafiz Ibn
	Kathir says: &quot;The truth is that this verse was sent down about
	forbidding honey for himself by the Holy Prophet.&quot;</P>

	means: &quot;Act according to the method Allah has prescribed for
	absolution from oaths by expiation in Al-Ma'idah :89 and break your
	promise that you have trade to forbid yourself a lawful thing. &quot;
	Here, an important legal question arises and it is this: Is this
	Command applicable to the case when a person has forbidden himself a
	lawful thing on oath, or is forbidding oneself a lawful thing by
	itself tantamount to swearing an oath, whether the words of the oath
	have been used or not'? The jurists in this regard have expressed
	different opinions: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">One
	section of them says that mere forbidding oneself a lawful thing is
	not an oath. If a person without swearing an oath has forbidden
	himself a wife, or some other lawful thing, it is an absurd thing
	which does not entail any expiation, but he can resume without any
	expiation the use of the thing that he had forbidden himself. This
	is the opinion of Masruq, Sha'bi, Rabi'ah and Abu Salamah; and the
	same view is held by Ibn Jarir and all the Zahiris. According to
	them forbidding oneself something would be an oath only in case
	express words of oath are used when forbidding it for oneself. In
	this regard, their reasoning is that since the Holy Prophet (upon
	whom be peace) while forbidding himself a lawful thing had also
	sworn an oath, as has been reported in several traditions, Allah
	told him to act according to the method that had been appointed for
	absolving oneself from oaths. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	second group says that to forbid oneself something without using the
	words of oath is not an oath by itself, but the case of the wife is
	an exception. If a person has forbidden himself a garment, or an
	article of food, it is meaningless, and one can use it without
	expiation. But if concerning a wife or a slave-girl he has said: &quot;I
	forbid myself an intercourse with her,&quot; she would not become
	unlawful and forbidden, but one would have to expiate the oath
	before going in to her. This is the opinion of the Shafe'is. (Mugni
	al-Muhtaj). And a similar opinion on this question is held by the
	Malikis. (Ibn al-'Arabi, Ahkam al-Qur an). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The third
	group says that to forbid oneself something is by itself an oath
	even if the words of oath have not been used. This is the opinion of
	Hadrat Abu Bakr. Hadrat 'A'ishah, Hadrat 'Umar, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin
	Mas'ud, Hadrat Zaid bin Thabit and Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas (may
	Allah bless them all). Although from Ibn 'Abbas another opinion has
	been reported in Bukhari to the effect: &quot;If a man has forbidden
	himself his wife, it is meaningless,&quot; yet it has been
	interpreted to mean that according to him this is not divorce but an
	oath which entails an expiation. For in Bukhari, Muslim and Ibn
	Majah, another saying of Ibn 'Abbas has been reported that to forbid
	oneself one's wife entails an expiation, and in Nasa'i the tradition
	is to the effect that when Ibn 'Abbas was asked his opinion on this,
	he said: &quot;She is not forbidden to you, but you must pay the
	expiation.&quot; and in Ibn Jarir's tradition the words of Ibn
	'Abbas are to the effect: &quot;If the people forbid themselves what
	Allah has made lawful for them, they must expiate their oath.&quot;
	This same is the opinion of Hasan Basri, 'Ata, Ta'us. Suleman bin
	Yasar. Ibn Jubair and Qatadah, and the same has been adopted by the
	Hanafis. Imam Abu Bakr al-Jassas says: `The words of the verse lima
	tuharrimu do not indicate that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace)
	along with forbidding himself the lawful thing had also sworn an
	oath, therefore, one will have to admit that tahrim (to forbid
	oneself something) itself is an oath; for after it Allah made
	obligatory the expiation of the oath in connection with the
	prohibition.&quot; Farther on he writes again: 'Our companions (i.e.
	the Hanafis) regard tahrim as an oath in case it is not accompanied
	by the intention of divorce. If a person forbade himself his wife,
	he in fact said: &quot;By God, I will not come near you,&quot; thus,
	he committed ila' (act of temporary separation! . And if he forbade
	himself an article of food. etc, he in a way said: &quot;By God, I
	will not use that article.&quot; For Allah first said: &quot;Why do
	you forbid that which Allah has made lawful?&quot; and then said.
	&quot;Allah has appointed a way to absolve you from your oaths.&quot;
	Thus, Allah has regarded tahrim as an oath, and the word tahrim in
	its meaning and legal effect becomes synonymous with an oath.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here, for
	the benefit of the common man, it would be useful to tell what is
	the legal command according to the jurists in respect of forbidding
	oneself one's wife and forbidding oneself other things besides the
	wife. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Hanafis say that if without the intention of divorce somebody
	forbade himself his wife, or swore an oath that he would not have
	conjugal relations with her, this would be ila (temporary
	separation), and in this cast he would have to expiate his oath
	before having the sexual relation. But if with the intention Of
	divorce he said: &quot;You are unlawful to me,&quot; it will have to
	be ascertained what was his actual intention. If his intention was
	of three divorces, the three divorces will take place, and if the
	intention was of a lesser number, of one or two divorces, only one
	divorce will take place in either case. And if some body says: &quot;I
	have forbidden myself whatever was lawful for me, this would not
	apply to the wife unless he said these words with the intention of
	forbidding himself the wife. Apart from the wife, one cannot use the
	thing O11e has forbidden oneself until one has expiated the oath.
	Badai as-Sana'i: Hedayah; Fath Al-Qadir,' al-Jassas, Ahkam al-Qur
	an.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Shafe'is say that if one forbids oneself the wife with the intention
	of divorce or zihar, the intended thing would become effective,
	whether it is a revocable divorce or an irrevocable divorce, or
	zihar. And if a person used the words of tahrim with the intention
	of both divorce and zihar, he would be asked to choose one, or the
	other, for both divorce and zihar cannot be established at one and
	the same time. Divorce dissolves marriage but in case of zihar it
	continues and if without any intention the wife is forbidden, she
	would not become forbidden, but expiation of the oath would become
	necessary. And if another thing, apart from the wife, is forbidden,
	it would be meaningless; there is no expiation for it. (Mughni
	al-Muhtaj). 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	Malikis say that if a person forbids himself anything other than the
	wife, it neither becomes forbidden nor entails an expiation. But if
	he says to the wife, &quot;You are unlawful, or unlawful for me, or
	I am unlawful for you,&quot; this would amount to a triple divorce
	in any case whether this was said to a wife with whom marriage has
	been consummated, or to one with whom it has not yet been
	consummated, unless his intention was of less than three divorces.
	Asbagh says: 'If a person says: whatever was lawful for me, is
	unlawful, the wife also becomes forbidden unless he makes an
	exception of the wife.&quot; In al-Mudawwanah, distinction has been
	made between the wife with whom marriage has been consummated and
	the wife with whom it has not been consummated. If one forbids
	oneself the former, a threefold divorce will take place irrespective
	of the intention, but in case of the latter the same number of
	divorces would take effect as was intended, and if there was no
	intention of any particular number, it would be considered a triple
	divorce (Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi). Qadi Ibn al-'Arabi in his Ahkam
	al-Qur'an has cited three statements of Imam Malik: (1) That
	forbidding oneself the wife amounts to an irrevocable divorce; (2)
	that it amounts to three divorces; and (3) that in case of the wife
	with whom marriage has been consummated it amounts to three
	divorces, bat in case of the one with whom it has not been
	consummated, to only one divorce if one was intended Then he says:
	'The correct thing is that forbidding oneself the wife amounts to
	one divorce only. for if the man uses the word divorce instead of
	calling her unlawfirl without specifying the number, only one
	divorce will take place.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Three
	different views in this regard have been reported from Imam Ahmad

	things have been reported in different traditions, saying that the
	Holy Prophet had told such and such a thing to one of his wives in
	confidence, which she disclosed to another wife. But for us, in the
	first place, it is not right to investigate it, for it is on the
	disclosure of a secret that Allah is taking a wife to task it cannot
	therefore be right for us to inquire into it and try to uncover it.
	Secondly, in view of the object for which this verse was sent down,
	it is not at all important to know what the secret was. Had it any
	connection with the object of the discourse, Allah would Himself
	have mentioned it The real object for which this incident has been
	related in the Qur'an is to warn the Holy Prophet's wives and.
	through them, the wives of the responsible people among the Muslims
	not to be careless in the matter of guarding secrets. Had it been
	only a private and personal affair, as is generally the case between
	the husband and the wife in the world there was no need that Allah
	should have directly informed the Holy Prophet of it through
	revelation, and then did not rest content only with giving the
	information, but should also have recorded it in the Holy Book which
	the whole world has to recite forever. The reason why it was given
	such importance was that this wife was not the wife of an ordinary
	husband but of that illustrious husband, whom Allah had appointed to
	the office of the highest responsibility, who was locked in an
	incessant battle with the disbelievers, polytheists and hypocrites
	at all times and under whose leadership a fierce conflict was going
	on for establishing Islam in place of paganism. In the house of such
	an illustrious man there could be countless things which if not kept
	secret but disclosed before time, could harm the great mission which
	he was performing. Therefore, when a lady of the house happened to
	show this weakness for the first time in that she disclosed a secret
	that had been told her in confidence, to another (a member of her
	own household), the weakness was immediately pointed out to her, not
	secretly but openly in the Qur'an, so as to impart training in the
	guarding of secrets not only to the wives of the Holy Prophet but
	also to the wives of all responsible people of the Muslim community.
	In the verse the question whether the secret disclosed pertained to
	a matter of any consequence or not, and whether its disclosure could
	cause any harm to the mission or not, has been altogether ignored.
	What has been disapproved and pointed out in particular is that the
	secret was disclosed to another. The higher the position of
	responsibility a person holds the more dangerous would be the
	leakage of secrets from his house. No matter whether a thing is of
	any consequence or not, once a person becomes careless in the matter
	of guarding secrets, he may reveal important things as well as
	trivial matters.&nbsp;

	Prophet's wives only have been discussed continuously, and this
	becomes obvious from the style of the Qur'an itself. .As for the

	of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas has been related, which describes the
	incident with sane variation in wording. Ibn 'Abbas says: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">&quot;I
	had been thinking a long time to ask Hadrat 'Umar as to who were the
	two of the Holy Prophet's wives, who had joined each other against
	him, and about whom Allah sent down this verse: In tatuba.....; but
	I could not muster courage because of his awe-inspiring personality
	until he left for Hajj and I accompanied him. On our way back while
	helping him to perform ablutions for the Prayer at one place I had
	an opportunity to ask him this question. He replied: they were
	'A'ishah and Hafsah. Then he began to relate the background, saying:
	&quot;We, the people of Quraish, were used to keeping our women folk
	under strict control. Then. when we came to Madinah, we found that
	the people here were under the control of their wives, and the women
	of Quraish too started learning the same thing from them. One day
	when I became angry with my wife, I was amazed to see that she
	argued with me. I felt badly about her conduct. She said, 'Why
	should you feel so angry at my behavior? By God, the wives of the
	Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) answer him back face to face,'
	(the word in the original is li yuraji nahu) and some one of them
	remains angrily apart from hire for the whole day. (According to
	Bukhari: the Holy Prophet remains angry and- apart from her the
	whole day). Hearing this I came out of my house and went to Hafsah
	(who was Hadrat `Umar's daughter and the Holy Prophet's wife). I
	asked her. Do you answer back to the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) face to face? She said: Yes. asked: And does one of you
	remain apart from him for the whole day (According to Bukhari: the
	Holy Prophet remains angry and apart from her for the entire day).
	She said: Yes. I said: Wretched is the one from among you, who
	behaves thus. Has one of you become so fearless of this that Allah
	should afflict her with His wrath because of the wrath of His
	Prophet and she should perish? So, do not be rude to the Prophet
	(here also the words are: la turaji-'i), nor demand of him anything,
	but demand of me whatever you desire. Do not be misled by this that
	your neighbor (i.e. Hadrat `A'ishah) is more beautiful and dearer to
	the Holy Prophet. After this I left her house and went to the house
	of Umm Salamah, who was related to me, and talked to her on this
	subject. She said: Son of Khattab, you are a strange man: you have
	meddled in every matter until you are now interfering in the affair
	between Allah's Messenger and his wives. She discouraged me. Then it
	so happened that an Ansari neighbor came to my house at night and he
	called out to me. We used to sit in the Holy Prophet's assembly by
	turns and each used to pass on to the other the news of the day of
	his turn. It was the time when we were apprehending an attack by the
	Ghassanids any time. On his call when I came out of my house, he
	said that something of grave significance had happened. 1 said: Have
	the Ghassanids launched an attack? He said: No, but something even
	more serious! The Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has divorced his
	wives. I said: Doomed is Hafsah (the words in Bukhari are: Raghima
	anfu Hafsah wa `Aishah). I already had a premonition of this.&quot;</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">We have
	left out what happened after this, how next morning Hadrat 'Umar
	went before the Holy Prophet and tried to appease his anger. We have
	described this incident by combining the traditions of Musnad Ahmad
	and Bukhari. In this the word muraj`at which Hadrat `Umar has used
	cannot be taken in its literal sense, but the context shows that the
	word has been used in the sense of answering back face to face and
	Hadrat `Umar's saying to his daughter: La turaji- `I Rasul Allah
	clearly has the meaning: Do not be impudent to the Messenger of
	Allah, Some people say that this is a wrong translation, and their
	objection is: Although it is correct to translate muraja `at as
	answering hack, or answering hack face to face, yet it is not
	correct to translate it as &quot;bing impudent&quot; . These
	objectors do not understand that if a person of a lower rank or
	position answers back or retorts to a person of a higher rank and
	position, or answers him back face to face this very thing is
	described as impudence. For example, if a father rebukes his son for
	something or feels angry at his behaviour, and the son instead of
	keeping quiet or offering an excuse, answers back promptly this
	could only he described as impudence. Then, when the matter is not
	between a father and a son, but between the Messenger of Allah and
	an individual of his community, only a foolish person could say that
	it was not impudence. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Some
	other people regard this translation of ours as disrespectful,
	whereas it could be disrespectful in case we had had the boldness to
	use such words in respect of Hadrat Hafsah from ourselves. We have
	only given the correct meaning of the words of .Hadrat 'Umar, and
	these words he had used while scolding and reproving his daughter
	for her error. Describing it as disrespectful would mean that either
	the father should treat his daughter with due respect and reverence
	even when scolding and rebuking her or else the translator should
	render his rebuke and reproof in a way as to make it sound
	respectful and reverent. 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Here,
	what needs to be considered carefully is that if it was such an
	ordinary and trivial matter that when the Holy Prophet said
	something to his wives they would retort to Him, why was it given so
	much importance that in the Qur'an Allah administered a severe
	warning directly to the wives themselves? And why did Hadrat 'Umar
	take it as such a grave matter that first he reproved his own
	daughter, then visited the house of the other wives and asked them
	to fear the wrath of Allah? And, about all, was the Holy Prophet
	(upon whom be peace) also so sensitive that he would take offense at
	minor things and become annoyed with his wives, and was he, God
	forbid, so irritable that once having been annoyed at such things he
	had severed his connections with all his wives and retired to his
	private apartment in seclusion? If a person considers these
	questions deeply, he will inevitably have to adopt one of the two
	views in the explanation of these verses Either on account of his
	excessive concern for reverence for the holy wives he should not at
	all mind if a fault is imputed to Allah and His Messenger, or else
	he should admit in a straightforward way that at that time the
	attitude and behavior of these holy wives has actually become so
	objectionable that the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) was
	justified in becoming annoyed over it, and more than that, Allah
	Himself was justified that He should administer a severe warning to
	the wives on their unseemly behavior and attitude.&nbsp;

	No light has been thrown on the nature of the error in the Qur'an.
	However, some details are found in the Hadith, which we shall relate
	below.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In
	Bukhari, a tradition has been reported from Hadrat Anas, saying that
	Hadrat 'Umar said: &quot;The Holy Prophet's wives because of their
	mutual envies and rivalries had utterly displeased him. At this I
	said to them: It may well be that if the Holy Prophet divorced you,
	Allah would give him in your place better wives than you. &quot; Ibn
	Abi Hatim has, on the authority of Hadrat Anas, reported the
	statement of Hadrat Umar in these words: &quot;I was informed that a
	discord had been created between the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) and his wives. At this I went to each of them and asked them
	to refrain from vexing the Holy Prophet; otherwise Allah would give
	him in their stead better wives than them selves. So much so that
	when I went to the last of them (and according to a tradition of
	Bukhari, to Umm Salamah), she said to me: O `Umar, is not the Holy
	Prophet (upon whom be peace) himself enough to admonish his wives?
	Then why should you come out to counsel them? This made me quiet,
	and after this Allah sent down this verse.' 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In
	Muslim, Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Abbas has related that Hadrat 'Umar
	said to him: &quot;When the Holy Prophet (upon whom be Allah's
	peace) separated himself from his wives, I went to the Mosque and
	found the people worried and upset and playing with pebbles and
	saying to one another: 'The Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) has
	divorced his wives.' After this Hadrat `Umar related his visiting
	the apartments of Hadrat 'A'ishah and Hafsah and admonishing them.
	then said: I went before the Holy Prophet (upon whom be peace) and
	said: Why do you feel upset with regard to your wives? If you
	divorce them, Allah is with you, all the angels and Gabriel and
	Michael arc with you, and I and Abu Bakr and all the Believers are
	with you. I thank Allah that seldom has it so happened that I said a
	thing and did not have hope from Allah that He would testify to what
	I said. So, after this these verses of Surah At-Tahrim were sent
	down. Then I asked the Holy Prophet: Have you divorced your wives'?
	He said: No. Thereupon I stood at the entrance of the Mosque and
	announced in a loud voice: The Holy Prophet has not divorced his
	wives.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">The
	traditions related in Bukhari from Hadrat Anas and in Musnad Ahmad
	from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin `Abbas, Hadrat 'A'ishah and Hadrat Abu
	Hurairah say that the Holy Prophet had pledged to remain away from
	his wives for a month and he retired in seclusion to his apartment.
	When 29 days passed, Gabriel carne and said; &quot;You have
	fulfilled your oath: a month has come to completion.&quot; 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">Hafiz
	Badruddin 'Aini in 'Umdat al-Qari has related this on the authority
	of Hadrat 'A'ishah: The wives of the Holy Prophet had become divided
	into two parties. one party consisted of Hadrat 'A'ishah herself and
	Hadrat Hafsah. Hadrat Saudah and Hadrat Safiyyah, and the other of
	Hadrat Zainab, Hadrat.Umm Salamah and the rest of the wives.</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">These
	traditions indicate to some extent the conditions ,that existed in
	the Holy Prophet's domestic life at that time, which made it
	necessary that Allah Almighty should intervene and reform the
	attitude of the holy wives. Although the wives were the best ladies
	of society, yet they were human beings and were not tree from human
	weaknesses. Sometimes when it became difficult for them to lead a
	life of continuous poverty and hardship, they would become restive,
	impatient and would start pressing the Holy Prophet for better
	maintenance. At this Allah sent down vv. 28-29 of Surah Al-Ahzab and
	admonished them to the effect: 'If you seek the world and its
	adornments,.our Messenger will give you of these and send you of in
	a good way. But if you seek Allah and His Messenger and the
	Hereafter, you should bear up against the hardships with patience,
	which you might have to face when living with the Messenger.&quot;
	(For details, see E.N. 41 of Surah Al-Ahzab and the Introduction to
	it). Then on account of the feminine nature they sometimes happened
	to behave in a way, which though not unusual in everyday human life,
	did not go well with the unique dignity and great responsibilities
	of the house to which Allah had given them the honor to belong. So,
	when it was apprehended that those things might embitter the Holy
	Prophet's domestic life and might even adversely affect the great
	mission that Allah had entrusted to him, He sent down this verse in
	the Qur'an, and reformed them so that the holy wives may realize the
	responsibilities of the position and rank which they had attained as
	the life-companions of the Last Messenger of Allah, and should not
	regard themselves as ordinary women and their household as a common
	household. The very first sentence of this verse was such as might
	have caused Their hearts to shudder. There could be no severer
	warning for them than ,this: `It may well be that if the Prophet
	divorces all of you, Allah will give him in your place better wives
	than yourselves.&quot; In the first place, even the thought of being
	divorced by the Prophet (upon whom be Allah's peace) was unbearable
	for them: more than that, this would deprive them of the honor of
	being Mothers of the Believers, and the other women whom Allah would
	give as wives to the Prophet would be better than them, After this
	it was no longer possible for the holy wives to behave in a way as
	would have occasioned a reproof from Allah. That is why we find only
	two places in the Qur'an where these select and distinguished ladies
	have been administered a warning, in Surah Al-Ahzab and here in
	Surah At-Tahrim.&nbsp;

	disbelievers while subjecting them to punishment in Hell. This by

<DIV ID="sdfootnote19">
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in"><A CLASS="sdfootnotesym" NAME="sdfootnote19sym" HREF="#sdfootnote19anc">19</A>Literally,
	&quot;taubat an-nasuh-an &quot;may either mean that one should offer
	such true repentance as may have no tinge of pretense and hypocrisy
	in it, or that one should wish one's own self well and repenting of
	sin should save oneself from the evil end, or that one should so
	adorn and improve one's life after repentance as to become a cause
	of admonition for others, and seeing his example others also may
	reform themselves accordingly. These are the meanings of taubat
	an-nasuh which- are indicated by its literal sense. As for its
	religious meaning, its explanation is found in the Hadith which Ibn
	Abi, Hatim has related on the authority of Zirr bin Hubaish. He
	says: &quot;When I asked Hadrat Ubayy bin Ka'b the meaning of taubat
	an-nasuh, he said that he had asked the Holy Prophet (upon whom be
	peace) the same question, and he had replied: 'It implies that when
	you happen to commit an error, you should feel penitent for it, then
	should implore Allah for forgiveness remorsefully, and then should
	refrain from committing the same error again.&quot; This same
	meaning has been reported from hadrat 'Umar. Hadrat 'Abdullah bin
	Mas'ud and Hadrat 'Abdullah bin `Abbas also, and in a tradition
	Hadrat 'Umar has defined taubat an-nasuh, thus: &ldquo;After
	offering repentance one should not even think of committing the sin,
	not to speak of repeating it.&quot; (Ibn Jarir) Hadrat 'Ali once
	heard a desert Arab chanting the words of repentance and forgiveness
	quickly and mechanically and remarked: &ldquo;This is the repentance
	of the liars.&rdquo; The man asked: &ldquo;What is true repentance?&rdquo;
	Hadrat 'Ali replied: &ldquo;It should be accompanied by six things: 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">(1) You
	should feel penitent for the wrong you have done: (2) you should
	carry out the duties that you have ignored; t3) restore the rights
	that you have usurped; (4) ask forgiveness of him whom you have
	wronged; (S) make a resolve not to repeat the sin again; and (6)
	consume yourself in obedience to Allah as you have so far been
	consuming it in wrongdoing, and cause it to taste the bitterness of
	obedience as you have so far been causing it to enjoy the sweet
	taste of disobedience and sin. &ldquo; (Al-Kashshaf) 
	</P>
	<P CLASS="sdfootnote-western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.2in">In
	connection with repentance there are some other points also which
	should be well understood: (1) That repentance, in fact, is to show
	remorse for an act of disobedience only because it is a disobedience
	of Allah; otherwise to make a resolve to refrain from a sin because
	it is harmful for health, for instance, or it is likely to cause
	defamation or financial loss, is no repentance; (2) that man should
	offer repentance as soon as he realizes that he has committed
	disobedience of Allah and should compensate for it without delay in
	whatever form possible and should not defer it in any way; (3) that
	violating one's repentance again and making a jest of repentance and
	repeating the sin again and again of which one has repented, is a
	proof of the falsity of one's repentance, for the essence of
	repentance, is penitence, and breaking one's repentance repeatedly
	is a sign that it has not been motivated by penitence; (4) that if
	the person who has repented sincerely and resolved not to repeat the
	sin again, happens to repeat it once again because of human
	weakness, it will not revive his past sin: however, he should offer
	a fresh repentance for the latter sin sod should resolve more firmly
	that he would not commit the sin in future; (5) that it is not
	necessary to renew one's repentance again every time one remembers
	the disobedience committed in the past, but if one's self derives
	pleasure from the remembrance of the past, sinful life, one should
	offer repentance again and again until the remembrance of the sins
	causes remorse instead of pleasure and enjoyment. For the person who
	has actually repented of disobedience because of fear of God cannot
	derive pleasure from the thought chat he has been disobeying God.
	His deriving pleasure from it is a sign that fear of God has not
	taken root in his heart.&nbsp;

	words of the verse deserve deep consideration. It has not been said
	chat if you repeat, you will surely be forgiven and will certainly
	be admitted to Paradise, but that: &quot;If you offer true
	repentance, it may well be that Allah will treat you kindly.&quot;
	It means that it is not incumbent upon Allah to accept the
	repentance of the sinner and to grant him Paradise instead of
	subjecting him to punishment but it will be His kindness and
	compassion that He may forgive well as reward His servant. One
	should have hope of His forgiveness, but one should not commit a sin
	with the confidence that one will achieve forgiveness by
	repentance.&nbsp;

	this verse is read along with w. 12-13 of Surah AI-Hadid, it becomes
	clear that the running on of the light before the believers will
	take place when they will be proceeding towards Paradise from the
	Plain of Resurrection. There it will be pitch dark all around and
	those who will have been condemned to Hell, will be groping; about
	in it; the light will only be with the believers by which they will
	be traveling on their way. On this critical occasion, hearing the
	wailings and groanings of those groping in the dark the believers
	will be feeling terror stricken. In view of their past errors and
	short-comings they will be afraid lest they too should be deprived
	of their light and made to grope about like those-wretched people.
	Therefore, they will pray: &quot;O our Lord, forgive us our sins and
	let our light remain with us until we reach Paradise.&quot; Ibn
	Jarir has cited Hadrat Abdullah bin 'Abbas as explaining the meaning
	of Rabbana-atimim lava nurana thus They will implore Allah Almighty
	that their light be allowed to remain with thetas and kept from
	going out until they have crossed the bridge across Hell.&quot; The
	commentary given by Hadrat Hasan Basri, Mujahid and Dahhak also is
	almost the same. Ibn Kathir has cited their this saying: &brvbar;When
	the believers see that the hypocrites have been deprived of the
	light, they will pray to Allah for the perfection of their light.&quot;
